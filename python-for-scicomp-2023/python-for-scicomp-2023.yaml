- workshop_title: Python for Scientific Computing 2023
- workshop_description: >
    Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python
    courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a
    basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
    Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools,
    such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is
    suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python
    and want to know some internals and important libraries for
    science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do
    introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.

    This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in
    Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific
    Computing.

  title: 1.4 Numpy
  description: >-
    Numpy is the standard Python array package.  It provides not only
    the basic data structure, but also plenty of operations on this
    data.  By using built-in functions, many operations can be
    vectorized and made much faster (just like they are done in any
    other high-level numerical language).  Many other scientific and
    numerical packages are build using Numpy, so it is very important
    to learn to use it well.

    Generating figures is part of the scientific process.  This should
    not be manual, but ideally they should be automatically generated in
    final form.  This makes your work reproducible, getting around
    "oh no I can't make it again" problems.

    In this lesson, we discuss the matplotlib Python library which can
    be used to make figures like this.  This isn't the only Python
    tool, and may not even be the best one, but it is the base of many
    other tools and a good point to learn the basic concepts you will
    apply over and over.

  description: >-

    Input/output bandwidth is just as much a consumable resource as
    CPU or memory.  And data formats are important for both ease
    (human effort) and time taken to read data.  Here, we will go over
    the basic concepts and some important data formats which you may
    need in your work.

    that are easy for a computer but hard or annoying for a human.
    Things like finding simple bugs or reformatting code.  We'll
    discuss linting and code formatting, and have a discussion about
    other things and how we actually usually work.

  description: >-

    Thus far, we have been running Python code from Jupyter notebooks
    (though the same principle applies to other environments such as
    Spyder or IDSs).  This doesn't easily allow you to scale up or
    scale out: if you need to run the same, or slightly different,
    code many times, it is hard.  There are ways to do this within
    Jupyter, but in the end you will want to escape and make command
    line interfaces.  This is the universal interface for automation,
    scale-out, and parameterization of work.  We give the quickest
    intro to this.
