1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,240
Yes, it worked.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,040
So we're going to the concluding remarks.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
and where to go from here, also known as the workshop outro.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,800
So thanks to everyone who was attending. This was a fun course to give. We had

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,920
a lot of new people and new instructors and we're getting closer to the sustainability

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,840
point of view. Thanks to everyone who attended. I don't know how many people were working in

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,800
teams here, so basically had people in an organized group together attending. But anyone

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,080
who was able to do that, thank you for coming. That's really good, exactly what we want.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,040
We would like to thank all of the instructors who are listed on the workshop webpage.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,760
I won't say their names again here, so I don't have to remove them from the videos. But yeah,

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,440
I mean, instructors have put in a lot of work to go and make this happen.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,840
We also had a bunch of people answering questions in the notes, as you may have seen and found.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
These people took a lot of time to do that, and the local partners who organized

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
any possible in-person things and so on.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,920
We'd like you to keep giving us feedback, so in the notes, you can keep adding things.

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,720
It is in there now.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,480
We see it's here, please keep adding stuff.

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:02:00,240
You can send us by email or you can join our chat if you wanted and say some things.

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,520
So you can always use Git itself by making issues or pull requests to help update our

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
lesson materials.

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:15,720
In fact, you could say that our whole course is a way, our whole course is a way, is teaching

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:24,520
you how to update our materials, because everything we use, we teach in the course.

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,240
And we keep developing based on your feedback, so let us know.

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,840
In about six months, you may get a post-workshop survey, which will basically ask how your

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,480
work has been changed and updated based on what you learned in this course.

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,800
is really important to fill out because it really provides the best indicator to

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,760
the people that fund us that we've done something useful and they will keep

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,560
funding it. So I'd really encourage you to keep studying and asking for support.

29
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,880
So this is a starting course but these are very applied and not theoretical

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,840
topics so most of what you'll learn will be on your own after this. So I would

31
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,120
say, starting off, you have the course and it gives you some ideas, lets you do some things.

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,800
But the next step is to work on things along with someone else. So someone who can be there

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,520
and help you answer your questions locally. We have these partners below we can talk about,

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
but even if it's just another colleague, do talk about the things you've learned here and

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,360
ask for help because it's new. And then, even after that's done, there's still plenty more

36
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,080
you'll be learning yourself. Never start doing web searches or whatever to find

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
new things that you can use based on what you've seen here.

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,960
We have these things called bring your own code sessions. And it's basically a way you can bring

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,440
your code or well I guess other questions and come talk to us instructors and we'll look at

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,040
things together with you and it's basically like a follow-up Q&A mentoring kind of session.

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,160
So this is a way we can help with the follow-up ourselves.

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,800
You can continue to review everything that we have here. The lessons stay available

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,440
indefinitely and get updates. As you know we have videos published. The main point of these videos

44
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:41,360
is for you, our learners now, to go and re-review things during yourself, afterwards. And you can

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,680
reuse these materials as much as you'd want. So there's a bunch of different partners that are

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,400
are part of the Code Refinery project.

47
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,320
I think, yeah, did we have, yeah,

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,440
I think we had people from all of these here.

49
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe not Denmark this time.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,160
But anyway, the point is that locally in your country,

51
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,280
you have people that hopefully want

52
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,200
to answer questions about these things

53
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
and then help you follow up.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,560
If you're at Aalto University, we have plenty of things.

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,880
basically come to our daily sessions anytime and we can follow up and help you do these

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
things.

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,760
And I think probably is the same for more of the stuff.

58
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,260
We just have listed the Nordic countries here because we're a Nordic project, but there's

59
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,480
more in other countries that you need to find yourself.

60
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,800
If you want a certificate, that's on the course webpage.

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,320
I don't really know much more other than what is there.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,520
So please read it yourself if you're interested.

63
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,640
Tell people about us.

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:59,440
So let people know that it's a good workshop and they should come in the future.

65
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,680
Or even recommend to your institution or yourself, join us as either a team leader or become

66
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,320
part of a team, an instructor in the future, a supporter.

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,880
There's all kinds of people doing stuff in the background, which we need help with to

68
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
keep stuff working.

69
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,540
So, yeah.

70
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,760
We already talked about these things.

71
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,720
The newsletter is a good way to hear of what's going on, other interesting tidbits, and so

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
on.

73
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,120
And if you really like the kind of things that we're talking about now, you can look

74
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,840
into this thing called research software engineers,

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,240
which is basically people that are researchers,

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,960
but they're focused more on the technology.

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
So they're more interested

78
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
in making the research technology better

79
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,920
rather than getting as many citations

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,780
as they can for themselves.

81
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,620
So it's a different kind of career path

82
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,840
that has a different kind of focus.

83
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
So it's still sort of a new thing in some places

84
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,840
but it's something that would be worth reading about.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Okay.

86
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
Any other comments or things from the notes?

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,780
I will switch there.

88
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
Let's see.

89
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,660
Please give feedback.

90
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,520
This is not much feedback and we need more

91
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,220
in order to see how it went.

92
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:42,920
Yeah, okay, there's a question here.

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,120
Are there any good AI tools which can automatically generate a test code?

94
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,880
I think there are probably some, but I don't know them myself.

95
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,920
I think someone will probably come in and fill in the answer later.

96
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah. Is there anything else?

97
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,920
Are there any other instructors around who want to

98
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,240
join the studio and say any final words?

99
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Yeah, I'm very happy I'm here today.

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a very good time to learn from each other.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,280
I saw quite good answers and comments,

102
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,600
suggestions in the notes.

103
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,200
I will read them through later.

104
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,240
Yeah. I think today went quite well overall.

105
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,880
So we had some good sessions.

106
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:58,840
And, yeah, the most sincere thanks to everyone who stuck with us all this time.

107
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:07,960
And yeah, I really hope that this will improve your work and that you can reteach these to

108
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,440
other people later on.

109
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Okay. So, I guess I will turn it off for now.

110
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Is there any final news? So, I think most of the news was in this outro session.

111
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,440
And there's no future session. So, yeah, that's that.

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Okay. Thank you, everyone. Bye.

113
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,940
Bye.

114
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,980
Thank you.

115
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,520
Bye.
