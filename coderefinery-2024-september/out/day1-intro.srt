1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060
Hi everyone, my name is [name]. I work at CSC in Finland and I will be guiding you through the

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,660
first 20 minutes of today's workshop. After that I will give the word to [name] and [name] who

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,660
will guide you through the rest of today's day, today's workshop. I'll be showing you around

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,460
a little bit how things are working in this workshop, so you may have noticed that things

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,300
are already maybe a little bit differently than you are used to, that you are watching on stream

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,260
and we are here somewhere else, but you can still see us and you can still also interact with us.

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,060
And for that you have gotten a link in your email either yesterday or when you registered to this

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:54,100
workshop which starts with nodes.coderefinery.org. This is our way on how you can interact with the

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,220
instructors and this is what I'm showing here on screen right now. So here you can find a few

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:09,140
links in the top for example to our code of conduct and if you encounter any issues,

11
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,340
anyone's not being nice, anything that you want to report, then you can follow this link

12
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,740
to get to a form that you can fill out to complain about it. Then everyone who is registered has

13
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,820
gotten this link, if you're not registered you can still do so and then in the registration

14
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,980
confirmation you will get this link to the notes. You can find the schedule here and from the

15
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,580
schedule, I can open it briefly, so this is the course page, you can also find the link to all the

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,380
materials. So we are right now welcoming introduction and then the introduction to

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,860
version control you can find behind these links. We'll also try to add that to the notes here.

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:04,900
We have here one suggestion for the screen setup. So as you may have noticed we are sharing in this

19
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,940
more portrait mode and that is so that you can have other stuff right next to it. And I think

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Was it so that Twitch has this, what was it called, pop-out window or what was it?

21
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,940
There's theater mode and there's also maybe a pop-out window, yeah.

22
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Yeah, so you can have the web browser with the stream on one side of your screen,

23
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,940
and then if you want to follow, for example, in the terminal, or if you want to follow in VS Code, or we will talk about that later,

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,620
whatever you else need and for example also this note you can have on the side.

25
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,780
And this document we will share once in a while on stream so please don't put any names or other

26
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,700
identifying information on this but other than that since you are not here with us in the Zoom

27
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,140
room but we are streamed to you there is no danger of you appearing on the stream.

28
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,980
We have put some icebreaker questions here,

29
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,780
so that we all get used to using the collaborative documents

30
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,220
and also to get to know how the weather is

31
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,100
wherever you are connecting from.

32
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,540
And let's briefly go through how you can do that.

33
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,420
So, my window is very narrow.

34
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,460
So, if I scroll up a little bit,

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,060
I will find a little pen symbol up here to the right.

36
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,780
And maybe I can even zoom.

37
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,140
Well, it doesn't really make it bigger.

38
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,180
a little pen symbol upright for you.

39
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,420
It might be somewhere here next to this HedgeDoc logo.

40
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,840
There is probably a eye, a book and a pen symbol.

41
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,640
It's always a pen symbol that you are looking for.

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
And if we click that, we go into edit mode

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
and then we can already see

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,740
someone is writing here right now.

45
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,340
So this is how we can all now go here

46
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,720
to the icebreaker question

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
and tell us how the weather is where you are.

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,820
And if you want some of the emojis also work here,

49
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,820
for example, we can add a sun with face

50
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,740
to my Espoo cloudy but warm thing.

51
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,620
So yeah, please let us know how is the weather

52
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,540
where you are, or we have already a lot of people here

53
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,960
joining from many different places.

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,100
That is really nice.

55
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,000
And then our second icebreaker question is,

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,980
have you used Git before?

57
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,380
So Git is what we will be talking about a lot this week.

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,560
It's not bad if you haven't heard about it at all,

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,400
please add a little O here in the end

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
if you don't know what Git is.

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,180
If you have used it before, you can add it to the yes,

62
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,940
or if you have heard but not used it before to the no.

63
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,080
So it's kind of a little voting system bar graph.

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,080
And if you want, you can also add some more comments below here, like you've seen some people have already done.

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:19,080
And then later, we will always add little sections here. And this is now the answer to [name]'s question. Sorry, it took a while.

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:28,080
So, whenever we go to the next section, we will add another header here, like this.

67
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
And then also the link to the materials.

68
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,080
And then later today we will also have exercise sessions,

69
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
where we will then tell you how long the exercise sessions are

70
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,080
and what you are supposed to be doing in those exercise sessions.

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,080
And just for you to know, there's many different ways on how someone can join this workshop.

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,080
So some of you might be watching it alone on stream and then do the exercises by yourself.

73
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,880
and then there's other people who met either in the same room locally or in

74
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,800
the same Zoom room to do the exercises together. And so we might sometimes say

75
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,280
like breakout rooms or local rooms or these kind of things just so you know

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,280
what we are talking about. So let's go briefly also to the introduction

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
materials here that we have collected. You can read through them also by

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
by yourself, we'll now go through them rather fast

79
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
in the next 10 minutes,

80
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,320
but we have also already done some of these things.

81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,240
So why are we here?

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,480
So Code Refinery is basically building on top

83
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,660
of more the general coding classes.

84
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,080
So we don't focus here on programming

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,980
or writing code so much,

86
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,640
but we are trying to support you to make your code

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,200
that you are already writing more reproducible.

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:12,360
And we have this really nice graphics here by [name] that we are always using to also explain a little bit what the course is about, because all of our lessons that will come up in the next six half days, this and next week, somehow fit in these six helpful steps for reproducible research.

89
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:20,440
So, we'll take a look at how you get your files and folders in order, why also good

90
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:28,920
naming for files, folders, and functions is quite important, how to document your codes

91
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,280
and maybe also your data, what are essential parts of a README file that you can add to

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:45,960
your code, what kind of metadata is needed, what are code comments and how you can use them,

93
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,200
and how you can write useful comments in your own code. Then what we'll start with today,

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:03,400
version control, what it is, why it matters, what it enables also, and then

95
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,080
Then mainly next week it's also a lot about stabilizing the computing environment and

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,720
the software you are using.

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,160
You may have heard about dependency management, containers and that kind of stuff.

98
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,660
So we'll briefly look into that as well.

99
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,360
And then also what goes into publishing your research outputs, like publishing your code

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,880
in specifically here, licensing, what kind of licenses are there, why would you want to

101
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,400
add one, and so on. So this really covers all the topics of these workshops.

102
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,360
And we are here from Code Refinery, so Code Refinery is the name of the workshop. It's also

103
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,240
the name of the project that runs these workshops and many others. We are Nordic Projects

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,400
and we teach this, let's say, more basic scientific computing tools and we are funded by the Nordic

105
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,040
Infrastructure Collaboration. And basically what we are, we are a community of research software

106
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,600
enthusiasts from all over the Nordics and beyond. And you can find our website here,

107
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,320
coderefinery.org, where you can find all kinds of things from the previous workshops,

108
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,600
workshops, all kinds of materials also from other workshops and the partners and whatever

109
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,760
else. You can also find how you can join us, so if this workshop is something that you

110
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,560
enjoy, and you would like to go further with this, you would like to maybe be part of the

111
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Code Refinery project, there is a whole page on how you can do that.

112
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,800
So we already talked a little bit about how these workshops work.

113
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,660
So we will have the live stream here.

114
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:05,160
We will have the collaborative notes for communication between you among yourselves and also towards

115
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,560
the instructors and also the instructors with you.

116
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,000
Sometimes we might add some questions to you in the collaborative notes also.

117
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,600
I'll show them in the end.

118
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:24,360
more. And then in week one, we will have the teaching happening here on stream by [name]

119
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,720
and [name] today. And then we will have exercises. And these you can, like I mentioned, either do by

120
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,080
yourself or in your team. Depends on how you're joining this. In week two, there is no dedicated

121
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:47,240
team exercise times anymore. So if you have joined a workshop some time ago already, that is

122
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,320
something that we have changed. There will be a lot of interaction via the collaborative document

123
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,240
and if you are meeting with your team, we highly recommend to just meet after the workshop and

124
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,840
talk through the exercises. And if you don't have a team, you can also join our Bring Your Own Code

125
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,160
sessions after the workshop and ask us questions about these exercises if you want to do them on

126
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:22,360
your own time. Then we plan on having a minimum of 10 minute break every hour and one hour break

127
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:31,880
at approximately lunchtime and the materials will stay available and are always linked from

128
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,640
this workshop page. The workshop page will also be available so you will always have everything

129
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:43,320
together. We will make the recordings available. You can watch them on Twitch still for a while

130
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,440
and then we also put them on YouTube. The collaborative document, we already talked about this.

131
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,360
I can show it again here. So it looks like this when you click on the link that was in

132
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,400
the registration confirmation email and then you can find this little pen symbol

133
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,600
to change into edit mode and answer our icebreakers here. First what's the weather

134
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,960
where you're connecting from and second one have you used git before and if you want you can also

135
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,000
add some comments and we already have someone writing here that you can also download the

136
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,160
videos from YouTube later. So no worries if you have to leave during the workshop or if you cannot

137
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:41,560
join for the whole day, you will be able to to catch up again. Sorry, I should find the right tab again.

138
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:52,520
While you are watching, it might be beneficial to keep the notes in the view mode, so that you can

139
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,520
do by clicking this eye symbol. Again it might be here up to the right or if you have a bit wider

140
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,200
window it might be up here on the left. Then you can still follow what's happening here like if

141
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,000
someone writes you still see it. But if we have a lot of people editing the document

142
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,120
it might be a bit more performant if most of us are in view mode.

143
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:26,920
And then there will be exercises this week as mentioned and for that so that you have a bit

144
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,200
easier life after the workshop we suggest to create your own course directory or course folder on your

145
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:43,080
computer that you are working on. This way you have it all in one place and you can then remove

146
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,880
it after the workshop without having to find all the different different directories again later.

147
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,720
We already talked about the screen arrangement so that you can find a way that works for you.

148
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,080
This is just our suggestion to have the theater mode for Twitch and then have the right side of

149
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,560
your screen for the collaborative nodes and your terminal or other tools that you need to open.

150
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:28,080
We suggest that your first priority always is to follow the live stream so that you can follow what is going on, what we're doing at every moment, and that's where the teaching is happening.

151
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,080
We know that this is a lot of different things to follow.

152
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:42,080
We have the live stream, we have the collaborative notes, we have the lesson materials, and then if you're doing exercises you probably have yet another window.

153
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:55,080
So live stream, I feel is the most important one, then the collaborative notes, and then the lesson materials webpage, we will be often sharing them on stream so you don't really need to have them open by yourself.

154
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,080
During teaching session at least.

155
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,880
So you can also have that close and really focus on the live stream.

156
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
And for the collaborative notes, if you have a question,

157
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,080
you add it to the bottom of the document and then someone will answer.

158
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,480
It might sometimes take a moment for answers to get in there.

159
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,880
So you also don't have to follow it at all times.

160
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,580
You can also then go back in the break or during exercise session

161
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,820
or after the workshop to check it.

162
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,420
So, we have shared the notes document.

163
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,300
This is also the document where you please let us know as early as possible

164
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,140
if there is any major accessibility problem.

165
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,620
Meaning either you can't hear us, something is not visible,

166
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,380
it seems like we want to share something, but you don't see that.

167
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,500
If we forget to have a break,

168
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:05,500
If there is an explanation that is unintelligible, please let us know right away so that we can fix it, so that we can make this a really nice experience for everyone.

169
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
No one has to suffer through bad audio, for example.

170
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:20,500
And also, since we have always multiple teachers, let us know if the volumes are balanced, so that not one is very loud and one is very low.

171
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:27,220
very low. We try to do that always in the beginning, but things may change. So please let us know.

172
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,620
There might be mistakes happening on the on the stream and we think that's a great

173
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,020
possibility for learning, so you can also see how our instructors fix their mistakes.

174
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,940
And if there is something due to that that you then didn't understand, for example,

175
00:16:45,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Then you can use this bring your own code sessions after the workshop to ask more questions about it, to ask more clarifications. We very welcome everyone to join those sessions. You will also get another invite for those later.

176
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:09,140
slide photos later. We covered that if the collaborative document is going too fast,

177
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:17,420
then just don't bother basically following it. You can always come back to it later.

178
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:24,140
If you have any trouble, any technical issues, you can of course ask in the collaborative

179
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,740
notes, but it might be that we cannot solve them for you. It might be that you really

180
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,940
you need to have support from your local IT support.

181
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,340
So then we suggest to basically lean back,

182
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,100
watch what's happening here,

183
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
figure things out with your local IT support later,

184
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,020
and then do the exercises after that.

185
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,620
We try to stay on schedule,

186
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,460
but sometimes things don't go as planned.

187
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,800
Things happen, cats visit, whatever.

188
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,260
And so it might be a little bit before or after time,

189
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,340
but in general, we try to stay on schedule

190
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,820
that we have published on our event page.

191
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,420
So you can follow along there.

192
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,320
It might be that the collaborative notes

193
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,100
are getting a little bit slow

194
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,420
or things are going in wrong places or something.

195
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,420
Usually that resolves itself after a moment,

196
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,060
often going into view mode

197
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,780
and then going back into edit mode helps with that.

198
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,620
But please also, well, yeah, it's hard to let us know

199
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,220
if it happens, but if it happens many, many times,

200
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,460
and in between you can write,

201
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,960
then use that in between to let us know about it.

202
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,060
We have some emergency backup things in place for that.

203
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,500
If the stream suddenly dies,

204
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,580
then probably [name]'s computer has given up

205
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,940
or electricity has gone down

206
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,940
or the cat unplugged the cable, or something like that.

207
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,860
Just stay around, and we will resume in about five minutes,

208
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,940
which is pretty fast to get things back up.

209
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,060
But we try our best.

210
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,260
So it might happen.

211
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,860
Don't panic.

212
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,620
And then for the exercises, we have sent out

213
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,260
installation instructions on installing and configuring

214
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:39,260
If you haven't done that, but still would like to follow the exercises, you can try that during the exercise sessions, or you just watch the stream and read through the things and do the exercises later.

215
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,260
I mentioned already that it's okay to not attend every day.

216
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:51,260
Everything will be available. There might be cats visiting instructors, just enjoy the show.

217
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:57,020
And if you want to know more about this course because you really like it, we will have a

218
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:03,100
workshop outro at the end of day six, where we'll give some hints on where you can go next.

219
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,460
And then just so you know, we have over 300 registered participants for this course, so also

220
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,180
the notes. There might really be happening quite a lot, and these are from over 20 different

221
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:24,380
countries and we have about 10 course coordinators, instructors and facilitators for this workshop

222
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:31,100
that are working hard in the background behind also the instructors to support you with your

223
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:37,740
learning by answering questions and keeping everything on track. And that also means we

224
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:47,740
We have people from all levels, from very programming beginners to advanced programmers

225
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,740
and then also many different backgrounds.

226
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,060
So please be respectful and helpful.

227
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,140
Anyone can answer any questions in the collaborative notes if you know the answer.

228
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,900
And sometimes it's actually good to have a few different opinions, a few different answers

229
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,020
in there as well.

230
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,340
We like to keep track of who is here.

231
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:14,380
So if you are watching the stream and you don't have access to the notes, for example,

232
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,680
and you haven't gotten any emails from us, then you probably haven't registered.

233
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,800
We would like you to do that so that we can keep track on who's here.

234
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,240
This will help us with future funding and so on.

235
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
And you will get access to the notes, which is also quite nice.

236
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,280
If you want certificates, we will mention this also in the outro, how you can get that

237
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,160
there is also a link on the workshop page for that.

238
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,680
We as a community

239
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:53,120
we hang out in our Zulip chat and you can find that link to that

240
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,320
on our website or also behind this link here. We have a lot of manuals

241
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,920
available if you want to run your own code refinery workshop or want to

242
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,000
get more involved or get to know what we're actually doing behind the scenes.

243
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:16,000
And we are on all like social media platforms on Mustard and Twitter and LinkedIn and if you like

244
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,600
this workshop or also not, share with your colleagues that you are here and what you

245
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,840
are learning. We are always happy to read the different views also. And now I'm already a

246
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,960
a little bit over time. I'm very sorry for that. I'll give over to [name] and [name] to start with

247
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,840
the introduction to version control and I'll add this also in the notes.

248
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,880
Thank you and have fun. Thanks for the intro. See you.

249
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:02,640
Yeah, thanks so much for this very nice intro. And hello, everybody. I'm not the one. Hello

250
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,440
from Northern Norway. Oh, it's isn't it cool that we have people joining from so many different

251
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,200
places. Some of these places make me really jealous to be to be at. So I'm not about working

252
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:24,160
the university in terms of doing teaching and support in research software engineering,

253
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:31,200
computing, programming. And I will be teaching today and tomorrow, and with me today is [name]

254
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:40,720
from Alpo. Yeah, I'm also basically a research software engineer and have been around here

255
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:50,000
quite a while so how do we start with um yeah motivation or yeah today we'll talk about
