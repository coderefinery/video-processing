6.1 Software Testing - CodeRefinery 2024 Sep

Software testing is a fundamental part of modern software development, and especially important for science since results should be correct.  Luckily, it's not so hard to get started, and anyone can do it. This is a crash course for scientists to get started testing their software.

Tools covered include concepts of testing for science, unit testing, pytest, continuous integration, and GitHub actions.  We make demos in Python, but have examples in other languages and this will apply to every language in some form.
