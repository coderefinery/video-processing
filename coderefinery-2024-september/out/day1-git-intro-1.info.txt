1.2 Git Intro (day 1) - CodeRefinery 2024 Sep

Here, we go over the basics of git from first principles, using the GitHub web interface.  First, we talk about basic motivation about why version control.  Then, we use the GitHub web interface to understand the basics of history, branches, commits, and merges, conflict resolution (online), and how everything fits together.  This isn't how normal work would happen, but it's a much easier starting point.  Part 2 (on day 2) goes to local work using all the same concepts we learned today.

Multi-user work and remotes is the next lesson, git-collaborative, on day 3.

There are two external videos which are excluded from this recording.  You can find the link to them in the table of contents below.
