1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
bit of intro and see how it adjusts and then we can check more later. So, welcome everyone

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:12,980
to day two. Hopefully you all are as excited to be here as we are. What's the plan for

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,940
day two. So today it's [name] and [name] teaching. So what do we have in store?

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,060
It will be more git. I'm just setting up so that I can also see what we are actually streaming.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,420
Are we now sharing the notes?

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,340
Yes, your screen is being shared.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,220
Good. Yeah. Yeah, so there will be there will be morgit. And we will today move

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,200
Both from from the web to our computers and from our computers to the web.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:53,300
So really the two goals are being able to take somebody else's project and continue

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,300
working on your computer.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Goal number one.

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,820
Goal number two is then be able to share your work with other people through places like

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,600
GitHub, GitLab.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,560
And in between, we will learn a really nice set of tools to navigate in a project created

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,880
by other people, because that's the situation we are often in.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:25,400
Yeah, so basically it's all about reaching, like someone said yesterday, connecting your

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:34,440
computer to the web, and then tomorrow is about using multiple people in projects.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah, tomorrow will be a collaboration.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,320
And I'm sharing here also two icebreaker questions.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,080
One of them is more just for fun, and this is so that you can,

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,920
we actually want to see that people are able to edit the document.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,120
So that's one thing we want to see.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,520
and if you are unsure how to find it and how to edit I will say something about that once we

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,280
officially start in a couple of minutes. But the second question is really important for us

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:14,280
and that is which path did you use yesterday to interact with Git? So please let us know

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,920
and I will come back to this question. So this is really important for us that you vote here

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,400
and that you also let us know about paths that we should offer in future.

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah, and maybe you can even help us add some of the extra paths after you've done the course.

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,680
Yeah, so what was your overall outlook of yesterday?

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:58,040
Um, I think it went pretty well from I was really happy with what we achieved a day.

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,920
The first day is always tricky because we have a lot of us who are completely new to

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
getting it up.

33
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,840
We have learners who use it since quite some time and the day one is to really find the

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,480
the balance of getting everybody on the same page

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,400
and get like an understanding of what Git is.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,080
And we try to find this balance

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,540
by offering these different paths,

38
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,400
like GitHub, like VS Code, like command line.

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
And we offer these different paths

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,520
because also we know that there is not this one tool

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,200
that will work for everybody.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,000
we want to meet learners where they are.

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
And also among ourselves,

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm sure that we use different tools.

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,920
And so, yeah, I was really happy with the progress.

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Yeah.

47
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
I guess the main thing I got from the feedback

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
is we should have clarified the different paths

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
going together.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,560
and made recommendations for which one to take.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
So yeah.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,240
And today we will do that because we need to do it.

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,400
So today I will spend a little bit of time at the beginning

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,720
to clarify that and also since today some of us might experiment with a different path

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,880
and we will show how

56
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,800
how you can set it up if you haven't done that already.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040
That's why also the first exercise will be a little bit longer to give people time to

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
set up and configure.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,440
I'll just rearrange my windows a little bit.

62
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Great.

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:02,160
So looking at the icebreakers here, what do we see?

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,920
of interesting animals there. The person who wrote Homo sapiens wins, especially if it

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,600
counts ourselves. That's probably actually what most of us should have said.

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,060
I saw a moose yesterday.

67
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Oh, nice.

68
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,580
I was driving in the dark and then it jumped over the road.

69
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
Okay.

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
Oh.

71
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Yeah.

72
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:44,020
Yeah, so I guess from the second question, it's about what we would have hoped and the

73
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,140
people who tried a combination of different paths,

74
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,460
that's actually good.

75
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,220
So I agree with what people said.

76
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,940
It's hard to do basically all the exercises twice

77
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,540
unless you're already really good at one of them.

78
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,620
But this is what we want people to be

79
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,860
able to see in the end, how these are actually

80
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,020
pretty similar going together, and they

81
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,180
can all do the same things.

82
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,100
and seeing what is the common thing there, but maybe we should also clarify that there was no

83
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,900
expectation that people now go through all the paths so that they choose one path. We can also

84
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:29,820
see that we will need something for our studio. The good news is that today I think we will have

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,780
some options for that. Do you have a preferred path you work through, [name]?

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,460
or are you using all all types so now for my own work yeah

87
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,140
for my own work it's most of the time it's command line

88
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,540
but if i can do something quick on the web i will do it quickly on the web

89
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:03,260
so it's command line and a little bit of github um yep have you tried this trick with

90
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:11,580
pressing the dot and then getting an editor on github yes that's a nice trick we should maybe

91
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:19,900
show that uh yeah we could have mentioned it later uh when we when we edit files yeah yeah

92
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:30,860
maybe let's remember to use it um then also today uh it will be possible to to do most of

93
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,660
today just with github but there is one portion that

94
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,820
for this we will need something to work locally but if if it doesn't work it's not a problem

95
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:51,580
you can then skip it and like 70 percent of today can be done in github alone okay

96
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,460
but i think we are ready to start three minutes past so maybe i'll head off and start watching the

97
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:08,700
questions again and leave you all to it yeah okay good great thanks a lot see

98
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,980
you later yep it's maybe it'll start by introducing ourselves and then I will

99
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,580
introduce this notes document that we are looking at on because that's an

100
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:25,700
important tool for us to so that you can interact and ask questions and give us

101
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:33,180
feedback. But first, yeah, hello here from Northern Norway. My name is [name], and

102
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,180
I've been doing these kind of workshops since many years and I really enjoy it. The rest

103
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:44,180
of my time I work with high performance computing and really supporting researchers and students

104
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:52,700
with everything around computing and programming. And with me is my colleague [name] from Tonheim.

105
00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:00,020
Yeah, good morning. My name is [name]. I work at the high performance group at the

106
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,620
Norwegian University of Technology and Science. So I've been part of cold refinery for quite

107
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:14,460
some years. And I like doing these workshops. So I'm really looking forward to today.

108
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,340
Yeah, so let's get started here first.

109
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:27,300
If you joined today, I just wanted to very briefly explain this document here that I'm

110
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,500
looking at.

111
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,960
And first of all, how do you find it?

112
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:40,700
You find it when you register to the workshop, you either got an email from me a couple of

113
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,540
days ago that contains the link.

114
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,940
If you registered after, it's also not a problem,

115
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,940
then it was in the automatic reply during your registration.

116
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,860
So there you can find the link to this document.

117
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,860
It's a document, it's like collaborative notes,

118
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,540
we can all view and edit.

119
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm now looking at it in the view mode,

120
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:15,240
but there is somewhere an edit button, edit pen, so if I click on the edit pen it switches

121
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:23,560
to edit mode and in the edit mode I can then edit and please try it so please try to to

122
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:33,000
add something for so I also saw some neighbor cat walking by so test it out

123
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,760
And then below here we have this other question that is really important for us and that is

124
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,880
which path did you choose yesterday to interact with git.

125
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,200
And it's not a problem if you were not here yesterday.

126
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,080
You should mention that we try to stay anonymous so we leave out your name so don't add your

127
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
name to the document.

128
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh great point yeah.

129
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,560
So here I don't use any names, but please ask lots of questions.

130
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,840
We will, after each day, we also publish the notes as part of the workshop.

131
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,640
So they become part of the workshop outcomes.

132
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,600
And I will scroll back to this question here, but below, you can then always find a link

133
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,160
to where we will be.

134
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:36,360
will now just post the link on where you can find today's material. So we will be very, very soon

135
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:53,800
starting here. Start today at here. And as we then go through different episodes, we post links to it.

136
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,080
it. And what we would really like you to do is to ask lots of questions. And the best

137
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,920
place to ask questions is at the bottom of the document, because we will hopefully get

138
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:12,520
I hope that we get at least 100 questions today. You can number the questions. I will

139
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:23,080
make an example here, for instance. Let's start with the question number one. Is this

140
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:34,920
the way, is this the place to ask? And somebody can answer. And somebody's answering. And

141
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,900
this is also why we are here, two instructors, plus we have our colleague in the studio,

142
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,700
so that we can, we are several people, we watch these questions. We will answer all

143
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:53,260
of them. And some of them we will then lift and we will discuss them in voice. So the

144
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,340
more questions, the better. And no question or too simple or too stupid

145
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,260
to ask. Ask anything about anything, really. Yeah. If you have a question is very likely

146
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,780
that somebody else has the same question and was too afraid to ask. So please ask it. Also

147
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,060
Also reminder, we use a code of conduct, so let's be all nice to each other.

148
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,920
This is like in any other professional setting.

149
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,860
And if you see something that is not right, please point it out.

150
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,460
We will also be...

151
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:33,560
We just want to create a really welcoming and nice atmosphere in this workshop.

152
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,660
But now that we got the housekeeping done, I will now navigate to this link.

153
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:48,060
can navigate that with me. So maybe the best way to participate today is to on one half of your

154
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:55,660
screen to have the nodes open. And this is also why our screen share is portrait mode and not

155
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:03,980
landscape mode. And on the other half of the screen you can then either have the GitHub open

156
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,460
or your editor, or your terminal.

157
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,500
And I will now navigate to the lesson material,

158
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,380
which, well, you can open somewhere else on your screen.
