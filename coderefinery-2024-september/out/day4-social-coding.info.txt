4.3 Social coding - CodeRefinery 2024 Sep

We don't just program for ourselves: we are part of a community. As scientists, we want to get citations, so how can our software support this?  Our work is a constant balance between using the work of others and hoping that others will use our work.  In this lesson, we talk about the advantages and disadvantages of others building on our work, and how to support that.

We cover best practices for software/data projects, requirements for sharing, copyright, licensing, citation, and more.
