1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
All right, so now it's 10 a.m. in Finland, let's start.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:14,580
I will first introduce you and then I will let you do the show.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,140
So let me switch to [name]' screen.

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,100
All right.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,580
Welcome, everyone, to the fourth episode

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,580
of this Code Refinery workshop, September 2024.

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,060
I'm [name], and I will be the host for you,

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,340
with you today.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,860
And today the topic is reproducibility,

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,100
specifically more kind of the computational reproducibility.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,340
So trying to replicate the results of other people

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,020
or even try to replicate what you did

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,460
a few months or a few years ago.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,940
The first part of today,

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,180
which will last for a couple of hours,

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,860
will be presented by [name].

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,900
[name], do you wanna say something about yourself?

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,420
a research software engineer at Aalto, which is the scientific computing group, same as [name]

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:23,620
essentially. And then [name] will be joined by [name]. [name], do you want to say something about

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:31,220
yourself? Hello, I'm [name]. I'm also a research software engineer at Aalto. So we are basically

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:39,540
all colleagues here now. Thanks. And then later after the lunch break, which will go from 12 to

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,740
one finish time. There will be [name] and I talking about social coding and licensing.

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,900
[name], do you want to introduce yourself?

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,580
Yeah, sure. I'm [name]. I'm also one of the RSEs at Alto. Happy to be here.

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,140
So it's a full Alto team this time, all based in Finland. So apologies if I will use the finish

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,260
time zone as a reference, but I guess you can convert it to your central European or wherever

27
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:17,620
you live. Just a reminder that the materials for today are linked in the main page of the workshop

28
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,180
and if you keep the notes document open we will also post the links to the materials that

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,660
the instructors are showing. This week compared to the first week is a week where we will not do

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,060
actual exercises. But of course there will be lots of questions for you and discussions. So in

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,060
practice the notes document is our main tool for interacting. We decided to do it like this for now

32
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,540
a couple of times. The reason being that sometimes all the material that are presented in the second

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,540
part of the week, in the second part of the workshop, it can be overwhelming to try to do

34
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,620
the exercises and also understand what's going on. So there are exercises written in the materials,

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,980
and of course you're welcome to try them later if you have time. But in general, try to follow

36
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,700
our demos and our discussion and try to contribute with lots of questions,

37
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,380
because that's the best that we can get out of this experience.

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,260
So I think, yeah. I'd like to add one thing here. One of the reasons that we don't do the exercises

39
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,580
also because some of the tools that we are showing this week are very specialized tools and not

40
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:42,660
actually useful for everything and going through the exercises if you think yeah think it's useful

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,140
for you yeah it's definitely a good idea but some of the tools can just be skipped

42
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,820
yes all right i think this is all for the introduction so i'm gonna leave the scene

43
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:03,460
and the screen to [name] and [name] and I'll be back later for the break.

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,260
Okay so yeah this week and particularly today is about reproducible research

45
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,620
and it essentially starts with getting files in order. You have already last week seen a lot about

46
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:30,980
version control. No, sorry. It's about how to code, what to use as names for your functions

47
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,580
and so on and this will be done. We'll mainly focus on tomorrow and on Thursday.

48
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:48,260
As mentioned earlier, documentation is a very important part of reproducible research because

49
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,780
without documentation it's very difficult to redo what others have done

50
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:00,580
and that will be covered extensively tomorrow. The last week you've already

51
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,380
had a version control of code of text and how to do that, how to do

52
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,620
collaborative and distributed version control and what are the challenges

53
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,460
there. You further have things like stabilizing your computing environment

54
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,780
so that others can more easily reproduce what you have done

55
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,460
because they know what your environment actually looked

56
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,140
like, and part of this is covered today.

57
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:36,580
And other ways to do this are shown in more detail

58
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,260
tomorrow and on Thursday.

59
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,660
And it's, of course, also about how you publish your research

60
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,340
outputs, how you publish your code, your data,

61
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,580
your documents that you need.

62
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,460
And social coding and open software

63
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,460
will also be discussed later today.
