CodeRefinery.org

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,060
you

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,060
you

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,060
you

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,060
you

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,060
you

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,060
you

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,060
you

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,060
you

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,060
you

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,060
you

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,060
you

14
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,060
you

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I believe we are live on stream now.

16
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,040
live on stream. Good morning everyone. Good morning [name], [name]. So excited to have you here.

17
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,360
Good morning. Good morning.

18
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:53,560
So completely different set of instructors for today and we're gonna go collaborative.

19
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,700
a little bit what we have done the first two days, but then also learned some new things

20
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:17,120
on how to work together with other people using version control.

21
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,920
So [name], what do you think the last two days, did you do well?

22
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,360
I think it was really good.

23
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,520
I have to say, I did not follow the teaching so much,

24
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,080
because I was following the notes mostly

25
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,760
and keep everything in check there.

26
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,320
But what I got from it was really nice.

27
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,280
So one thing, [name], is that when

28
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,240
you do this asynchronized teaching,

29
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
like we are doing it online and people follow us on Twitch

30
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,800
you know, different groups, different places.

31
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,100
Sometimes when we break for things, for example,

32
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,980
a real break, to have a break,

33
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,140
or maybe like we give some time for exercises,

34
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
you might not hear from us.

35
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,900
Right.

36
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,460
At some instance, we will try to communicate that

37
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,600
as much as possible.

38
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,100
But the best way is that you follow this shared document.

39
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,180
So you'll find the messages there.

40
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,420
So if you don't hear from us,

41
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,980
just have a look, maybe that we are in a break.

42
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,220
And we will also show it on stream

43
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,620
where there's information when we will be back.

44
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,060
And we'll also be asking how it's going

45
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,780
in the exercise sessions so that you can let us know

46
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,420
if you need more time or when you're done

47
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,580
or if you have major problems.

48
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,500
And if you say that you have major problems in the polls,

49
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,860
then please also let us know in the question section,

50
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,180
what it is you have major problems with because we are always updating our lesson material.

51
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:04,180
So we need to know what's going wrong to be able to adapt our instructions to it. And I think like

52
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,180
during the last, how many workshops did we have now? Are we like around 30, 40 or something like

53
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,980
this in total? Yeah, I'm a little hesitant to give a number because we have exact statistics,

54
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:26,340
so people can proof check it. It's a lot. It's a lot of workshops and a lot of iterations through

55
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:33,380
the lesson material. It is probably in many places completely different from how it started.

56
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,540
In some places maybe things stayed more the same because it just worked.

57
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,580
But yeah we rely on your feedback to do these improvements and we still have five minutes before

58
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,820
or we start with today's lesson.

59
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,780
So we are just randomly talking.

60
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,660
You don't have to listen yet, but you can, of course.

61
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,940
So how is the weather where you are today?

62
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,300
Yeah, I'm just looking out.

63
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,780
It is raining, but not that windy anymore.

64
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,100
Yesterday, we had quite windy weather here

65
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,140
in Lohja in Finland.

66
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,100
How about where you are?

67
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,980
So we are in Oslo.

68
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,580
We had last week suddenly summer again.

69
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,300
And now it's again kind of rainy, cold weather.

70
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,420
It feels like Bergen here at the moment.

71
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,900
So [name] might feel very home, the weather we are in now.

72
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,060
And now surprise, surprise.

73
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,900
[name], how is the weather in Bergen?

74
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,660
It's Bergen weather, I would say.

75
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,820
OK.

76
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,300
We had some sunny days last week,

77
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,700
but just now it seems like back to bargain weather.

78
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,540
It's raining.

79
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,080
Seems like many are sharing that today.

80
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,900
So I think it's good weather to learn some Git.

81
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,420
Yes, it's the perfect weather.

82
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,700
Nothing that drags you outside really.

83
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,940
I think we have three more minutes.

84
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,140
So yesterday, [name], I saw that some of our learners,

85
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,700
they were actually sharing their knowledge,

86
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
you're answering questions.

87
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,460
So Radwan also mentioned this,

88
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,940
which is very encouraging that, you know,

89
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,900
if you know more about certain things,

90
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,940
it's okay to share your knowledge.

91
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,740
And do you recommend that if somebody,

92
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,900
let's say if you want to contribute,

93
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,620
they want to, they should mention,

94
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,460
maybe they are one of the learners,

95
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,860
Is that necessary to mention that in the answer or maybe we'll check it anyway.

96
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,260
It's not necessary but you can mention it that answer from another learner or something like

97
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:56,300
this and on some questions there's also it's a matter of taste a matter of like own feelings

98
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,180
so it's actually nice to have multiple answers not only one from us but maybe there is someone

99
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,180
else who has experienced something else or can contribute some experiences with I don't know

100
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,020
know, a certain tool or whatever is asked.

101
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,420
So yeah, we encourage everyone to also answer questions

102
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,580
or provide links to cool stuff that somehow relates

103
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,560
to the question or something.

104
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,700
We have a few people here behind the scenes

105
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,560
working on answering the question,

106
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,280
but yeah, all help is welcome.

107
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,100
Yeah, that's really true.

108
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,140
So we have, yes, yes, we are like teaching,

109
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,500
we kind of have this this pedagogical aspects of like core teaching and then like peer assisted

110
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,340
learning they call it which means like as an instructor while preparing for this and also

111
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,540
answering questions and during the lessons and from the answers I also learn some sometimes

112
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:00,500
no I mean most of the time I learn something. Yeah me too like every workshop I've participated

113
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,660
now. There was always something new even though materials were pretty similar. People teach it

114
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,100
in different ways and then there's a participant answering question or new people answering

115
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,740
questions. So there's always something new to learn. Okay we have one minute to go. Welcome

116
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:28,900
everyone who's joining us right now. We will be starting in a minute with a short introduction

117
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:40,580
to the collaborative notes and then we'll go dive right into the collaborative version control

118
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,260
or is it collaborative and distributed version control, right? That was the title. Yes.

119
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,760
Okay.

120
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,500
Is the audio good? Can maybe someone

121
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,380
in our internal chat. Let us know if the audio levels are

122
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,860
leveled. We did not do our normal test this morning. Audio good, I see. Okay, great.

123
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:21,220
And at my clock, at least it is now 10 a.m. in the morning in Finland.

124
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:28,900
So welcome everyone to this third day already of the Code Refinery Workshop,

125
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,340
Autumn Code Refinery Workshop this year. We are here with [name] and [name] who will be guiding

126
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,260
you through the lesson today and my name is [name]. I'm the Community Manager of the Code

127
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:49,060
Refinery Project and I will just for a few minutes guide you again through the collaborative notes

128
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:58,420
document that you can see here shared. You should have all gotten the link to this after

129
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,740
registering for this workshop via email. It's this notes.coderefinery.org

130
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:14,500
link and this is our main communication channel with you where you can ask questions, where we

131
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,420
will put links to the materials that are shown here on stream where we'll tell you about breaks

132
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:28,820
and exercise sessions and you can find here in the top a few links first to the stream that's

133
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,020
what you probably already have found then we also follow a code of conduct which you can find behind

134
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,100
this link and there's then also a link to the form if you encounter something that violates

135
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:50,820
the Code of Conduct. There is a few information here also about how to set up your own laptop

136
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,780
screen, especially if you only have a small screen. Just a suggestion from us that we

137
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,820
have learned to work quite well for learners. You can of course do whatever feels right. There's

138
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:10,340
also a link to our schedule where you can find all the different lesson materials also from the

139
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:16,980
previous days and the upcoming days and this is also the place where we collect the collaborative

140
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,140
notes from the previous days where you can go back and check if you had some question there and did

141
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:32,100
not check out the answer yet for example and yeah so here's also the link directly to the archives

142
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,500
There was a few preparations for today and I'll ask [name] and [name] in a moment about those.

143
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:46,260
But let's first go here to our icebreaker. So I'm now currently in view mode of our document and

144
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,980
we can see already that some have already found the edit mode so let's do that as well.

145
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,500
So for that I have to go a little bit up for this little pen symbol to appear here. For me it's up

146
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,020
here on the right it might be if you have a little bit wider window up here on the left somewhere

147
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:10,500
but it's always a pen symbol. That brings us into edit mode and then we can scroll here to

148
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,660
the icebreaker and first we have the one about if you can ask for any superpowers what would

149
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,980
you ask for and someone has already put fly and I add my plus one here I would also like to

150
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:31,460
fly and you can add more here in the bottom and you can see that sometimes someone is writing and

151
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,700
then you might have to wait a moment or like go below that or go to a different

152
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:45,460
row to not overwrite each other. And then in preparation for today there was this list of

153
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:53,540
preparations that [name] sent via email day before yesterday and this morning.

154
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:05,540
So we would like to ask you if you have done that, so that we can know like in how much detail we need to go through these things again.

155
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:13,540
And then you can also find some questions from yesterday here that we will also make sure to answer if we haven't yet.

156
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,540
And in the bottom, you can then later add your questions for today's session.

157
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:26,540
So let's get started and maybe the first question to you, [name] and Danijais,

158
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,540
would you like to introduce yourself?

159
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,540
Yes, [name], thank you very much for a very enthusiastic start.

160
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,540
And you will explain how to edit this document.

161
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,540
So my name is [name], I'm joining from Oslo.

162
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:48,540
So I mainly work with the Norwegian AI cloud and also the NRIS supercomputers.

163
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:55,660
I use git a lot every day, so I would like to share some of my knowledge and learn more things

164
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:02,620
with you today. Yeah, welcome to everybody. Thank you [name] and thank you [name] for a

165
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:09,260
nice introduction and welcome everyone. My name is [name]. I'm from University of Bergen.

166
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:15,340
I'm part of the scientific computing group here and just like [name], we collaborate at

167
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,500
at an organization called NRIS.

168
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,300
Mostly I do training, run training activities at NRIS

169
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,140
and I'm also using it every day,

170
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,400
but each day, like this kind of training,

171
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
something is new I'm learning.

172
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,920
So I'm also going, excited to learn a little bit more

173
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,700
from the others.

174
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,260
So please feel free to ask questions

175
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,780
And if we don't know, you can answer it,

176
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,500
as [name] and [name] mentioned.

177
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,660
And I'm so excited and looking forward

178
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,740
to the next couple of hours.

179
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,360
Thank you.

180
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,540
Awesome.

181
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,580
And then the big question, what was

182
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,060
the preparations for day three?

183
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,260
So what should people do or have done already

184
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,300
to be able to do the exercises with you today?

185
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,660
So [name], the details are here in the email

186
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,380
and also in the HackMD.

187
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,340
I could just show the repository

188
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,740
that you should have send the issues.

189
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,420
Can I take the screen from you?

190
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,380
Yes, please take the screen.

191
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,120
And I'll say bye here and have fun.

192
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,940
I'll be in the notes.

193
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,780
Thank you.

194
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,020
So from the notes that [name] was very kind to explain

195
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,100
that [name] was very kind to explain.

196
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,380
There's this link access request report which is also very well explained in the email

197
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,460
and there are links. So you should go to this report

198
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,940
and open a new issue. So what you should say is that

199
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,020
please add me as a collaborator. That's the only thing we need.

200
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,860
The reason that we are going to do is to get your username. So once you get the

201
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,460
username,

202
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,340
so we are going to work as a team or

203
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,260
have this feeling that if you are in a

204
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,100
team or that you want to contribute to

205
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,860
something that you don't have access.

206
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,540
So please open an issue if you have not

207
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,940
opened it yet and our Code Refinery

208
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
colleagues because I'm not I'm going to

209
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,740
to now switch my tab.

210
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,340
I might not see the issues.

211
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,260
So I'll be very grateful if you could help me

212
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,620
to add new people if they come.

213
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,460
Does that explain, [name]?

214
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
Yes, so one thing I want to add is

215
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,540
if you are working as a team, that you don't need

216
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,620
to send an access request here.

217
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,900
So there you will be working with your team

218
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,500
and your team leader will create a repository for you to work.

219
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,420
that's if you're an individual learner this is what you would we would like you to do

220
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:17,980
to participate in the collaborative exercise okay then maybe in the notes our colleagues could help

221
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,980
include that task for the voting as well like if there isn't a team i'm in the background here and

222
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,940
and accepting requests.

223
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,900
Thank you very much.

224
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,060
Thanks, [name].

225
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,500
And then from the collaborative document

226
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,660
or from the Code Refinery website,

227
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,260
you have today's course, the September course.

228
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,980
And we are already done with day one and two.

229
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,420
We really hope you got some new knowledge from this

230
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,980
and enjoyed what you learned.

231
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,540
So we are in day three.

232
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,220
So I'm in this collaborative distributed virtual control

233
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,780
first part, one of two.

234
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,500
So that is where I am here.

235
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,820
So on the first page, we are summarizing some introductions

236
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,780
and summaries about the things we are going to learn.

237
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,780
And on the menu side, you could jump into different sections.

238
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,020
But what I'm going to do is click the Next button

239
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,860
to start the new lesson.

240
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,500
So the concept around collaboration.

241
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
So what are the motivation?

242
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,940
Why do we need to learn this?

243
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,140
So as mentioned here, someone has given you

244
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,420
access to a repository online, and you want to contribute.

245
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,540
Let's say the Code Refinery website.

246
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,740
It's also in Git.

247
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,140
And myself, and [name], and [name], and [name],

248
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,980
and everybody, they were invited to contribute.

249
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,780
So we became contributors in that.

250
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,380
But it might be not that it's not you who created it.

251
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,980
It's somebody who created, maybe it's an organization created,

252
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,940
and you've been invited.

253
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,860
And we'll learn how to make copies of repositories.

254
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,340
So let's say there are so many instances that you

255
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,300
might want to have a copy.

256
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,300
So let's say if you're working on your laptop

257
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,560
or your local computer and you want to modify the code,

258
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,320
then you have to get it down to your computer.

259
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,760
That one example. There are other examples that we talk a little later.

260
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,420
Then [name], this Git as a technology,

261
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,160
there are different companies are involved.

262
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,700
For example, the GitHub,

263
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
you have the GitLab, there was GitBucket,

264
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,500
and so many other smaller companies.

265
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,340
And also, you could have this Git hosted on your institute.

266
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,780
For example, in University of Oslo,

267
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,700
we have our own Git, which is github.uio.no.

268
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,540
In our entries organization that we work,

269
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,220
we have gitlab.sigma2.no.

270
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,420
So there are different places.

271
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,180
So because of these different companies,

272
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,780
you might find slight variations of the terminology.

273
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,580
For example, we will be using the word pool request.

274
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,100
another company might, GitLab would use merge request. So pool merge, we might switch between

275
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:30,460
these terms when we move between companies, but because we are mostly following up in GitHub,

276
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:40,540
we will use GitHub terminology more in this lesson. So once we know how to contribute,

277
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,140
We will be going through a concept called code review.

278
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,940
So this is to make sure that something that, for example,

279
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,300
I want to contribute something, but I unknowingly

280
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,740
broke something.

281
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,840
And then we don't want to go that into production.

282
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,980
There should be some other people just having a look.

283
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,180
For example, [name], in newspapers,

284
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,300
people publish a lot of articles.

285
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,780
So this has got to an editor.

286
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,860
and there's some proof-checking going on.

287
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,700
So it's something like that, but it's

288
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:22,380
more a peer-assisted process, like you

289
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,500
have your co-developers, or maybe a supervisor is doing

290
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,740
that, or maybe one of your peers doing that.

291
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,820
So we'll talk about that as well.

292
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,540
Does that cover the things that you're going to do,

293
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,180
the reason for learning Git collaboration today, [name]?

294
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,740
Or do you have anything else to add?

295
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,940
Yeah, you covered most of it. Thanks. And I just want to mention all these workflows.

296
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,980
You mentioned about GitLab, BigBucket, and GitHub, everything, and there are slight variations in

297
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:58,780
the terminology, but the workflow is same for all this version control cloud in web interfaces. So

298
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:06,780
when you learn Git, today we are going to discuss on GitHub web interface, but the workflow you are

299
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,220
learning would be applicable to other.

300
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,500
If your university, if your organization having a GitLab,

301
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,740
then you can implement all you learned today on that as well.

302
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,300
So there is not much changes, slight variation

303
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
in the terminology.

304
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,380
That's what I want to mention.

305
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,460
That's a great point.

306
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,700
Like, if you know the core concepts,

307
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,020
you can apply it across different companies.

308
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,580
And I will try to explain a little bit about the terms,

309
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,580
[name], so you have to help me that I don't go over time.

310
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,700
Because the main focus of this lesson

311
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,220
is for you to practice, so the learners to practice.

312
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,220
And this lesson is redesigned, actually.

313
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,500
I think it has matured very well since we started.

314
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,020
That learn by doing, and then we discuss.

315
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,300
So it's not about me talking a lot,

316
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,700
but we tell you, inform you the things you need to know.

317
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,980
And then you have to learn a bit more by yourself.

318
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,220
So please help me to keep track of my time

319
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,020
because these two could go into tangents

320
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,820
and we could discuss so many things.

321
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,280
Now we are in the third day.

322
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,980
So if you had followed the course already up to now

323
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,780
or you're just joining today,

324
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,220
you know a little bit quick.

325
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,220
The concept that we're gonna talk,

326
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,980
We expect you to know a little bit of Git by this time,

327
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,180
which means that you have followed the course last two days or you are joining today,

328
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,740
but you have some knowledge.

329
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,620
So a repository.

330
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,460
So when you mean a repository,

331
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,220
it means it contains all the data,

332
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,540
the history, the commits that you might now remember what a commit is,

333
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,580
the branches, everything included.

334
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,020
This is the complete package.

335
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:04,620
Then a commit would be that the snapshots you saved with a message that you remember that

336
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:16,220
hash is included to sort of unambiguously identify the commit. And then you could tag it,

337
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:24,220
you could give some label or like some placeholder that you can find later.

338
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,740
And then other terms that we might focus more,

339
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,780
cloning and forking.

340
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,740
So these terms, I don't think memorizing

341
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,100
would help these terms.

342
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,860
But when you work, you get it naturally,

343
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,180
get into your muscle memory, what these things are

344
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,780
and how you do things.

345
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,020
So I'm not going to spend too much time

346
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,740
on describing each term.

347
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,420
And also, [name] with Git, what I found out

348
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,980
is that rather than learning what is a commit is,

349
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,020
learning the overall process and find out

350
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,460
where a commit fits helps me to understand better.

351
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,060
For example, now we're going to talk

352
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,780
cloning and forking and using templates

353
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,740
and copying repositories.

354
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,980
All this we will try to kind of learn together,

355
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,180
but there are different concepts.

356
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,820
So there are many ways to get a copy.

357
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,100
So one way is to get a clone.

358
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,380
So that is how you work specifically

359
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,220
when you want to get a copy of something

360
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,100
to your local computer.

361
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,060
I could give you two examples.

362
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,980
One is that I want to get some code from computer code

363
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:47,420
from somebody who is hosting on the web on GitHub.

364
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,780
And then I want to do some modifications.

365
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,820
And I want to maybe contribute back.

366
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,460
or maybe for my use, I need to do some modification,

367
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,660
then I need to get this code to my computer.

368
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,780
When I want to, when we're preparing for this lesson,

369
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,540
when we want to modify some text on CodeRefiner website,

370
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,340
I made a clone of the CodeRefiner website to my laptop.

371
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,220
I made the change, and I send it back requesting,

372
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,700
can you please incorporate this?

373
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,980
you could do the same thing in the cloud,

374
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,820
which means that without cloning to your laptop,

375
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,620
you could clone it inside GitHub itself

376
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,180
and have the copy in the cloud.

377
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,740
So the way I kind of understand the difference

378
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,100
between a clone and a fork that we'll talk next

379
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,180
is that the clone is in your computer,

380
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,180
but if the clone is in the GitHub itself,

381
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,740
it's we call it fork.

382
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,180
So when you have it on your local computer,

383
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,780
there's total disconnect while you work,

384
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:01,100
unless you explicitly take measures to synchronize it.

385
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,340
But in a fork, because it's inside GitHub,

386
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,540
these repositories somehow have some knowledge of each other.

387
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:13,060
So you could, like, if the upstream, which

388
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,900
means where we copied the repository from,

389
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,500
If there's an update, it could inform,

390
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,500
GitHub inform that it has happened.

391
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,460
And in addition, issues.

392
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,740
So when we talk about issues a little later on,

393
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,980
these issues could be referenced from your fork.

394
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,260
So there is some kind of a connection

395
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,020
because it's in the same place, same cloud.

396
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,140
There's more connection between the copy

397
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,340
that we make in the cloud

398
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,420
than the copy we have in our laptop.

399
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,820
Does that make sense, Daryan?

400
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:52,620
Yes, I just want to mention I will clone some repository if there is some program I want

401
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,820
to just run.

402
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
It's my data.

403
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,620
So I sometimes I won't contribute back.

404
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,180
I just want to have that program with if that's a library or public repository, I will clone

405
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:10,540
it and do my work myself with this different data maybe.

406
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
That's a very good point.

407
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,420
we want your software, let's say if you want to compile it, compile software on our systems,

408
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,860
we clone it. And that is a very good example of a clone. Yes.

409
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:32,740
And then when you want to create a repository, but you don't want everything, but you want to

410
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:38,420
create something that looks like something else. So these folks and clones, they could

411
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,960
they could make entire copies.

412
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,640
But don't worry too much,

413
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,400
but if you know a little bit Git,

414
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,640
I would also like to mention something

415
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,940
that you could actually explicitly define

416
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,640
how deep the copy is.

417
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,280
For example, you don't have to copy all the branches.

418
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
You don't have to copy all the comments.

419
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,160
So I'm just trying to place some commands

420
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,880
in the HCI documents later on.

421
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,920
You have commands like depth.

422
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
No, you could define, even in forking and cloning,

423
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,280
you could also define how much of,

424
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,580
how much, how deep you want the copy to be.

425
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,600
But when you don't want to like explicitly mention that,

426
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,280
you could use something like a template,

427
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,880
which means the example given here is the cookie cutter.

428
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,640
So what is a cookie cutter, [name]?

429
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,840
I tried to have the same shapes of the cookies,

430
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,680
I would say.

431
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,280
Like I can make cookies without cookie cutter,

432
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,760
but if I want the same kind of pattern in my cookies,

433
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,680
I will use this cookie cutter.

434
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,420
So I will get the same shapes.

435
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,840
Okay, so what does this mean in Git world?

436
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Git world, you take a similar kind of pattern

437
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,080
in your repository.

438
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,040
if you're taking from a template,

439
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,360
you get the repository, you take a template,

440
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,520
it will be similar, but the history will be flattened.

441
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,280
That's what I would say.

442
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,960
But I think we will go through this.

443
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,160
If you are working with a team,

444
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,040
you will take a template from our CR

445
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,120
collaborative workshop repository.

446
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Yeah.

447
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:44,120
So we will have it in our exercise, but there is one question about question number six.

448
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
You want to take it?

449
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,480
Maybe we will come back to it when we have the exercise, but do you want to mention it

450
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
[name]?

451
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
What was that, Dhani?

452
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,520
Because I want to finish it in four or five minutes now, but if you can read me the question,

453
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,960
we could see what it is.

454
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,360
Yeah, how to push us to local fork compared to synchronizing to the upstream source where

455
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,000
you fork from? Is there a way to commit and push to the place one forked from?

456
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,000
So a good question, very good question. And it has become much easier to do that now,

457
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,880
but we will demonstrate that later. And then I would say that as a question you could ask,

458
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,640
if you don't know, maybe one of our instructors, our colleagues could ask as well.

459
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,920
There's a command called squash, so that command we need to, it's good to understand when we

460
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,880
talk about templates, the command called squash, we could discuss a little bit in the

461
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,440
HackMD. So here we get a copy. What if, [name], let's say we talked about different companies.

462
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,800
You have something in GitHub, but you want to transfer it to GitLab. And you said in the

463
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,600
morning that if you learn the concept, it's easier to move between these things.

464
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,120
Is it possible to move something from GitHub to GitLab?

465
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,400
I assume so, yes.

466
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,520
Yes, yeah.

467
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,360
So for that, you could use commands like import.

468
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,840
So it's possible to import a GitHub repository to GitLab.

469
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,680
But there might be functionalities

470
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,640
that will not be fully copied.

471
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,040
And things which are metadata, like issue connections,

472
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,800
that might get not copied, but they could also synchronize.

473
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Because, [name], as we said in the morning,

474
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,720
our main attempt today is to learn by doing.

475
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,360
So what we'll do is we go to an exercise.

476
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,480
Would you be kind enough to maybe take my screen

477
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,720
and explain what we are planning to do

478
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,680
and the timing, and a little bit about the exercises.

479
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,320
Yes, I will try to take over the screen.

480
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,880
Yeah, my screen looks OK.

481
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,280
So I had to stop my sharing now to [name].

482
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
Is it safe for me to stop the sharing?

483
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,440
Can [name] just take it over without you stopping?

484
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,080
I am sharing from my side.

485
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Can you?

486
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Okay.

487
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Then maybe Sarpreet should stop.

488
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Zoom changed.

489
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Yeah.

490
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Okay.

491
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
There it goes.

492
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Yeah.

493
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
Okay.

494
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Yeah.

495
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,360
So, we are going to prepare for the exercise, but you have had a lot of them in the last

496
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,840
15 minutes, commit branches, pull request,

497
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,320
or merge request, template and everything.

498
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,160
Don't worry, don't get overwhelmed.

499
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,480
And we are going to really do the hands-on

500
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,520
and then we get the practice.

501
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,160
So now what we are going to do is

502
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,600
we are going to collaborate.

503
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Last two days, you did your own repository examples

504
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,340
and you try to fork or clone.

505
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,460
So today is as a team,

506
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,000
we are collaborating on this code refinery workshop,

507
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,160
collaborative workshop repository.

508
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,140
So if you are,

509
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,180
there are two ways to participate in this exercise.

510
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,140
One as a team,

511
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,000
and you, I assume you are in an exercise room.

512
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,840
And if you have a team member, team leader, that's great.

513
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,120
if not, assign someone as the team leader

514
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,960
so that they can create a template for you to collaborate.

515
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,560
So what we are going to do is,

516
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,000
if you are in a team or an individual learner,

517
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,580
we will contribute to a repository via a pull request

518
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,880
that [name] mentioned.

519
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,280
Pull request, I would say,

520
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,720
is the way to communicate between,

521
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,980
pull and push are some words I would use to communicate,

522
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,980
and pull request is suggest changes.

523
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,620
And someone, as [name] mentioned,

524
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,380
someone will review it and accept it

525
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,780
so that your changes are there in the repository.

526
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,620
That's what we are going to do that.

527
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,540
So if you are in a group, if you have a team leader,

528
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,700
there are some work for the team leader to do

529
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,100
is only one person.

530
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,900
If you don't have a team leader assigned,

531
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,540
one person can take the role and create a template from here.

532
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,220
We have these screenshots here, and you

533
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,100
can create the template, use the template,

534
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,100
and then add everyone in your group in that repository.

535
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,180
So you will have a repository under when

536
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,500
you create a template from this repository,

537
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,940
you will have one repository under your namespace

538
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,380
as a team leader.

539
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,780
Then what you have to do is other team members

540
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,420
have to give their username to the team leader

541
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,780
and the team leader should give access

542
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,980
to your team members to the repository

543
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,980
and then you will be able to contribute.

544
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,940
So that's one preparation as a team leader you have to do.

545
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,980
And I will come back to you about a little bit more

546
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:45,300
it, but please create a template first. Then we have many individual learners. We are here.

547
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,460
What you are going to do is you are collaborating with us. So, we are a collaborator, and there

548
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:58,340
are two repositories. One is not recorded and recorded. Recorded is what we will show

549
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:07,020
on the stream, and if you don't want to show your usernames and things on stream, you use

550
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,660
the not recorded one, and the recorded one is for those we will show on the stream.

551
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,220
But the first thing is you have to have access to this repository.

552
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,100
That's what we were mentioning in the beginning, that please ask for access, and we will give

553
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
you access.

554
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:30,740
you are the team member of this repository, and you can collaborate. That's what, as an individual

555
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:36,980
learner, if you want to do this exercise, you have to do, if you already haven't done it.

556
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:49,380
So, yeah, if you did that, when you accept, you will get an email notification, and on this

557
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:56,180
this same email you have GitHub know about your username.

558
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,140
So you will need to accept it.

559
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,420
Then only you become part of the collaborative repository.

560
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,940
So just send an access request.

561
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,380
Then you get an email notification.

562
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,420
You have to accept it.

563
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,420
And there was something more.

564
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,900
It's both for the team leaders, teams,

565
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,900
and also for the individual learners,

566
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,060
that you are supposed to watch this.

567
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,260
If I can go to my GitHub and you see that

568
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,700
there is an eye icon with watch,

569
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,740
you can click on the participating and mentioning.

570
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,300
Otherwise, if you have it as all activities,

571
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,340
there will be more emails coming to you.

572
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:54,460
It might be overwhelming for you and I, do you think that is a good idea to have an all

573
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
activity?

574
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,460
[name]?

575
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Yeah.

576
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:04,980
So the, because we, because there might be a lot of learners, we are doing a lot of,

577
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,560
many people are joining at the same time, there might be overwhelming.

578
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,180
So what you recommended is better.

579
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,180
Yeah.

580
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,060
So that you can do as a team lead,

581
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,540
also you can mentioning the participating and mention

582
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,300
that then you will get notified when there is an activity

583
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,740
on that you are involved in,

584
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,940
or someone mentioned you on one of the issues

585
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,580
or pull request or something.

586
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,580
So we expect that you take only the participating

587
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,880
and mentions.

588
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,420
Otherwise, it's not a problem, but you will get a lot of notification.

589
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,580
That's why this is recommended.

590
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,760
So these are the setup we are expecting for you to check before that.

591
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,080
But when you are added, I wanted to give you some information about the

592
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,740
background, what we are going to do about it, this is the recorded repository

593
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,980
that we are going to show you on screen.

594
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:17,780
So, if you go to the settings option, there is collaborators and teams.

595
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:24,740
Stream exercise participant is where we add all of you who request access to this repository.

596
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,620
And I will change the role, the default role is read.

597
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,620
So we will...

598
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,220
So, [name], before you go, you show that settings menu how to come in.

599
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,260
So if you are working on a smaller screen,

600
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,380
this might be hidden.

601
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,100
So you might have to zoom out or zoom in.

602
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,620
Sometimes the menus could be hidden, but those are there.

603
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,740
Yes, yeah.

604
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,820
Good point, [name].

605
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,460
That's one reason I am a bit zoomed out,

606
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,980
because I wanted to show the settings part.

607
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,540
So the default role is read, but we

608
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,460
wanted everyone to collaborate, all these members

609
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,820
and the stream exercise participants.

610
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,820
We have 44 members now.

611
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,020
So if you haven't done it yet, you can give it.

612
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,140
This is something the team leaders also should do.

613
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,980
When they accept members, they have

614
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,340
to give the right access to those members.

615
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,180
So go to Settings and Collaborates and Teams.

616
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,980
Then you find your members and give right access.

617
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,140
It's default, it will be read access.

618
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:43,140
And the other point is you have to protect your main branch.

619
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,700
So you have to create a rule for your,

620
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,700
we already create one rule for our main branch.

621
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,660
You can edit it.

622
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:58,700
And what it means is you cannot forcefully push changes to it.

623
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,460
you have to have a pull request before merging it

624
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,540
to the repository so that the maintainers or other people

625
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,860
can review the changes and approve it and then merge it.

626
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:17,420
So otherwise, if main branch is not protected,

627
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,900
anyone can push changes directly to the main branches.

628
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,660
That's not a good workflow when you collaborate together.

629
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,340
Anything you want to add, [name]?

630
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,860
Yeah, you explain it very well.

631
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:34,780
So the main branch or the master branch, sometimes it's called.

632
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,220
Or in some companies, they have this production branch,

633
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,740
where the actual product goes out.

634
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,740
So there are some branches that are protected.

635
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,660
People can't, without anybody else knowing,

636
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,140
just make a modification.

637
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,980
So when you protect it, other people

638
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:01,540
must be made aware in order to have this accepted and integrated. So it's become like a

639
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:09,620
team awareness protocol rather than kind of policing things. It's not like making

640
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:15,380
things difficult, but it is to make sure that all changes go through some review process.

641
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:23,380
Yeah, good. We have already done this for you, those who are individual learners

642
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:30,860
and participating with us. But the team members, if you're working with a team, the team leader

643
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:39,060
is expected to do this on their repository. So we are working on this workflow exercise

644
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:45,660
recorded version on stream. The individual learners, they don't need to do anything.

645
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:51,060
We already have done it. But if you're working with a team, the team leader or the responsible

646
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:59,140
person who would create the template from the CodeRefinery repository. You are expected to

647
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:08,500
protect your main branch and also give right access to your collaborators. Yeah. So I think

648
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:15,460
we have the setup mentioned, and then after you have done this setup, that's what we are going

649
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,460
to do is we are going to collaborate. We have all these terms explained, but you can find,

650
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:28,580
if you create the commit locally, how to do that, and everything is linked in the exercise part. So,

651
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:36,100
if you don't remember things, that's okay. You can go back and see. But what we expected you to

652
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:45,140
do during this exercise is that you open an issue where you describe the changes you want

653
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:53,220
to make, for example, on this for the individual learners, you can create an issue here and

654
00:50:53,940 --> 00:51:00,660
then create a new branch from there and make changes in your branch, commit there and push

655
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:06,420
your new branch to the repository you are working on. So, [name], when you said issue,

656
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,300
you explained this. I'm just trying to iterate it just to make sure people understand it.

657
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,700
people could work on three places now, isn't it?

658
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,140
So they could work on our centralized workflow

659
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,940
recorded, where their names will be visible.

660
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,020
And then they could work on centralized workflow not

661
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,460
recorded version, where they'll not be shown in our videos.

662
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,300
Or they will work on the repository

663
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,900
their team leader creates.

664
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,420
So they have to select where they work,

665
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,220
and then the issue should be created in that location.

666
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,020
Is that correct?

667
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,260
Yes.

668
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,300
So yeah, for those individual learners,

669
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,980
you create an issue on this workshop exercise

670
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,180
recorded or non-recorded according to your preferences.

671
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,300
And this is what you want to change.

672
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,580
And then create a branch, make the changes,

673
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:03,020
and push your new branch to the repository you are working on.

674
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,180
Then open a pull request after pushing your branch.

675
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:14,140
Then you can see somebody else pull request there.

676
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,380
You can review it if you have enough time.

677
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,300
And then we will come back, and we will review it together here

678
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,340
as well on the stream.

679
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,420
At least we expected to do that until step five.

680
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,940
OK, so when you create a branch, [name],

681
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,980
there could be different ways to do that as well.

682
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,940
Maybe people can do it in the GitHub itself.

683
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,980
They could use VS Code.

684
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,300
They could clone it and create a branch.

685
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,020
So there could be multiple workflows people follow.

686
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,660
So there's no exactly one way to achieve this.

687
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,580
But the concept that we are going to learn

688
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,700
is to open the issue and make your changes in the branch,

689
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,140
not in the main branch.

690
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,180
Because now the main branch is actually so protected.

691
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,500
So wherever that you are going to work,

692
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,580
on the terminal, on the web, on ID,

693
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,380
like integrated development environment

694
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,180
like some other program, you could

695
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,060
follow this, the same things.

696
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,500
And maybe, [name], it's better to create a new file,

697
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,500
I mean like a new recipe, than editing an existing file

698
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,940
because multiple people might edit it.

699
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,300
So that's a good concept to learn

700
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,460
if you know a little bit Git.

701
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,060
But in order to learn today's concepts about contributing,

702
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:41,340
and maybe we could try to avoid little bit complications

703
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,300
like conflicts, for example, which is OK to happen.

704
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,620
Those are good concepts in Git.

705
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,020
But while we learn the basics, it's

706
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,460
better to maybe create a new file.

707
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,620
What do you think?

708
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,340
Yeah.

709
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:02,180
But I really like if someone changes something also.

710
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,660
but that's a good thing if you want to review

711
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,340
and add a new file is a good thing.

712
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,340
But in reality, you will have sometimes some conflict,

713
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,180
but the best part is if you create an issue

714
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,900
and you describe the changes you want to make,

715
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,900
and if you're working on it, assign it to yourself.

716
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,820
So then the other people know that you're working on it.

717
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,660
So mention it, but we will come back to it,

718
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,140
how to show it after the exercise.

719
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:36,140
But now we expect at least until step five

720
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,980
in the next 20 minutes.

721
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,260
What do you think [name]?

722
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,300
We will give it 20 minutes to exercise time.

723
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,420
Yes, 20 minutes and we'll have like a poll.

724
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,300
If you want five minutes more, it's okay to take it.

725
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,420
But in the shared document,

726
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,260
we will ask whether you are finished or not.

727
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,340
If many people want more time, it's okay.

728
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,420
We can be a little flexible

729
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,420
because exercise are the most important thing.

730
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,260
We'll do that.

731
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:03,460
And [name], one thing is now we're going to break for exercise, which means that we're

732
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:08,820
going to stop talking and the learner is supposed to do the exercise and there'll be some microphone

733
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,820
silence.

734
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:15,620
Yeah, and actively contribute to this collaborative document and let us know how it goes.

735
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,620
It's very important for us to get your feedback.

736
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Maybe we could write the exercise time, 20 minutes until 10 here, at least.

737
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,620
Yes.

738
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Yes, please.

739
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,700
Please also mention our colleague who's editing it that if they want more time, please ask.

740
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,660
So it's no point like rushing or like doing it halfway.

741
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,660
Yeah.

742
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,660
Yeah.

743
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:47,060
So 20 minutes is the sort of target, but if you want a little bit more, we can adjust.

744
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,480
[name], I think we should give them some time now

745
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,260
to wrap this around and then do the exercise.

746
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,780
And we'll see you on the other end in that case.

747
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,860
Do you want to keep your screen shared, [name]?

748
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,340
Or do you want somebody else to take it?

749
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,100
OK, we'll do [name], probably, share the notes.

750
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,020
Yes, I'm ready to do that.

751
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,180
Thank you.

752
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,940
Say bye when you're ready.

753
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:17,900
Bye.

754
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,120
you

755
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,120
you

756
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,120
you

757
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,120
you

758
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,120
you

759
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,120
you

760
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,120
you

761
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,120
you

762
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,120
you

763
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,120
you

764
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,120
you

765
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,120
you

766
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,120
you

767
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,120
you

768
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,120
you

769
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,120
you

770
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,120
you

771
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,120
you

772
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,120
you

773
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,120
you

774
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,120
you

775
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,120
you

776
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,120
you

777
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,120
you

778
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,120
you

779
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,120
you

780
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,120
you

781
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:19,120
you

782
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,120
you

783
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,120
you

784
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,120
you

785
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:19,120
you

786
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:49,120
you

787
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,120
you

788
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,120
you

789
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,120
you

790
01:14:47,060 --> 01:15:11,020
Yes, welcome back.

791
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:17,020
I see that most of you have done the exercise and we have received a lot of cool results

792
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,380
requests.

793
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,580
[name], what we do now is that we are

794
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,060
to discuss the answers a little bit

795
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,740
and also the questions in the shared document.

796
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,980
First, we shall have a break now.

797
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,140
I mean, break means you should stop working and walk around

798
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:36,020
and maybe have some coffee or tea.

799
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,420
And then we'll be back.

800
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:40,140
How long should we take, [name]?

801
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,140
10 minutes break.

802
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:41,780
10 minutes?

803
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,340
OK.

804
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:48,260
So we're going to break for 10 minutes,

805
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:52,740
and then we meet here again to discuss.

806
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:55,420
So see you in 10 minutes.

807
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:20,740
let me check on that stream

808
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,400
you

809
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,400
you

810
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,400
you

811
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,400
you

812
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,400
you

813
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,400
you

814
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,400
you

815
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,400
you

816
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,400
you

817
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,400
you

818
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,400
you

819
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,400
you

820
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,400
you

821
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,400
you

822
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,400
you

823
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,400
you

824
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,400
you

825
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:40,900
Welcome back, [name], did you have some rest or were you working?

826
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,300
Yeah, I took my break.

827
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,580
OK.

828
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:51,020
So [name], before I go into this, the request,

829
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:55,140
the viewing the pull requests, I forgot

830
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:58,500
to show that this insight.

831
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:02,260
So that's something very exciting to see sometime.

832
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:07,180
So on the inside, you have something called the network.

833
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:11,740
Here, it will show what's going on in a graphical view.

834
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:14,420
So these are the people who are these different colors

835
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,740
are like different branches.

836
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:21,660
And then they work, for example, this yellow branch.

837
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:24,180
Let me make sure that I'm in the recorded version.

838
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,140
Yes, I'm in the recorded repo.

839
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:29,060
So this yellow change now incorporated

840
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,020
into the main branch, white one.

841
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,460
So the green one also here.

842
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:37,140
So the purple one is also here.

843
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,900
So the yellow and the purple are not the same

844
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,140
because they are two different recipes,

845
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,040
but both of them are now in main.

846
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:48,500
And once we accept pull requests,

847
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,940
this one is not accepted yet,

848
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,300
so this will also go back into the production.

849
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:59,020
So [name], our aim is to contribute to a repository

850
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,460
that you have access to,

851
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:07,100
but not without modifying the main branch.

852
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,740
So a pull request was sent, as you described,

853
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,300
and people have sent the pull request.

854
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,980
And I have sent the request as well.

855
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,540
I see that you have also sent it.

856
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:20,940
I'll just give a quick glance of what is next.

857
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:27,300
So that is the code review that we'll talk a little later.

858
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,300
But [name], while we are here, in this exercise,

859
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,300
we'll talk a little bit about the review as well,

860
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,020
and then summarize later on.

861
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,820
Is that OK?

862
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:40,020
Yes, and I just want to say thank you

863
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,900
to all the requests as well as all the issues created.

864
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,780
That was very good to see.

865
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,980
And we will discuss some of the questions here as well, [name],

866
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:51,340
that I suppose we will have time.

867
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,540
OK, OK, let's do that.

868
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,620
Is there anything very interesting to take first?

869
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:01,260
Very important?

870
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,860
All these I see an answer.

871
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:09,700
OK, so there are some technical questions.

872
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,580
Our colleagues, do you see anything

873
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,700
that we should discuss here?

874
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,540
OK, working in the areas code.

875
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:25,460
OK, so this is also a very specific technical question

876
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,860
that has been answered.

877
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,540
Yeah.

878
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:37,100
And there are some questions about where can you add that source answer fixes that we will show.

879
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,200
OK.

880
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:51,420
Yeah, so if this happens, sometimes you clone it and you start working on it,

881
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:59,260
and then you realize you're in the main branch. So the answer given by our colleague is to

882
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:06,860
Yeah, so the two things are given.

883
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:10,660
So I like the second way that because you are not

884
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:13,740
saying your request yet, although it is your main

885
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:17,140
branch, you could create a branch from that main branch

886
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,140
and send it to the pull request.

887
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:26,420
And then if you send only the branch

888
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:30,140
that you want to be evaluated in the pull request,

889
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:31,860
it will not make a difference.

890
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,300
You could also reset and do again, yes.

891
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:39,100
VS Code, to be honest, [name], I don't use regularly.

892
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,500
I know how it works.

893
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,220
So if there's any questions, we need some help

894
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:46,420
from our colleagues with that.

895
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:53,940
And if you see in our documents, we have these tabs.

896
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,260
For example, this is VS Code, and this is command line.

897
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:59,540
So we give the side-by-side comparison.

898
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,420
So if you show something in the command line,

899
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,340
it shows how to do it in VS Code.

900
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,700
It doesn't mean that you are doing

901
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,260
VS Code and command line.

902
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:10,140
You can select which one to follow.

903
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,460
One thing I want to mention is if you

904
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:15,020
are working on command line and VS Code,

905
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:19,580
you have to authenticate with your SSH key to push the changes.

906
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:25,980
Otherwise, you will have permission issues.

907
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:29,340
Do you want to comment on that, [name]?

908
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,180
Can you describe a little bit, [name]?

909
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:34,140
So if you are working on command line

910
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,260
and you push your changes to the repository,

911
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:40,260
if your SSH authentication is not right,

912
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:44,300
you will not be able to push the changes to the repository.

913
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,180
Yes, yes.

914
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:49,060
So I think if they have set up the keys, it should be OK.

915
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,380
If you face such an issue, please ask here

916
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,700
and we'll try to solve this for you.

917
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,380
Yeah, two things you need to have.

918
01:30:56,380 --> 01:31:03,820
you need to have a permission to push it to this repository

919
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:06,180
where you have to be a collaborator

920
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,300
to push the changes from your local command line.

921
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:15,500
And the other thing is you have SSH set up.

922
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,260
OK.

923
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:19,380
So I see that somebody got this error

924
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:23,900
as which means that they are not requested that access issue.

925
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,660
They are not open the issue that we discussed.

926
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,460
So they are open an issue asking access.

927
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,660
And then another thing is it doesn't matter really

928
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:38,060
what you call the branch.

929
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:42,860
But for myself, the pull request I sent,

930
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:46,220
let's see if I can find it.

931
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,300
I used the branch I used.

932
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,380
I used my name in front and some indication.

933
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,900
Because it's easier for me to find,

934
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:58,900
and maybe it's easier to locate with that.

935
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:03,380
So the default, the name that was used

936
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:07,980
is that unfinished work, new branch, something.

937
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,180
The branch name doesn't really matter,

938
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:16,580
but it should kind of indicate what this is about.

939
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:20,380
Then shall we go through your pull request?

940
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,500
[name], are you ready?

941
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:27,020
Yes and I have added one more person to the reviewer and I got a nice comment on that but

942
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:36,700
you can review again [name] and accept it. Where is it? Your 31 was it? Yeah it would be a chia seed pudding.

943
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:47,100
Okay so I think it's close maybe. Okay. Let's see. Open. I'll just try to get it with the

944
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:52,100
the number because I think it's the other random reviewer.

945
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,160
Yeah.

946
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,400
Okay, it's merged.

947
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,560
So now, [name], we are in a predicament.

948
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,160
So we have like a unplanned event now.

949
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,080
It's been accepted.

950
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,640
So I can't, you know, I could open it and do it.

951
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,960
But would you like to take my screen

952
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,240
and review my pull request instead?

953
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
Yeah, that I can do.

954
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,640
Yeah, when you're ready, just grab it.

955
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,480
Okay.

956
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:29,340
It's not a random person, maybe it's one of our learners.

957
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,340
So thank you for doing that.

958
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:31,340
Yes.

959
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,340
And thank you for the comment.

960
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:35,340
That's not something we were just going to discuss.

961
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:40,100
Where is your pull request, [name]?

962
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,100
My pull request?

963
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:44,300
I think [name] needs to stop screen sharing now.

964
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,300
Okay.

965
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:50,300
So I will stop and my request is 16, pull request number 16.

966
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:56,220
Sorry, the issue is 16, pull request 26.

967
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,160
Okay, yeah.

968
01:33:59,160 --> 01:33:59,980
Yeah, yeah.

969
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:04,860
So I see you made some changes

970
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:09,740
and from your pull request I said made it sweeter

971
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:12,980
and there is fixes 16 and 26.

972
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:18,700
You created some issues, I assume.

973
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,540
Shall we go to the issues just to see that what is it?

974
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,340
Or you want to?

975
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,180
No, you could go to the issue.

976
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:28,780
And before that, I would like to mention

977
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,420
that we should have actually mentioned.

978
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:32,260
So this is public.

979
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,940
And we were supposed to follow the code of conduct

980
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:39,740
and make sure that what we type here and where to send

981
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:45,780
is ethically correct and not sort of breaks those rules.

982
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:50,260
So I hope you already knew and you did that.

983
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:53,460
So sorry, we should have mentioned that before,

984
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:57,180
to be considerate about what's being shown on the internet.

985
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,300
Yes, I opened an issue.

986
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,940
Why is it needed to open an issue, [name]?

987
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:03,140
What do you think is the?

988
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:06,220
I just wanted to see what you are going to fix it.

989
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:12,780
I can check the file changes and see, but maybe what was the issue?

990
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:20,660
So the issue, the reason I opened the issue, [name], is that to inform the developers or

991
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,980
the people who are involved that I'm working on it.

992
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,140
One thing that could happen is, let's say I'm going to suggest this thing, but it's

993
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:33,340
not necessarily in the plan, so that doesn't necessarily fit the main repository or the

994
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:36,460
the main developer's plan or the team's plan.

995
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:39,500
So I don't want to work on something for a long time

996
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,180
and then send it.

997
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,480
And then just to say, you know, this doesn't fit.

998
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:48,480
So start early, before even like making this first change,

999
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:54,240
open an issue, say that, you know, I have this idea,

1000
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,340
I'm going to start working on it.

1001
01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:01,640
So that has two, maybe more advantages,

1002
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,520
but two advantages are there.

1003
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,840
One is people will know that I'm working on it.

1004
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,700
If somebody really think doesn't work,

1005
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,080
they should mention it.

1006
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,520
And the other thing is if another person,

1007
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,880
if another developer, another colleague

1008
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,520
planning to do the work,

1009
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,680
that person could collaborate instead of,

1010
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,760
you know, starting on their own thing.

1011
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,720
So now it is well-informed.

1012
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,680
Okay, the issue is here.

1013
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,400
And this will also create some metadata

1014
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,880
about what we're going to do.

1015
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,780
So later on, this will remain forever.

1016
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,840
So it can be closed, but it will be there.

1017
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,800
So in later on, you could come and check,

1018
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,880
you know, what things happen in a chronological order.

1019
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,160
You know, these are submitted.

1020
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,200
There was some, were there any changes

1021
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,600
who accepted the pull request?

1022
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,800
In addition to the pull request,

1023
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,200
there'll be some documentation or a paper trail,

1024
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,680
we call it, you know, the issue.

1025
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,080
So the issue was open.

1026
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,680
Yes, then that was it.

1027
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:03,380
And one thing I can add is that you can open an issue if you find something is wrong or

1028
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:07,540
something is there and you are not working on it, but let your other members know that

1029
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,060
there is an issue.

1030
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:13,860
So you don't need to assign it to yourself, but if you find something needs to change,

1031
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:17,060
there is something we can fix.

1032
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,380
You don't need to fix it.

1033
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,580
Someone else can fix it to let that there is an issue.

1034
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,860
So that way also you can open an issue.

1035
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:30,820
not necessary that you need to work on that issue that you open. Yes, and also the word issue,

1036
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:36,100
it doesn't really mean something broken, it could be improvement. So on the GitHub world,

1037
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:40,980
we have issues. In the GitLab world, if you're working with lab world, you have issues and

1038
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:49,060
incidents. Now, there are slightly different ways to indicate what you're doing. The main thing is

1039
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:52,980
the word issue does not mean that, you know, there's a problem, it could be an improvement,

1040
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:56,980
it could be some new feature, it could be something broken as well. So it's not just

1041
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:04,420
for reporting bugs. Go ahead, [name]. And I could show that the issue that you are

1042
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:13,220
having a sweeter version of sweet pumpkin pie. I assume that there is a sweet pumpkin pie

1043
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:18,500
somewhere and you want to add a sweeter version of that. Yes. So what do you think about this?

1044
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,300
is like, is it enough information here?

1045
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:24,900
No, unfortunately, I have to assume many things here.

1046
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:25,900
Yes.

1047
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:33,020
So if one thing I can ask you, if I see that you haven't

1048
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:36,140
assigned it here, but if you want to work on it,

1049
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,740
you can assign to yourself here.

1050
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:42,260
And there are some levels we could add.

1051
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:45,380
If it is bulk documentation enhancement,

1052
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:49,860
I assume that you are supposed to enhance something already there.

1053
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:50,740
Yeah.

1054
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:56,900
So there's also a good way to add here, assign labels and et cetera.

1055
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:02,580
And if I don't find things, maybe provide a bit more context on this.

1056
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:07,820
I, we can have a conversation if it is not, if you are not working on it also,

1057
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:13,100
but on an issue, as a collaborator, we can have a discussion and find out a

1058
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:18,900
common ground to further develop this problem or improvement

1059
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,260
or anything.

1060
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:25,700
So now you found my issue, and the quality of the issue

1061
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,420
is not that good.

1062
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,900
It's not descriptive.

1063
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,500
So that should be more mentioning.

1064
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:32,700
And you found that it's better to add a label itself.

1065
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,300
So could you add a label for me, a suitable label,

1066
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,620
so it will be the next person who

1067
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:39,220
will see the issue as better?

1068
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:42,820
Yes, and I just want to mention that this label

1069
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:45,580
is different for projects, you can edit labels.

1070
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,500
You can add labels according to your project needs.

1071
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,540
So you can add like in progress or whatever you want,

1072
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,860
that there is an option to edit labels,

1073
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:58,580
but this is already mentioned some labels.

1074
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:00,700
So I will use an enhancement.

1075
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:07,020
Maybe I will ask [name] to give more context to this.

1076
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:12,620
I can mention him here.

1077
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:15,780
So [name] will get notified whenever I mention

1078
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,860
and comment it here.

1079
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:18,580
So we can have a conversation.

1080
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:24,420
And then one more thing that might be a little confusing

1081
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,900
is that the question 21,

1082
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:32,940
the question that asked about this permission issues,

1083
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:35,980
opening an issue will not give you permission on this repo.

1084
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:38,740
So what I mentioned in the beginning about opening issue

1085
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:40,020
was there was this repository

1086
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:43,580
that we were giving permissions, adding you to a group.

1087
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:46,420
So you had to open issue there, so we can manually

1088
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,860
take your username and give you permission.

1089
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:51,100
So opening an issue in this report

1090
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:53,460
does not mean you get permission to push.

1091
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:54,900
So just a clarification.

1092
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:57,780
Yeah, good point, [shari].

1093
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:00,740
So we can have a conversation here,

1094
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:04,420
but just let us go to your full request.

1095
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:06,980
Yeah.

1096
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:13,900
So I can see that you have one commit and one file changed.

1097
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,300
Shall we go?

1098
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,460
Yes.

1099
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:21,460
So I purposefully made it extremely sweet.

1100
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,700
So maybe it doesn't fit.

1101
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,900
Maybe you could see whether that's OK.

1102
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:31,900
And I could change if it doesn't.

1103
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,660
So this is now we are actually in the review process, which

1104
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:38,700
is the next topic that we're going to talk about.

1105
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:41,260
But we'll start from now itself.

1106
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:45,100
So how do you make a suggestion, [name],

1107
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:50,340
in addition to being polite and being considerate?

1108
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:54,220
Yeah, mostly I see that this is all these plus signs.

1109
01:41:54,220 --> 01:42:00,100
That means it's only addition to these changes.

1110
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,980
Normally, if there is plus lines,

1111
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,660
I will not have much to look at it.

1112
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,180
That's how I work, because it's.

1113
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,380
But if you have some changes here,

1114
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:17,260
then you will see that there is a red color rather than

1115
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,500
a green color, right?

1116
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,260
That's a good point, [name].

1117
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:25,340
So if it is an existing file, and it has a difference,

1118
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:29,140
the things added will be green, things deleted will be red.

1119
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:33,580
But because this is a new file that Kit didn't know before,

1120
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,820
everything is green.

1121
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:38,620
Yeah, you can see that here, plus 37 lines added,

1122
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,820
there is no line changed.

1123
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:44,780
This is something I will look into it first.

1124
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:48,660
Mostly there is something changed.

1125
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:51,180
Then what about line 17?

1126
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:54,100
What do you think in this file?

1127
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:55,620
40 cups sugar.

1128
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:57,420
Yeah.

1129
01:42:57,420 --> 01:42:59,780
So yes.

1130
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:03,700
Yeah, I will click on this plus sign or on this line,

1131
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,460
and I will.

1132
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:09,820
OK, yeah, it's too sweet, isn't it?

1133
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:18,460
Then when you, yeah, so just send me the,

1134
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,660
when you click the button, I'll also get the message

1135
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,020
that you informed that.

1136
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:39,940
Yeah, so I see that you're using like maybe words like maybe, could, you know, the feedback

1137
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:46,740
should be, you know, it should be, you know, positive in a way that, you know, the changes

1138
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:51,700
are sent, but it should start kind of like a negative conversation saying, you know,

1139
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:52,700
this is bad.

1140
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,700
Can we change it?

1141
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:55,540
You could use the same thing.

1142
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:57,860
You could convey the message that it

1143
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:00,100
has to be changed in the polite language.

1144
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:07,500
I see that you are being extremely polite.

1145
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,620
What does beta mean?

1146
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:09,580
Oh, by the way.

1147
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:12,140
Yeah, OK.

1148
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,100
Yeah, thanks for the recipe.

1149
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:19,420
And then I will add this single comment or start review.

1150
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,660
Where do you do?

1151
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:21,540
What do you do?

1152
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,820
So you could start the review.

1153
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:25,980
So, yes.

1154
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:30,380
Yeah, so then let me check whether I got that message.

1155
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:37,540
Let me see.

1156
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:38,780
Yes, you have done that.

1157
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,300
Slight delay on my part.

1158
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,300
I'm still waiting.

1159
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,080
OK.

1160
01:44:52,820 --> 01:45:03,780
Yes, I've still not got it.

1161
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:10,380
But until that, my side refreshes.

1162
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:13,460
Let's say if you want to make a change directly, how would you do that?

1163
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:18,240
So I will answer this, the 40 cups sugar in a moment.

1164
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,400
But let's say if you want to change, for example,

1165
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:24,240
salt amount, is it possible as a reviewer

1166
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:27,040
for you to suggest a change directly in addition

1167
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,400
to asking me?

1168
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,640
Yeah, I can directly suggest that.

1169
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:36,400
For that, I usually go to the branch and do the changes.

1170
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,240
But there is the, yeah, go ahead, Sudhir.

1171
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:45,040
Yeah, so I mean, during the review process,

1172
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,080
that let's say if you want to change something,

1173
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:52,080
you don't have to necessarily like open a new pull request

1174
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:52,940
or close it.

1175
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,720
So that's what you are trying to say maybe.

1176
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:57,920
Yes, yes, yeah, that's right.

1177
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,120
So if I'm a collaborator,

1178
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:06,120
I have this permission to edit [name]'s branch

1179
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,160
that he put, that's this pull request.

1180
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:12,480
You can see that main from [name] sweet pumpkin.

1181
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,560
So I can go and edit that.

1182
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,520
So I will have the commit there.

1183
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,560
And then the pull request will be updated accordingly.

1184
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,560
There is no need for me to change anything there.

1185
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:27,680
Yes.

1186
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:33,480
Another thing we can do in the interface itself,

1187
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,600
I see that because I'm not getting this, because you

1188
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,560
are not finished your review.

1189
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,880
Maybe we could, in that, yes.

1190
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:47,040
If you can finish the review and make a commit

1191
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,440
without approving it, then I might get the message.

1192
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:52,040
So that is also a good thing that we

1193
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:55,200
so that until you finish it, I don't get the message just

1194
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,400
by answering that question.

1195
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,280
So I can make this change?

1196
01:46:59,280 --> 01:46:59,780
Yeah.

1197
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,180
Yeah?

1198
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,400
Yes.

1199
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,600
So you could submit that.

1200
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,560
Okay, now I got it. So I'm going to.

1201
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:37,960
Meanwhile, I will check if there is some questions that we need to answer.

1202
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:54,800
Yeah, so then I, I replied to that, did you, did you see my reply?

1203
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:59,280
Maybe a refresh of the pull request itself.

1204
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,280
Yeah.

1205
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,280
Okay.

1206
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:09,640
Okay, so then somebody else has mentioned that as well.

1207
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:27,640
What I'm saying here is that, okay, no, thank you, indeed, you know, you've found it, but I'm on a flight, you know, this is this internet on the flight. So let's see later whether you could change it for me. So the way, you know, the web interface that we could you do this easily as a reviewer is that if you go back to the file itself.

1208
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,640
If you go to that 40, the number 17

1209
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:49,040
Maybe on the on the last, yeah, yes, okay, when you click that, what happens?

1210
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,040
Nothing happens.

1211
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,040
That's strange.

1212
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:52,040
Okay.

1213
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,040
Yeah.

1214
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,860
So that's, that's another another good catch as well.

1215
01:48:56,860 --> 01:49:03,640
So what I will do is that maybe if you go further downward, you see, yeah, so it's other

1216
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,720
part of this fight.

1217
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:09,720
So what I will do is, I will resolve this conversation.

1218
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:11,200
You want to take over the screen?

1219
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:11,960
No, no, no, no.

1220
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,480
We have to find out how to do it properly,

1221
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,760
because it's not happening as I expected,

1222
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,120
but we'll figure it out.

1223
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,160
If you refresh it again.

1224
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:32,000
OK, now if you go to plus again, the yeah.

1225
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,560
And you see that you have Google,

1226
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,860
not that one, the plus.

1227
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,520
And then after right, you have the button called review.

1228
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,920
After that, you have this plus sign.

1229
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,080
You go to right again.

1230
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:48,100
After review, you find a small button.

1231
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,520
If you click that, you could actually change from 40 to four

1232
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,720
if you, yes, you could do a space

1233
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:02,720
and then you could start the review.

1234
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:07,720
Or like, you know, you could actually add the comment there.

1235
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And then you could finish up the review process.

1236
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,480
You could actually approve it now

1237
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,080
because now you have changed it.

1238
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:29,000
Then now what happened is that

1239
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,240
without even going to the terminal,

1240
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,080
so you managed to find some issue

1241
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,040
and you informed with me in a very polite

1242
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:39,960
and very positive way, the positive feedback.

1243
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,200
And then I couldn't change it for some reason.

1244
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,480
And then as a reviewer, you managed to do the change

1245
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,200
without even making a branch or anything.

1246
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,160
You were in the same branch,

1247
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:53,040
were in the same pull request, same narrative,

1248
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:58,040
the same discussions going on,

1249
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,160
on, the issue would be updated.

1250
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,520
We did that there.

1251
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,020
Yes.

1252
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:04,120
And I need to commit the suggestion.

1253
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,400
Correct.

1254
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,440
Yeah.

1255
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,800
And you could have a commit message there,

1256
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,560
saying this was actually [name] who

1257
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:20,680
tried to make it sick, not sick, too sweet.

1258
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:25,200
So we had to reduce the sugar amount.

1259
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:26,600
And oh, maybe it was a typo.

1260
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:32,440
OK.

1261
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,200
Assuming.

1262
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,480
Yeah.

1263
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,680
And then commit changes.

1264
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:43,080
So one thing I want to show you here,

1265
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,480
earlier it was only one commit.

1266
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:49,160
And I did change this suggestion commit.

1267
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,640
You can see that there are two commits.

1268
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,840
And let's go and see that.

1269
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:02,280
So first, once [name] mentioned and in that commit [name] mentioned the issue as well

1270
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:09,440
that he was working on and then I fix, I committed the suggestion that I made.

1271
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,440
Okay.

1272
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:14,440
Shall we go back and merge it?

1273
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:17,280
Yes, please.

1274
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:23,080
So do you have, you have mentioned two issues here and let's see what happens when we merge

1275
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:24,080
the pull request.

1276
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:24,580
to the issue.

1277
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:27,000
Have I mentioned two issues?

1278
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,720
I think.

1279
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,000
Uh-huh, yes.

1280
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,240
That's actually a typo.

1281
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:37,040
So before you close that, let me edit that title a little bit.

1282
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:43,120
So you can do that with the edit?

1283
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:47,000
No, actually, it is actually the, yeah.

1284
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,760
So yeah, so that's a good point.

1285
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,760
So it is not actually referring to two issues.

1286
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,200
That means that it is the pull request number 26.

1287
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:53,700
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:57,700
In the title, I have mentioned the issue.

1289
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:00,300
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1290
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:02,260
Yeah, that's a good point.

1291
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:03,180
Yes.

1292
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:05,020
Yes, and I reviewed.

1293
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:08,780
And maybe what you usually do, you say thank you message.

1294
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:11,020
And I see [name] all the time saying thank you.

1295
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:13,940
And he mentioned something.

1296
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,380
Yeah, so he's too polite.

1297
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:17,900
So yeah, we could mention that.

1298
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:18,820
OK, now it's solved.

1299
01:53:18,820 --> 01:53:19,500
Thank you.

1300
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:20,740
Yes.

1301
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,660
And there are some questions in the HackMD,

1302
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,540
The shared document, we'll come back to that a little later.

1303
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,420
I see a lot of discussions going on with our colleagues.

1304
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:28,940
OK.

1305
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:30,420
Yeah, that's where we'll come back.

1306
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:35,820
Now it's done.

1307
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:36,500
So it's done.

1308
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:38,820
And maybe we could just delete the branch as well,

1309
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:41,980
because otherwise it'll collect a lot of unnecessary branches.

1310
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:42,740
Yes.

1311
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:43,380
That's done.

1312
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:44,180
It's gone.

1313
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:47,460
Deleting the branch doesn't lose any information,

1314
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:48,980
because everything in that branch

1315
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:51,820
is now integrated into the main branch.

1316
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:55,180
Yeah, I just want to check what happened to the issue you created.

1317
01:53:58,780 --> 01:53:59,820
Yeah, it's closed.

1318
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:04,380
If you click on the closed one and click on number 16.

1319
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:11,740
Yeah, take one issue and type 16 at the end in the URL, maybe it's easier to

1320
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:16,460
anything and at the end type 16.

1321
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,100
Yeah, because it's a bit difficult for me.

1322
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,100
Okay.

1323
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:21,100
Okay.

1324
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:22,100
Let me see.

1325
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,100
Closed.

1326
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:26,100
Yeah, it's further down now, under closed, yes.

1327
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:29,100
Yeah, you have one closed tissue.

1328
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:30,100
Yes.

1329
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:32,100
So I can get it.

1330
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,100
Yes.

1331
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:34,100
That's a good.

1332
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,100
Okay.

1333
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:38,100
Can you, can you briefly explain what, how you found that again?

1334
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,100
Yeah, I can.

1335
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:47,660
issue. So I filter it. Yes, that's a good. Can you briefly explain how you found that again?

1336
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:56,460
Yeah, I can. So we have issues and I was trying to see if [name]'s issue is here and I was not

1337
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:04,860
able to find it. So I know that [name] was created with the issue. So he is the author. So I clicked

1338
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:15,080
His name and I see there is no open issue on under his name and one closed issue.

1339
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:20,000
So this is the one I found it like that.

1340
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:27,240
You can use GitHub for many other like this, but it's not necessary that you need to find

1341
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,240
everything today.

1342
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:34,840
This is for you to have a hands on and we will.

1343
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:38,280
I think when we do things only, we will find many ways.

1344
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:43,200
I think I have to find many functions on the GitHub yet,

1345
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,880
because I use GitLab every day.

1346
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,400
Sometimes it's a bit difficult to find it here.

1347
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,680
But that's OK.

1348
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:55,440
It's the matter of time that you practice.

1349
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,360
Yes.

1350
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,320
And you can also see in the issue, [name],

1351
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:01,440
the commit message, the commit that you did,

1352
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,640
the hash for the commit, and also the merge request.

1353
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,640
Everything is linked.

1354
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:06,720
So you have some paper trail here as well.

1355
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,000
Yeah.

1356
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:08,800
Yes, OK.

1357
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:15,000
I think that sort of summarizes what

1358
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:21,000
we will plan to do for that part of the exercise.

1359
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,520
Shall we have a look at the shared document as you add it

1360
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,520
and see?

1361
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:29,120
Let me check our chat to see whether our colleagues found

1362
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:29,920
out something.

1363
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,420
Yes.

1364
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:37,120
There was supposed to be a mic option like yesterday,

1365
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,600
And I didn't see that, so.

1366
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,200
Question number 20.

1367
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,000
Can you score what was it about?

1368
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,200
Let's see.

1369
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,240
Our colleague [name] is mentioning about it.

1370
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:49,740
OK.

1371
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:50,480
Interaction.

1372
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:56,880
How to push and pull from local repository to GitHub, maybe.

1373
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:00,340
OK.

1374
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:07,460
So I think what I'll do is I can show that,

1375
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:11,700
because we were doing on the terminal a lot.

1376
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:14,340
Sorry, on the web page, because we

1377
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:16,260
want to make it a little simple.

1378
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:21,300
But I can show how to do that on the terminal,

1379
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,180
if that makes sense.

1380
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:24,220
How are we on time, Daniel?

1381
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:27,940
I think we have almost 18 minutes till lunch break.

1382
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,260
OK.

1383
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:36,460
So is the next one we are starting after the lunch?

1384
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:37,180
Yeah.

1385
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:39,980
But I would like to discuss a little bit on the review

1386
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:42,540
process and things.

1387
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:47,860
Would be nice that we talk a little bit about the review.

1388
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:50,820
So do you expect that if we collaborate,

1389
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:54,340
only the owner or admin will review?

1390
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:57,700
Or how do you explain the reviewing?

1391
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:02,060
because I reviewed it, and I just want to say that all of you

1392
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:04,820
can review each other's pull request

1393
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:06,300
and comment it just like that.

1394
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,340
It is not any hierarchy here.

1395
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:12,700
And this is, we all are collaborators

1396
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:15,100
in a collaborating repository.

1397
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:17,460
So there is no senior, junior,

1398
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:21,420
no differences with reviewing.

1399
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:24,020
And you can see that what I was doing,

1400
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:27,220
you learn by reviewing many things.

1401
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:33,660
So, actively participate in code reviewing, that's somewhere you can learn a lot and it

1402
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:43,380
should not be anything role-based or any supervisor or anyone.

1403
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:48,420
Any collaborator should be able to review things and have a conversation and one thing

1404
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:55,380
to make sure what I would suggest is to have a good collaborative environment on your repository.

1405
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:58,660
being polite what we said.

1406
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:05,460
Anything you want to add [name] regarding that?

1407
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:08,580
Yeah, I think that's a perfect explanation.

1408
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:12,580
The

1409
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:18,020
one thing actually like in companies

1410
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:21,620
also like in the working environments like we are

1411
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:25,300
is that it's okay for a junior person to review let's say if there's

1412
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:29,380
as a new colleague, that person could review experienced

1413
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:31,020
persons' commits as well.

1414
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:34,020
So that's also a learning experience.

1415
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:36,740
So I set up my terminal, [name].

1416
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:39,500
So I could just show these things

1417
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:43,020
because there's a very specific question about it.

1418
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:43,740
Yes.

1419
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:44,940
I'll take over the screen.

1420
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:54,540
Let me fix my terminal a little bit.

1421
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:57,060
Is my terminal font visible?

1422
01:59:57,060 --> 02:00:01,940
Is it enough or should I make it a little bigger?

1423
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:03,060
OK.

1424
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,780
I am sharing, so.

1425
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,380
Yeah, [name], you need to stop.

1426
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:09,380
OK.

1427
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:10,940
After [name] stops, I'll do that.

1428
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:14,100
So the question is that this pooling and pushing

1429
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:16,860
and the terms that we used.

1430
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:20,860
We used the browser to show you the setup,

1431
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:22,220
so we didn't come to the terminal.

1432
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:24,740
but what we can do is that,

1433
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:26,900
let me adjust my screen a little bit.

1434
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:31,980
So I don't want to show my desktop.

1435
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:32,820
Yeah.

1436
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,140
So this is the repository we have.

1437
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:43,140
So here I go to the recorded one

1438
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:47,940
because I don't want to show the private one.

1439
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:54,580
centralized template for centralized workflow.

1440
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:58,580
So this is the exercise report that we had.

1441
02:00:58,580 --> 02:00:59,540
So there's an issue.

1442
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:03,980
So I open another issue.

1443
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,780
I'll be a little quick,

1444
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,660
but these are not good comments.

1445
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:17,660
We have to, so I opened an issue and then submit it,

1446
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:27,380
but that we do it in the GitHub interface,

1447
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:28,220
not on the terminal.

1448
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,120
So that's done.

1449
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,220
And then I go to the code.

1450
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:39,140
I take the SSH and I clone it, copy.

1451
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:47,340
And I could also show one more thing here is that I already cloned that repository before.

1452
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,620
So I have something with the same name.

1453
02:01:49,620 --> 02:02:03,260
So what I will do is I will clone it, but I'll give a new name.

1454
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:08,100
So when you are cloning it, you could specify which name to give.

1455
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,740
If you don't do that, it'll use the name of the repository.

1456
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:15,800
So I have two folders now.

1457
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:17,040
So that is the cloning process.

1458
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:20,600
I got a copy down to my laptop.

1459
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:24,520
So I go to my new repository.

1460
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:27,840
Let me go up a little bit

1461
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,840
so I have more real estate to show you.

1462
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:33,360
So I have these folders.

1463
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:36,080
Maybe I'll go to deserts.

1464
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:40,400
So I went to that desert and I'll check the branch.

1465
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,720
Git branch, this commands we learn.

1466
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:47,440
So I'm in the main branch.

1467
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,580
I will check the git status.

1468
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:52,160
So status is clean.

1469
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:55,360
So there was the, one other question was to accidentally

1470
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,440
start working on the main branch and what to do.

1471
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,600
So I will imagine that, you know,

1472
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:06,020
I forgot to create a branch, but I start working.

1473
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:11,080
Let's see, I'll copy the chickpeas recipe

1474
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:14,460
because I don't want to create a new one, new chickpeas.

1475
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:19,500
So this simulates that I create a new file.

1476
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:22,520
Then I edit that.

1477
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:27,340
Let's make it two.

1478
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:31,540
And when you edit that,

1479
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:34,300
my muscle memory opened the Vim editor.

1480
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:36,460
So you could be the editor of your choice

1481
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,980
that we learned yesterday.

1482
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:41,860
And now I did something on the main branch.

1483
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:44,820
But there's still more time to create a new branch.

1484
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:47,540
So I ask git status.

1485
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:51,740
There is a modified file here.

1486
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:55,020
But I could still create git.

1487
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:57,860
If you learned the commands, the practice yesterday,

1488
02:03:57,860 --> 02:04:00,540
you could do this in one command, actually.

1489
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:04,140
I'm going to check out.

1490
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:19,340
a new branch called, I'll call it the piece, with an S to make it a little funnier.

1491
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:24,060
Then I'm in the new branch, git status.

1492
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:33,180
So it says that command was not found because I misspelled it, status.

1493
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:35,860
So a new file is still there.

1494
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:39,380
I will ask git branch.

1495
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:40,820
So I'm in the correct branch.

1496
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:41,900
Now I can commit.

1497
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:47,540
So I created the file while I'm in the main branch, but still there's room to switch to

1498
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:48,740
a new branch.

1499
02:04:48,740 --> 02:05:02,740
I will git add new this video learn, then git commit with a message, this fixes issue

1500
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:04,660
42.

1501
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:06,900
So I did that.

1502
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:17,100
So then I ask it status, again wrong spellings, status, now everything is clean.

1503
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,860
but I can do is do that push. I pull

1504
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:30,460
push it again, git push origin. So the origin is the

1505
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:37,260
the place I copied from. So there's a label given to that origin. I want to do it upstream.

1506
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:42,380
It depends on your setup on your local computer, but this is safer to make mention

1507
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:46,540
that, you know, I had to send upstream

1508
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:11,340
a pull request now in order to incorporate it. So we pulled it to a local computer,

1509
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:15,100
we made the changes, we pushed it, and then we're going to send compare pull request.

1510
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:24,380
Then I will send fixes. Okay, I'm going to get it here.

1511
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:44,540
I think I spelled it wrongly, but I can check the spellings because Git is good at checking

1512
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:47,500
the spellings.

1513
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:50,660
So now that thing happened in the title

1514
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:58,180
will not happen now with more details.

1515
02:06:58,180 --> 02:06:59,140
Create a pull request.

1516
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:01,660
So we're seeing the word pull again.

1517
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:04,940
But in GitLab, you will see the merge word.

1518
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:07,500
So two different uses of that.

1519
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:09,900
But this is a pull request, and earlier was a pull.

1520
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:14,900
So that's what we meant by push and pull.

1521
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:18,740
So, our colleagues, is that clear enough?

1522
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:26,900
Yeah, I think it answers the question.

1523
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:29,260
And what are we going to do next, [name]?

1524
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,660
Are we going for a break or?

1525
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:36,140
We are supposed to have a lunch break,

1526
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:38,940
but do you want to take, we have some time left for that,

1527
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:42,020
but do you want to take some question?

1528
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:43,220
Yes, yes.

1529
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:49,620
You still see my screen, so I'm going to open the notes.

1530
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:56,780
I'll hide the terminal, so we don't need that anymore for the time being.

1531
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:07,940
Maybe I can show you one more thing before I close the terminal, [name], is that, you

1532
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:12,860
know, now we mentioned that the disconnection, the clone.

1533
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:17,860
So now our local repository, main branch is,

1534
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:23,100
I will clear this, we are in the git branch.

1535
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:28,300
Again, I'm typing wrong spellings.

1536
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:32,820
I mean this, my branch, but if I go to git checkout main,

1537
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:39,460
main branch, my main branch would not have the same recipe

1538
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:44,460
as the file I sent.

1539
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:49,260
For example, let's see, was it in the cheat piece?

1540
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:52,700
But if you see the file, what was that name?

1541
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:54,820
I'll go back to my branch, let's just see.

1542
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:02,080
So you see there's a new cheat piece,

1543
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:03,880
it's not in the main branch.

1544
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:08,880
So what I should do is I should go to the main branch

1545
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:12,820
branch and do a git pull again.

1546
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:17,540
Git pull, origin, main.

1547
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:21,260
I'll increase the terminal a little bit.

1548
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:24,820
So you see, what I'm going to do is get down

1549
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:26,100
all the changes to main.

1550
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:31,020
And then that command would bring down that change.

1551
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:34,140
So this is how you synchronize on the terminal.

1552
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:35,060
Yeah.

1553
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,580
Just a comment on that.

1554
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:38,860
You have seen push and pull.

1555
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:43,460
That's something we use to communicate with the GitHub

1556
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:45,700
repository from the command line.

1557
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:48,100
But pull request is something different,

1558
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:49,460
where you suggest the changes.

1559
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:54,700
Sometimes it might be a bit confused.

1560
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:56,420
You have pull and pull request.

1561
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:58,860
So pull is the communication way.

1562
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:01,580
Pull request is you are suggesting the changes

1563
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:03,980
to the repository.

1564
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:04,460
Yes.

1565
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:08,900
So we are actually asking the owner to pull from me.

1566
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:12,060
So I pull from the owner first, I push back,

1567
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:15,700
and then the pull request is the request,

1568
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,500
can you pull from me?

1569
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:19,980
So I give you this, pull it up.

1570
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:26,300
So any other questions that we want to mention?

1571
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:27,140
Let's see.

1572
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:32,860
About what type of files can be tracked, okay.

1573
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,900
Which question is about file tracking?

1574
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:43,740
Let's see, can somebody give me the number of the question?

1575
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:49,260
29, thank you.

1576
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:50,100
29.

1577
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:51,300
Yeah.

1578
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:52,980
Yeah, the word files.

1579
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:03,860
Yes.

1580
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:09,940
So the thing with the word files, [name], and also the colleague who asked the question,

1581
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:14,660
is that the word file to the computer is not the word file the human sees.

1582
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:16,500
So there's a lot of metadata.

1583
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:20,620
So if you create a word file, and if you try to look at it on a terminal, for example,

1584
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:25,420
with a less or a cat command, it will show so many things.

1585
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:27,520
So it's possible to track it.

1586
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:35,720
But let's say a small change of making a text bold would change a lot.

1587
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:41,840
So it is not that convenient to track that.

1588
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:47,440
But if you're using Word, then you could use, you know, people ask whether they could use

1589
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:48,440
Git.

1590
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:53,560
You know, it's okay to use Git, you know, to have it version control.

1591
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:55,980
For example, you can go back into certain versions.

1592
02:11:55,980 --> 02:12:04,860
So you don't necessarily need to read the code, the bytes,

1593
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:06,020
in order to do that.

1594
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:08,060
But you can't do a diff, for example.

1595
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,620
So let's say if I have a Word file,

1596
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:14,260
and if I made a bold text, and I save it and commit it,

1597
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:17,260
the difference between the two commits,

1598
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:20,460
very difficult to see it's a bolding text,

1599
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:22,300
no bolding character.

1600
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:25,620
So for that reason, you could use other version system

1601
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:28,900
that Word is good at, for example, Microsoft 365,

1602
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:32,220
or upload it to Google.

1603
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:37,100
And Google Docs, there are other setups.

1604
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:39,300
These are really personal opinions.

1605
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:41,460
So there could be many opinions.

1606
02:12:41,460 --> 02:12:44,300
So it's better not to do that.

1607
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:48,220
But you could do that technically.

1608
02:12:48,220 --> 02:12:52,340
Yeah, and text files and all the code, R script or Python,

1609
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:55,580
Everything works quite well with the version control.

1610
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:58,020
Markdown is kind of a text file, but it

1611
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:04,180
has a specific, what you call, speciality with the headings

1612
02:13:04,180 --> 02:13:06,780
and all other marking.

1613
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:11,580
You can just have similar text files and readme files.

1614
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:15,220
Those are simple text files.

1615
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:22,140
And ASCII data sets, that's very good with the version control.

1616
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:23,980
Yes.

1617
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:25,140
Let's see, anything else?

1618
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:31,220
Commits in a conversation.

1619
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:38,100
Yes, so you could.

1620
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,540
Yeah, so this is actually a good question

1621
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:43,340
that we have an answer for that.

1622
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:47,300
So how to mention a commit.

1623
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:48,700
This is a good answer.

1624
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:51,180
Another way, like I would say, you

1625
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:53,180
have to think a little bit opposite way.

1626
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:56,220
When you think of like this, you showed that, [name],

1627
02:13:56,220 --> 02:14:01,900
is that you could mention a commit.

1628
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:06,020
But let's say if you're referring to a certain commit,

1629
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:11,220
and it's even better to be more specific.

1630
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:16,180
So you could specifically refer to the line

1631
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,460
that you are mentioning.

1632
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:20,700
Or you could have this commit text.

1633
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:25,180
Let me go to the recorded version.

1634
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:30,220
And then when you see the, because my screen

1635
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:35,540
is a little shrink, I had to find the commits.

1636
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:38,660
That hash number, that you get the short number,

1637
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:41,500
so that git is capable of figuring it out.

1638
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:44,580
So if you can copy that, copy to the mouse

1639
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:46,500
or right click or Control-C, as mentioned,

1640
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:49,820
you could always use that.

1641
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:52,260
But usually, what we do is the opposite.

1642
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,740
So as I mentioned in the beginning,

1643
02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:57,140
rather than mentioning copying the commit to an issue,

1644
02:14:57,140 --> 02:15:03,900
we refer to an issue in a commit with a hash.

1645
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:09,420
Yes.

1646
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:12,900
So I think, [name], we should go for the break now,

1647
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:14,940
the lunch break.

1648
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:18,540
Yeah, I just want to mention thank you for all this push,

1649
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:20,540
pull request, and creating the issue,

1650
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:23,980
and actively participating on the stream,

1651
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:28,540
as well as I assume that you are participating as a team.

1652
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:31,820
But if you have questions, please keep it coming.

1653
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:35,140
And next, what we are going to do, [name],

1654
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:38,860
we are going to have a forking exercise, right?

1655
02:15:38,860 --> 02:15:39,980
After the lunch.

1656
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:41,380
Yes.

1657
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:43,580
But before the lunch, there's some technical issue

1658
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:45,460
that I need to solve with the director.

1659
02:15:48,380 --> 02:15:49,100
Let's see.

1660
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:56,900
Is [name] still around, or is [name] around?

1661
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:58,820
Yes, I'm here.

1662
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:01,140
So we are going for the break now, [name].

1663
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:03,100
OK.

1664
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:06,180
And then let me say it's mentioned.

1665
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:09,900
Yeah, maybe [name] can help us to mention the break.

1666
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:12,660
I couldn't find it here still.

1667
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:16,340
It's until an hour break, right?

1668
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:16,840
Yeah.

1669
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:22,100
Was it one hour, 15 minutes?

1670
02:16:22,100 --> 02:16:23,780
How?

1671
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:24,740
One hour.

1672
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:25,620
One hour, OK.

1673
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,940
Yeah, so we'll meet again.

1674
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:31,660
And yeah, so then have a break, have a great lunch.

1675
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,780
And we will meet afterwards.

1676
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:36,980
And we will work with the repository

1677
02:16:36,980 --> 02:16:39,420
that you will not get access.

1678
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:42,060
How would you contribute?

1679
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:43,900
Anything else, [name], before we break?

1680
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:44,620
No, thank you.

1681
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,980
OK, see you then.

1682
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:47,540
See you.

1683
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:14,120
you

1684
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:44,120
you

1685
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:14,120
you

1686
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:44,120
you

1687
02:19:12,060 --> 02:19:14,120
you

1688

you

1692
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:44,120
you

1693
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:14,120
you

1694
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:44,120
you

1695
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:14,120
you

1696
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:44,120
you

1697
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,120
you

1698
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:44,120
you

1699
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:14,120
you

1700
02:25:42,060 --> 02:25:44,120
you

1701
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:14,120
you

1702
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:44,120
you

1703
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:14,120
you

1704
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:44,120
you

1705
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:14,120
you

1706
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:44,120
you

1707
02:29:12,060 --> 02:29:14,120
you

1708
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:44,120
you

1709
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:14,120
you

1710
02:30:42,060 --> 02:30:44,120
you

1711
02:31:12,060 --> 02:31:14,120
you

1712

02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:44,120
you

02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:14,120
you

1738
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:44,120
you

1739
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:14,120

1748
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:44,120
you

1749
02:50:12,060 --> 02:50:14,120
you

1750
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:44,120
you

1751
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:14,120
you

1752
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:44,120
you

1753
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:14,120
you

1754
02:52:42,060 --> 02:52:44,120
you

1755
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:14,120
you

1756
02:53:42,060 --> 02:53:44,120
you

1757
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:14,120

1761
02:56:12,060 --> 02:56:14,120
you

1762
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:44,120
you

1763
02:57:12,060 --> 02:57:14,120
you

1764
02:57:42,060 --> 02:57:44,120
you

1765
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:14,120
you

1766
02:58:42,060 --> 02:58:44,120
you

1767
02:59:12,060 --> 02:59:14,120
you

1768
02:59:42,060 --> 02:59:44,120
you

1769
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:14,120
you

1770
03:00:42,060 --> 03:00:44,120
you

1771
03:01:12,060 --> 03:01:14,120
you

1772
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:44,120
you

1773
03:02:12,060 --> 03:02:14,120
you

1774
03:02:42,060 --> 03:02:44,120
you

1775
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:14,120
you

1776
03:03:42,060 --> 03:03:44,120
you

1777
03:04:12,060 --> 03:04:14,120
you

1778
03:04:42,060 --> 03:04:44,120
you

03:05:12,060 --> 03:05:14,120
you

1780
03:05:42,060 --> 03:05:44,120
you

1781
03:06:12,060 --> 03:06:14,120
you

1782
03:06:42,060 --> 03:06:44,120
you

1783
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:14,120
you

1784
03:07:42,060 --> 03:07:44,120
you

1785
03:08:12,060 --> 03:08:14,120
you

1786
03:08:42,060 --> 03:08:44,120
you

1787
03:09:12,060 --> 03:09:14,120
you

1788
03:09:42,060 --> 03:09:44,120
you

1789
03:10:12,060 --> 03:10:14,120
you

1790
03:10:42,060 --> 03:10:44,120
you

1791
03:11:12,060 --> 03:11:14,120
you

1792
03:11:42,060 --> 03:11:44,120
you

1793
03:12:12,060 --> 03:12:14,120
you

1794
03:12:42,060 --> 03:12:44,120
you

1795
03:13:12,060 --> 03:13:14,120
you

1796
03:13:42,060 --> 03:13:44,120
you

1797
03:14:12,060 --> 03:14:14,120
you

1798
03:14:42,060 --> 03:14:44,120
you

1799
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:14,120
you

1800
03:15:42,060 --> 03:15:44,120
you

1801
03:16:12,060 --> 03:16:14,120
you

1802
03:16:42,060 --> 03:16:53,060
Welcome back. Did you have a good lunch or good rest?

1803
03:16:53,060 --> 03:17:00,060
Yes, yes. I just finished my lunch and get ready for more GIT for dessert.

1804
03:17:00,060 --> 03:17:05,060
Okay, you will get some more dessert today for sure.

1805
03:17:05,060 --> 03:17:10,060
Thank you for participating earlier.

1806
03:17:10,060 --> 03:17:14,380
Now, we collaborated earlier in one repository.

1807
03:17:14,380 --> 03:17:24,620
And you know how to create an issue and pull a pull request

1808
03:17:24,620 --> 03:17:26,900
and how to record a new code review.

1809
03:17:26,900 --> 03:17:29,060
Do you want to comment on anything on that, Sabdee,

1810
03:17:29,060 --> 03:17:32,580
before we go for the next session?

1811
03:17:32,580 --> 03:17:34,620
No, I think it's all good.

1812
03:17:34,620 --> 03:17:37,620
Some questions are answered.

1813
03:17:37,620 --> 03:17:39,980
I think we can go for the next one.

1814
03:17:39,980 --> 03:17:46,980
So now we are going to contribute changes to a repository that belongs to others.

1815
03:17:46,980 --> 03:17:50,980
Earlier you had write access to the repository where you contributed,

1816
03:17:50,980 --> 03:17:57,980
and now there are many, many open source repositories that you might use,

1817
03:17:57,980 --> 03:18:00,980
and you might find some bugs or some improvement,

1818
03:18:00,980 --> 03:18:02,980
and you are not a member.

1819
03:18:02,980 --> 03:18:06,980
You don't have write access, and you want to contribute, and how to do that.

1820
03:18:06,980 --> 03:18:12,740
That's what we are going to see, and [name] will mention the exercise setup before we

1821
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:22,420
go for the exercise, but I just want to show you how, given initial thoughts on it, how

1822
03:18:22,420 --> 03:18:23,420
it works.

1823
03:18:23,420 --> 03:18:29,340
I will go to my repositories, and you can see that I have a lot of fork.

1824
03:18:29,340 --> 03:18:38,660
So when you want to contribute to someone's repository where you don't have to access,

1825
03:18:38,660 --> 03:18:44,020
you don't have the access, somebody mentioned that you fork into your namespace.

1826
03:18:44,020 --> 03:18:48,580
And you could see that I have many repositories which I forked.

1827
03:18:48,580 --> 03:18:52,900
I will just show you that JAX, for example.

1828
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:57,540
So, [name], you mentioned that the term namespace, what does it mean?

1829
03:18:57,540 --> 03:19:02,060
Oh, yeah, that namespace here means it's under my namespace.

1830
03:19:02,060 --> 03:19:03,060
That's a good question.

1831
03:19:03,060 --> 03:19:06,500
I shouldn't have used that new, new intents.

1832
03:19:06,500 --> 03:19:10,740
So the actual repository, that's the upstream repository,

1833
03:19:10,740 --> 03:19:14,340
is under Google's namespace, I would say.

1834
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:19,580
But when I fork it, it's under my namespace.

1835
03:19:19,580 --> 03:19:22,340
Does that answer your question?

1836
03:19:22,340 --> 03:19:25,260
Yes, so this is a copy of what Google has,

1837
03:19:25,260 --> 03:19:27,220
but it's in your repository.

1838
03:19:27,220 --> 03:19:29,580
You can edit and do whatever you want,

1839
03:19:29,580 --> 03:19:33,580
but the Google will not see it unless you explicitly ask.

1840
03:19:33,580 --> 03:19:34,460
Yes.

1841
03:19:34,460 --> 03:19:38,460
And I just want to show you that this is what you see.

1842
03:19:38,460 --> 03:19:40,020
That's what I forked.

1843
03:19:40,020 --> 03:19:44,340
And you could see that I forked from Google Jax.

1844
03:19:44,340 --> 03:19:47,100
And if I want to contribute, what should I do?

1845
03:19:47,100 --> 03:19:53,500
And I will go to this Google Jax, the original repository.

1846
03:19:53,500 --> 03:19:55,580
And there are issues.

1847
03:19:55,580 --> 03:19:57,140
You could see many issues.

1848
03:19:57,140 --> 03:20:04,980
and it's an open repository, and I created just like what we did when we were collaborating.

1849
03:20:07,220 --> 03:20:13,700
So, this is what we are going to do and how to do it. We will have this exercise set up

1850
03:20:16,100 --> 03:20:19,140
and we will fork it from our code refinery,

1851
03:20:19,140 --> 03:20:24,820
a forking-recorded repository and we'll work on it.

1852
03:20:24,820 --> 03:20:27,220
Where you don't have any write access,

1853
03:20:27,220 --> 03:20:29,140
you will fork it and make changes

1854
03:20:29,140 --> 03:20:34,700
and make a pull request to us the upstream repository.

1855
03:20:34,700 --> 03:20:38,220
Upstream means the original repository where you fork from.

1856
03:20:38,220 --> 03:20:41,300
Is there something you want to add on that subject,

1857
03:20:41,300 --> 03:20:50,300
that the motivation, or are you muted?

1858
03:20:50,300 --> 03:20:51,260
Can you hear me?

1859
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:55,260
Sorry, I just lost my sound a little bit.

1860
03:20:55,260 --> 03:20:56,900
What were you asking?

1861
03:20:56,900 --> 03:20:58,820
Is there anything you want to add on it

1862
03:20:58,820 --> 03:21:02,820
about the motivation of something?

1863
03:21:02,820 --> 03:21:03,580
Not necessarily.

1864
03:21:03,580 --> 03:21:05,100
I think you explained it.

1865
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:07,900
It's just that you can't edit because you are not

1866
03:21:07,900 --> 03:21:09,500
part of that organization.

1867
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:14,420
And it's unlikely that unless you are a heavy contributor

1868
03:21:14,420 --> 03:21:18,300
that you become a part of that organization.

1869
03:21:18,300 --> 03:21:22,740
And you don't have to be part of Google in order to contribute.

1870
03:21:22,740 --> 03:21:25,020
I mean, not contribute, suggest contributions.

1871
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:28,700
So I think you made yourself clear.

1872
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:29,460
Yeah.

1873
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:35,620
And you could find about all this, your repository

1874
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:38,540
and your teams under your namespace,

1875
03:21:38,540 --> 03:21:48,060
which organization you are part of. I'm not part of many on GitHub. You could see which

1876
03:21:48,060 --> 03:21:55,900
organization you are part of. But what we are going to do is we are going to contribute

1877
03:21:55,900 --> 03:22:01,820
some changes to a repository. We don't have write access. You can read the repository,

1878
03:22:01,820 --> 03:22:06,140
but you want to suggest some changes,

1879
03:22:06,140 --> 03:22:09,740
and the maintainer or admin of the repository

1880
03:22:09,740 --> 03:22:11,180
will review the changes.

1881
03:22:12,140 --> 03:22:13,500
That's we are going to practice.

1882
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:16,300
And this is the way that open source software

1883
03:22:16,300 --> 03:22:17,580
developed so much.

1884
03:22:17,580 --> 03:22:23,260
So this is something we always want to contribute back

1885
03:22:23,980 --> 03:22:25,340
whatever we use it.

1886
03:22:25,340 --> 03:22:27,260
Do you do that mostly, [name]?

1887
03:22:27,260 --> 03:22:37,220
I mean, I have contributed for certain projects, but you know, not much.

1888
03:22:37,220 --> 03:22:46,340
So one thing I would like to mention is that when you fork a repository, it could go stale.

1889
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:51,060
I mean, I see a lot of repositories here, maybe they are not properly synchronized with

1890
03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:52,060
the original version.

1891
03:22:52,060 --> 03:22:57,220
Yeah, that we will maybe come back or you want me to show it now how to synchronize

1892
03:22:57,220 --> 03:23:01,820
with my original upstream repository or?

1893
03:23:01,820 --> 03:23:06,220
Yeah, yeah, maybe we can show that after the exercise.

1894
03:23:06,220 --> 03:23:07,700
Okay, yeah.

1895
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:10,140
You will see that if it is on sync or not.

1896
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:14,140
So you can see that I didn't look

1897
03:23:14,140 --> 03:23:19,140
into it for a long time, so I'm 794 commits behind.

1898
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:24,020
But this is the option, you can sync fork,

1899
03:23:24,020 --> 03:23:29,580
But [name] will show you later when we do the exercise.

1900
03:23:29,580 --> 03:23:33,220
Shall we go for the preparation for the exercise?

1901
03:23:33,220 --> 03:23:35,860
Or do we have any questions to take before that?

1902
03:23:39,380 --> 03:23:43,140
So there's this question about why fork instead of cloning.

1903
03:23:43,140 --> 03:23:47,340
Maybe we can touch that a little bit.

1904
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:55,140
So a cloning will involve even if you fork.

1905
03:23:55,140 --> 03:24:02,580
So if you clone directly from this Google's JAX repository,

1906
03:24:02,580 --> 03:24:04,340
you can make changes locally.

1907
03:24:04,340 --> 03:24:09,820
But you can't send your changes back to Google,

1908
03:24:09,820 --> 03:24:13,380
because then it will be rejected,

1909
03:24:13,380 --> 03:24:15,660
which will say that you don't have right access.

1910
03:24:15,660 --> 03:24:17,980
Because you are not a collaborator there.

1911
03:24:17,980 --> 03:24:18,480
Yes.

1912
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:20,460
In the teaching material, we have some screenshots

1913
03:24:20,460 --> 03:24:23,420
of what exact message you get.

1914
03:24:23,420 --> 03:24:26,140
Because of that, you should make a copy in the cloud itself.

1915
03:24:26,140 --> 03:24:32,220
You fork it in your namespace, and then clone it, and make

1916
03:24:32,220 --> 03:24:35,300
your modification, and send the pull request via the fork.

1917
03:24:38,940 --> 03:24:42,020
OK, shall we go to the preparation of the exercise?

1918
03:24:42,020 --> 03:24:44,660
And shall we have our hands on it?

1919
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:48,860
Yes, so I think we should go for the exercise.

1920
03:24:48,860 --> 03:24:49,740
I could explain that.

1921
03:24:49,740 --> 03:24:52,260
And I have a slight problem with the sound.

1922
03:24:52,260 --> 03:24:56,780
Maybe if I lose my voice a little bit,

1923
03:24:56,780 --> 03:25:00,740
you might have to explain if you don't hear me.

1924
03:25:00,740 --> 03:25:04,980
I'm going to start sharing the screen.

1925
03:25:04,980 --> 03:25:05,980
You could stop.

1926
03:25:05,980 --> 03:25:08,500
Then maybe my screen will show up.

1927
03:25:08,500 --> 03:25:09,500
Yes, I see that.

1928
03:25:13,220 --> 03:25:14,820
Let's see one more time the questions.

1929
03:25:14,820 --> 03:25:17,980
Just please keep the questions coming.

1930
03:25:17,980 --> 03:25:26,260
And we are in this, let me go up very slowly, this we did.

1931
03:25:26,260 --> 03:25:30,580
And we move on to this lesson called

1932
03:25:30,580 --> 03:25:32,980
how to contribute changes to repositories

1933
03:25:32,980 --> 03:25:35,820
that belong to others.

1934
03:25:35,820 --> 03:25:38,700
So if others give you permission, that's fine.

1935
03:25:38,700 --> 03:25:43,420
But this is how you would contribute when you are not

1936
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:45,900
part of that organization.

1937
03:25:45,900 --> 03:25:47,940
As with the previous exercise, there

1938
03:25:47,940 --> 03:25:51,340
are two main workflows here.

1939
03:25:51,340 --> 03:25:54,500
The first workflow is that you are part of a team.

1940
03:25:54,500 --> 03:25:57,460
As before, you are in a group somewhere,

1941
03:25:57,460 --> 03:26:04,340
and you have a team leader who will provide this repository

1942
03:26:04,340 --> 03:26:06,620
for you, created from our template,

1943
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:11,860
and you will follow that instructions from your team.

1944
03:26:11,860 --> 03:26:14,100
The other instruction is that you don't have a team,

1945
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:17,020
you're on your own, and you'll be in our team,

1946
03:26:17,020 --> 03:26:19,460
me, [name], and the code refinement

1947
03:26:19,460 --> 03:26:20,660
that we are going to show.

1948
03:26:20,660 --> 03:26:22,740
So we have created that repository.

1949
03:26:22,740 --> 03:26:26,700
It's called the, if you click this link,

1950
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:30,740
you'll land in that repository.

1951
03:26:30,740 --> 03:26:34,260
Workflow exercises, I actually need

1952
03:26:34,260 --> 03:26:43,680
to show the one that is not recorded.

1953
03:26:43,680 --> 03:26:45,640
Central logs for recorded.

1954
03:26:45,640 --> 03:26:48,720
OK, so I had to show the one that is recorded.

1955
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:50,680
The difference between the recorded one

1956
03:26:50,680 --> 03:26:52,160
and the non-recorded one, as before,

1957
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:55,480
is that the recorded one will show up in our recordings.

1958
03:26:55,480 --> 03:26:58,000
So if you don't want your names appear here,

1959
03:26:58,000 --> 03:26:59,480
you should use this one.

1960
03:26:59,480 --> 03:27:04,480
So you will land in this report.

1961
03:27:08,560 --> 03:27:13,560
So as before, we have like two main workflows

1962
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:16,320
and how this works.

1963
03:27:16,320 --> 03:27:17,920
And even in that workflow,

1964
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:19,680
we have like three ways of working.

1965
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:22,800
So one is that you have your team,

1966
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:27,280
your team leader provides this report to fork from

1967
03:27:27,280 --> 03:27:29,200
and you fork from that

1968
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:31,520
and you contribute, and you're on your own,

1969
03:27:31,520 --> 03:27:32,840
you're following code refinery,

1970
03:27:32,840 --> 03:27:36,680
you know, the fork that the report we created for you,

1971
03:27:36,680 --> 03:27:37,880
you fork from that.

1972
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:42,640
If it's okay for you to show up your name in our recordings,

1973
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:47,640
you can use the report that ends with the recorded.

1974
03:27:49,240 --> 03:27:51,920
And if you don't want your name to show up,

1975
03:27:51,920 --> 03:27:56,240
you should the one which does not have recorded at the end.

1976
03:27:56,240 --> 03:27:58,040
You should use only one.

1977
03:27:58,040 --> 03:28:01,700
And you could select and follow that procedure.

1978
03:28:04,400 --> 03:28:09,400
And then, so the idea is that you would be provided

1979
03:28:16,040 --> 03:28:18,480
with this repo that you would fork,

1980
03:28:18,480 --> 03:28:21,320
you would make a copy in the cloud,

1981
03:28:21,320 --> 03:28:26,320
but inside your own workspace or namespace.

1982
03:28:26,320 --> 03:28:30,600
And then what will happen is after you create that,

1983
03:28:30,600 --> 03:28:33,960
you're going to contribute back something.

1984
03:28:33,960 --> 03:28:37,000
Before you contribute back, as we discussed before,

1985
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:40,080
you should open an issue and inform the developers

1986
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:41,280
that you're going to do that.

1987
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:45,200
So [name], the issue, do we create the issue

1988
03:28:45,200 --> 03:28:50,120
in the organization repo, or do I create it

1989
03:28:50,120 --> 03:28:52,240
in the fork that I created?

1990
03:28:52,240 --> 03:28:54,520
The upstream organization repository.

1991
03:28:54,520 --> 03:28:58,640
That's where you are telling that there is some improvement

1992
03:28:58,640 --> 03:29:02,240
or issues that you want to, or you can mention,

1993
03:29:02,240 --> 03:29:03,520
as I mentioned it earlier,

1994
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:06,800
that issues on this open repository,

1995
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:11,200
you can create it even though you are not working on it.

1996
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:14,600
And it would be always on the upstream repository.

1997
03:29:14,600 --> 03:29:16,120
You need to create the issues

1998
03:29:16,120 --> 03:29:21,120
if you want to contribute back to changes to this,

1999
03:29:21,360 --> 03:29:23,200
like for example, JAX.

2000
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:25,320
I will go to the Google Jax.

2001
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:27,560
There, I will create an issue.

2002
03:29:27,560 --> 03:29:29,440
Yes, so you'll create the Google.

2003
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:31,840
So although you don't have access to the repo itself,

2004
03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:33,240
you can create issues.

2005
03:29:33,240 --> 03:29:34,960
So that is where the Google people will

2006
03:29:34,960 --> 03:29:36,960
say that improvement is coming.

2007
03:29:36,960 --> 03:29:39,160
Let's say you open an issue in your repo,

2008
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:41,160
they don't know about it.

2009
03:29:41,160 --> 03:29:44,320
So that communication never happens, although in the cloud.

2010
03:29:44,320 --> 03:29:45,760
Yeah, and one more thing.

2011
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:49,920
Here, you don't need to ask for the access.

2012
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:52,640
So when we were collaborating earlier,

2013
03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:57,280
we asked for access, we added your username to our team

2014
03:29:57,280 --> 03:29:59,000
and made every changes.

2015
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:01,800
So here you don't need to do that.

2016
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:04,960
Yes, so you don't need to do that.

2017
03:30:04,960 --> 03:30:09,400
So here, let's say the centralized workflow

2018
03:30:09,400 --> 03:30:11,840
recorded exercise.

2019
03:30:11,840 --> 03:30:15,560
So depending on how your screen setup is,

2020
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:19,040
not every menu will be visible.

2021
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:22,000
So there is a menu called Fork.

2022
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:27,120
Where is it?

2023
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:31,480
I can make it a little smaller and see whether it shows.

2024
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:33,720
As you can see here, I don't see it.

2025
03:30:33,720 --> 03:30:39,200
But when I zoom out, I can see this fork repository.

2026
03:30:39,200 --> 03:30:45,360
So this button, where you click depends on the pathway

2027
03:30:45,360 --> 03:30:46,920
you selected in the beginning.

2028
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:50,120
If you're in a small team, you should

2029
03:30:50,120 --> 03:30:54,240
go to that small team's repository and create fork.

2030
03:30:54,240 --> 03:30:55,640
And if you're in a code refinery,

2031
03:30:55,640 --> 03:30:58,520
and if it's OK for your name to be

2032
03:30:58,520 --> 03:31:01,280
visible in the recorded version, you could create fork.

2033
03:31:01,280 --> 03:31:03,600
So when you click the fork button,

2034
03:31:03,600 --> 03:31:05,280
you will be given an option.

2035
03:31:05,280 --> 03:31:09,680
So this is my namespace or my Git repository,

2036
03:31:09,680 --> 03:31:13,200
my organization, which I am the only member.

2037
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:14,720
And it will give this option.

2038
03:31:14,720 --> 03:31:18,560
And you could also mention that copy the main branch only.

2039
03:31:18,560 --> 03:31:20,480
You don't have to copy all the branches.

2040
03:31:20,480 --> 03:31:23,080
Usually, when you're working with copying and forking

2041
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:31,000
from a very highly active program, NumPy, or JAX,

2042
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:35,960
or PyTorch, or very active projects,

2043
03:31:35,960 --> 03:31:41,440
or maybe the Linux compiler, you don't want to copy everything.

2044
03:31:41,440 --> 03:31:46,440
It will be a huge repository with a lot of commits and all.

2045
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:49,300
So here only the main and I'll create a fork.

2046
03:31:52,020 --> 03:31:53,980
And then the fork will be created.

2047
03:31:55,480 --> 03:31:56,560
So you should do that.

2048
03:31:56,560 --> 03:32:00,600
So after the fork created, the workflow is as before.

2049
03:32:00,600 --> 03:32:04,500
Now you clone from the copy you made,

2050
03:32:04,500 --> 03:32:05,860
not from the original one.

2051
03:32:05,860 --> 03:32:10,860
So the one that creates under your name.

2052
03:32:11,440 --> 03:32:15,160
You create a fork.

2053
03:32:15,160 --> 03:32:17,080
Then you clone it, or you could, if you

2054
03:32:17,080 --> 03:32:19,520
want to edit in the GitHub itself, you can edit TASL.

2055
03:32:19,520 --> 03:32:23,720
Or if you want to clone it to your local terminal,

2056
03:32:23,720 --> 03:32:25,280
then you clone it.

2057
03:32:25,280 --> 03:32:28,400
Then you would create a branch.

2058
03:32:28,400 --> 03:32:31,000
And then you make the change, or the suggestion,

2059
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:32,840
or the improvement.

2060
03:32:32,840 --> 03:32:38,800
And then you will add that to that new branch.

2061
03:32:38,800 --> 03:32:40,240
And then you will commit.

2062
03:32:40,240 --> 03:32:42,840
When you're committing, you can mention the issue as before.

2063
03:32:42,840 --> 03:32:45,000
But this time, you are mentioning

2064
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,640
an issue which is not in the repository

2065
03:32:47,640 --> 03:32:50,680
that you are pushing to first.

2066
03:32:50,680 --> 03:32:54,080
So you are referring to an issue that's upstream,

2067
03:32:54,080 --> 03:32:58,160
which means this issue is not something in your repository,

2068
03:32:58,160 --> 03:33:05,320
but it will make sense when we merge it or accept

2069
03:33:05,320 --> 03:33:10,080
the full request in the original repository.

2070
03:33:10,080 --> 03:33:13,120
And yes?

2071
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:15,600
These are the steps you want to mention, [name]?

2072
03:33:15,600 --> 03:33:19,760
Yes, so I think this is very clearly written

2073
03:33:19,760 --> 03:33:20,800
what you should do.

2074
03:33:20,800 --> 03:33:23,800
And if you get in trouble, and error messages

2075
03:33:23,800 --> 03:33:27,720
are also like anticipated error messages are here.

2076
03:33:27,720 --> 03:33:36,080
And let's say that something goes wrong.

2077
03:33:36,080 --> 03:33:41,080
For example, you copied, instead of copying the fork

2078
03:33:41,760 --> 03:33:44,480
you made, you accidentally copied the original one

2079
03:33:44,480 --> 03:33:49,040
from your team leader, what the team leader created,

2080
03:33:49,040 --> 03:33:54,040
or you directly clone the repo that CodeRefinery created.

2081
03:33:54,480 --> 03:33:58,640
If that happens, this recovery box tells you

2082
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:01,120
how to fix that.

2083
03:34:01,120 --> 03:34:01,960
Yep.

2084
03:34:02,800 --> 03:34:05,000
And then as before, the pull request,

2085
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:07,840
you have to request the pull request.

2086
03:34:07,840 --> 03:34:11,400
So this time, you would select,

2087
03:34:11,400 --> 03:34:14,560
you have to make sure that when the pull request is made,

2088
03:34:16,080 --> 03:34:19,540
that it's going from your repository,

2089
03:34:19,540 --> 03:34:24,540
your repository that you have the changes to somewhere else.

2090
03:34:27,240 --> 03:34:30,080
So this arrow would point, there's a small arrow here,

2091
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:34,140
if you notice closely, it will show you where it's going.

2092
03:34:34,140 --> 03:34:38,300
So you have to make sure that it happens that way.

2093
03:34:38,300 --> 03:34:41,220
And then I think, without we spend too much time,

2094
03:34:41,220 --> 03:34:47,940
[name], because it's everything explained very well here,

2095
03:34:47,940 --> 03:34:49,660
we will go over the exercise now.

2096
03:34:49,660 --> 03:34:51,420
Yeah, before we go to exercise, I

2097
03:34:51,420 --> 03:34:54,660
would like to take one very interesting question, 36,

2098
03:34:54,660 --> 03:34:58,580
about the difference between issue and pull request.

2099
03:34:58,580 --> 03:35:07,820
So an issue is like a discussion thread.

2100
03:35:07,820 --> 03:35:09,780
So you discuss things.

2101
03:35:09,780 --> 03:35:12,220
The pull request itself is the change.

2102
03:35:12,220 --> 03:35:14,700
So you discuss about a change in the issue,

2103
03:35:14,700 --> 03:35:18,460
and then you send the actual change.

2104
03:35:18,460 --> 03:35:20,060
So that is the difference.

2105
03:35:20,060 --> 03:35:20,740
Yeah.

2106
03:35:20,740 --> 03:35:24,860
And if I can add issues as something,

2107
03:35:24,860 --> 03:35:32,940
can inform that there is something that can be improved. It's not always to be in discussion.

2108
03:35:32,940 --> 03:35:39,660
Sometimes you can mention there is something going on and you are going to work on it. But

2109
03:35:39,660 --> 03:35:48,220
there is no changes. It's only part of the initiation about these changes and you can

2110
03:35:49,180 --> 03:35:53,580
have some feedback, some other colleagues or someone from the organization itself.

2111
03:35:53,580 --> 03:36:04,580
And the pull request is the changes that you ask the maintainer to pull the changes from your suggestion.

2112
03:36:04,580 --> 03:36:16,580
So this question, question 37, it's asked what is the difference between if you just say quick push or like you be more specific git push upstream origin branch name.

2113
03:36:16,580 --> 03:36:19,460
So this also depends on the configuration

2114
03:36:19,460 --> 03:36:20,540
that you have in your Git.

2115
03:36:20,540 --> 03:36:21,780
So you have this Git config.

2116
03:36:21,780 --> 03:36:24,620
I think you learned it in the first few days.

2117
03:36:24,620 --> 03:36:28,260
That if you had configured default branches,

2118
03:36:28,260 --> 03:36:31,660
et cetera, et cetera, Git push will just

2119
03:36:31,660 --> 03:36:38,340
push everything to Git, what you have in the branch you are in.

2120
03:36:38,340 --> 03:36:41,580
But if you are more specific, it will

2121
03:36:41,580 --> 03:36:51,580
push the exactly, the branch that is connected in the remote and yours. So you're specifying

2122
03:36:51,580 --> 03:36:59,580
push exactly from here to exactly to there. So I always use this exact commands, not generate

2123
03:36:59,580 --> 03:37:10,740
git push, because sometimes when you're in a wrong branch or like, it's always make life

2124
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:14,660
easier and less error prone when you're more specific in Git.

2125
03:37:14,660 --> 03:37:17,180
But you could, of course, configure your Git

2126
03:37:17,180 --> 03:37:20,140
to understand when you say Git push do this.

2127
03:37:20,140 --> 03:37:21,980
But I would recommend be specific,

2128
03:37:21,980 --> 03:37:25,700
and then you would exactly know what you are expecting,

2129
03:37:25,700 --> 03:37:30,540
and Git would understand it as it is.

2130
03:37:30,540 --> 03:37:33,380
So now, Darya, is there anything else you want to mention?

2131
03:37:33,380 --> 03:37:37,380
No, maybe we can go to exercise and come back and discuss

2132
03:37:37,380 --> 03:37:39,060
a little bit more on this.

2133
03:37:39,060 --> 03:37:40,260
Yes.

2134
03:37:40,260 --> 03:37:42,140
So the difference between last time and this time

2135
03:37:42,140 --> 03:37:44,740
is you first fork and then clone.

2136
03:37:44,740 --> 03:37:46,860
Everything else is almost the same.

2137
03:37:46,860 --> 03:37:49,940
And the issue is created in the original upstream repository,

2138
03:37:49,940 --> 03:37:53,020
not the one you copied.

2139
03:37:53,020 --> 03:37:54,820
How long do we have for the exercise, [name]?

2140
03:37:54,820 --> 03:37:56,540
Was it 15 or?

2141
03:37:56,540 --> 03:38:01,620
25 minutes, or maybe we could give it 22 minutes,

2142
03:38:01,620 --> 03:38:05,060
45 minutes past the hour.

2143
03:38:05,060 --> 03:38:05,860
We can come back.

2144
03:38:05,860 --> 03:38:09,180
OK, 45 past on the hour, we'll be back at 8.

2145
03:38:09,180 --> 03:38:11,780
So we'll be muting our microphones

2146
03:38:11,780 --> 03:38:15,900
and go back in your exercise and tell us

2147
03:38:15,900 --> 03:38:20,700
if you face any problem and also keep on asking questions.

2148
03:38:20,700 --> 03:38:22,420
Good luck.

2149
03:38:39,180 --> 03:38:41,240
you

2150
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:11,240
you

2151
03:39:39,180 --> 03:39:41,240
you

2152
03:40:09,180 --> 03:40:11,240
you

2153
03:40:39,180 --> 03:40:41,240
you

2154
03:41:09,180 --> 03:41:11,240
you

2155
03:41:39,180 --> 03:41:41,240
you

2156
03:42:09,180 --> 03:42:11,240
you

2157
03:42:39,180 --> 03:42:41,240
you

2158
03:43:09,180 --> 03:43:11,240
you

2159
03:43:39,180 --> 03:43:41,240
you

2160
03:44:09,180 --> 03:44:11,240
you

2161
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:41,240
you

2162
03:45:09,180 --> 03:45:11,240
you

2163
03:45:39,180 --> 03:45:41,240
you

2164
03:46:09,180 --> 03:46:11,240
you

2165
03:46:39,180 --> 03:46:41,240
you

2166
03:47:09,180 --> 03:47:11,240
you

2167
03:47:39,180 --> 03:47:41,240
you

2168
03:48:09,180 --> 03:48:11,240
you

2169
03:48:39,180 --> 03:48:41,240
you

2170
03:49:09,180 --> 03:49:11,240
you

2171
03:49:39,180 --> 03:49:41,240
you

2172
03:50:09,180 --> 03:50:11,240
you

2173
03:50:39,180 --> 03:50:41,240
you

2174
03:51:09,180 --> 03:51:11,240
you

2175
03:51:39,180 --> 03:51:41,240
you

2176
03:52:09,180 --> 03:52:11,240
you

2177
03:52:39,180 --> 03:52:41,240
you

2178
03:53:09,180 --> 03:53:11,240
you

2179
03:53:39,180 --> 03:53:41,240
you

2180
03:54:09,180 --> 03:54:11,240
you

2181
03:54:39,180 --> 03:54:41,240
you

2182
03:55:09,180 --> 03:55:11,240
you

2183
03:55:39,180 --> 03:55:41,240
you

2184
03:56:09,180 --> 03:56:11,240
you

2185
03:56:39,180 --> 03:56:41,240
you

2186
03:57:09,180 --> 03:57:11,240
you

2187
03:57:39,180 --> 03:57:41,240
you

2188
03:58:09,180 --> 03:58:11,240
you

2189
03:58:39,180 --> 03:58:41,240
you

2190
03:59:09,180 --> 03:59:36,220
Okay, I hope you had the time to do the exercise and if you need a little bit more time, you

2191
03:59:36,220 --> 03:59:40,020
can indicate here on our notes.

2192
03:59:40,020 --> 03:59:45,260
[name], shall we go through it, how we were working on it?

2193
03:59:45,260 --> 03:59:50,180
Yes, if you could show how you send the pull request

2194
03:59:50,180 --> 03:59:53,740
with the correct branch, from correct branch to the task,

2195
03:59:53,740 --> 03:59:55,140
correct target branch.

2196
03:59:55,140 --> 03:59:57,260
Yes, I can show that, and then you

2197
03:59:57,260 --> 04:00:01,620
can see how my pull request is.

2198
04:00:01,620 --> 04:00:06,180
So I am on the upstream repository

2199
04:00:06,180 --> 04:00:08,340
forking workflow exercise recorder,

2200
04:00:08,340 --> 04:00:11,580
and I am listing out the issues,

2201
04:00:11,580 --> 04:00:16,060
and you see I have two issues listed out.

2202
04:00:16,060 --> 04:00:17,140
And one of the issue,

2203
04:00:17,140 --> 04:00:19,660
there is a pull request already linked to it.

2204
04:00:19,660 --> 04:00:22,660
And here, this is the other one,

2205
04:00:22,660 --> 04:00:24,100
the other issue I am working on.

2206
04:00:24,100 --> 04:00:28,820
But I forked this repository and I created branch.

2207
04:00:28,820 --> 04:00:30,700
I made some changes.

2208
04:00:30,700 --> 04:00:34,700
Now I want to open a pull request.

2209
04:00:34,700 --> 04:00:38,660
Just wanted to show this, that when you open a pull request,

2210
04:00:38,660 --> 04:00:41,420
you are suggesting the changes

2211
04:00:41,420 --> 04:00:44,160
towards the upstream repository.

2212
04:00:44,160 --> 04:00:47,780
So if you are trying to open a pull request,

2213
04:00:47,780 --> 04:00:49,220
you see the base repository,

2214
04:00:49,220 --> 04:00:52,520
see our workshop exercise and base main,

2215
04:00:52,520 --> 04:00:54,780
and head, this is my namespace

2216
04:00:54,780 --> 04:00:59,780
and the branch I created for this changes I suggest.

2217
04:01:00,700 --> 04:01:05,700
So what it do is it will create a pull request

2218
04:01:06,460 --> 04:01:11,460
on the upstream repository where you forked your copy.

2219
04:01:12,580 --> 04:01:14,260
This is, I want to show this.

2220
04:01:14,260 --> 04:01:16,780
When you pull request, you just check it.

2221
04:01:16,780 --> 04:01:19,300
It is doing on the right path.

2222
04:01:20,940 --> 04:01:23,640
And you create a pull request.

2223
04:01:23,640 --> 04:01:26,180
Before that, allow edits by maintenance.

2224
04:01:26,180 --> 04:01:36,300
That means the maintainers can edit on your change suggestions

2225
04:01:36,300 --> 04:01:37,580
on your branch.

2226
04:01:37,580 --> 04:01:42,500
I would like to add [name] as the reviewer,

2227
04:01:42,500 --> 04:01:47,020
so I can ask for review from [name] here

2228
04:01:47,020 --> 04:01:49,020
and create a pull request.

2229
04:01:49,020 --> 04:01:59,460
So it's create a pull request on the upstream repository

2230
04:01:59,460 --> 04:02:01,140
where we fork from.

2231
04:02:01,140 --> 04:02:03,380
Shall we go to the pull request?

2232
04:02:03,380 --> 04:02:06,060
And I see that there are a lot of pull requests.

2233
04:02:06,060 --> 04:02:08,220
Ravi, you want to take over the screen

2234
04:02:08,220 --> 04:02:14,220
and review my pull request and others?

2235
04:02:14,220 --> 04:02:16,580
Yes, I'm going to start sharing.

2236
04:02:16,580 --> 04:02:20,540
Yeah, all good?

2237
04:02:20,540 --> 04:02:22,900
Yeah.

2238
04:02:22,900 --> 04:02:24,060
Then you could stop.

2239
04:02:24,060 --> 04:02:25,220
Yeah, I could see it, yes.

2240
04:02:27,980 --> 04:02:32,540
So here, I see that this is the centralized workflow

2241
04:02:32,540 --> 04:02:34,340
and the recorded version of the exercise

2242
04:02:34,340 --> 04:02:37,540
that we are going to share with you.

2243
04:02:37,540 --> 04:02:45,420
And let's see the issues a little bit first.

2244
04:02:46,580 --> 04:02:50,580
So I have a full request.

2245
04:02:50,580 --> 04:02:51,580
Okay.

2246
04:02:51,580 --> 04:03:00,660
Yeah, you are on the under your namespace, you are on the forked repository, so you don't

2247
04:03:00,660 --> 04:03:03,340
see the issues issue label there.

2248
04:03:03,340 --> 04:03:04,340
Yes.

2249
04:03:04,340 --> 04:03:10,460
So, when you when you forked it and if you want to see the full request and the issues

2250
04:03:10,460 --> 04:03:11,460
it will not be there.

2251
04:03:11,460 --> 04:03:17,660
to go to the place where I poked it from,

2252
04:03:17,660 --> 04:03:21,180
which we call upstream, right?

2253
04:03:21,180 --> 04:03:22,780
I go there.

2254
04:03:22,780 --> 04:03:24,340
And now I see some issues.

2255
04:03:24,340 --> 04:03:27,260
There's one issue.

2256
04:03:27,260 --> 04:03:31,540
You are showing the template.

2257
04:03:31,540 --> 04:03:32,860
Correct.

2258
04:03:32,860 --> 04:03:35,100
OK, so that's also a good point, actually.

2259
04:03:35,100 --> 04:03:42,180
So we created this repository from a template.

2260
04:03:42,180 --> 04:03:47,300
And from that template, I made a fork.

2261
04:03:47,300 --> 04:03:49,220
So I went two steps back.

2262
04:03:49,220 --> 04:03:51,620
So I should have stopped here.

2263
04:03:51,620 --> 04:03:54,500
So this is the place that I should have stopped.

2264
04:03:54,500 --> 04:03:56,180
And then I'll go to the issues.

2265
04:03:56,180 --> 04:04:06,180
So, do I have an issue by you or maybe closed?

2266
04:04:06,180 --> 04:04:08,180
You are in the wrong repository, [name].

2267
04:04:08,180 --> 04:04:10,180
You are centralized workflow exercise.

2268
04:04:10,180 --> 04:04:13,180
We are doing forking workflow exercise.

2269
04:04:13,180 --> 04:04:16,180
You are correct. Thank you, [name].

2270
04:04:16,180 --> 04:04:22,180
Forking workflow exercise recorded.

2271
04:04:22,180 --> 04:04:24,180
Now it looks correct?

2272
04:04:24,180 --> 04:04:25,180
Yes.

2273
04:04:25,180 --> 04:04:27,380
So maybe too much lunch.

2274
04:04:30,340 --> 04:04:32,700
Here, let me search [name]'s,

2275
04:04:35,300 --> 04:04:36,620
maybe I can find it.

2276
04:04:36,620 --> 04:04:38,680
No, maybe your username is,

2277
04:04:43,900 --> 04:04:45,340
okay, let's see again.

2278
04:04:45,340 --> 04:04:47,220
Do you remember your issue number?

2279
04:04:47,220 --> 04:04:52,220
Yeah, but what you see that you should be notified

2280
04:04:52,460 --> 04:04:53,940
when I create a review request,

2281
04:04:53,940 --> 04:04:56,740
but you can number seven.

2282
04:04:57,780 --> 04:05:00,020
Yes, so let me search again

2283
04:05:00,020 --> 04:05:02,720
because I think maybe I've wrongly spelled your name.

2284
04:05:06,100 --> 04:05:07,180
Let's see like this.

2285
04:05:08,100 --> 04:05:10,580
I think when you filter,

2286
04:05:10,580 --> 04:05:14,260
you have to filter with order or something like that.

2287
04:05:14,260 --> 04:05:16,100
So that's what I was thinking.

2288
04:05:16,100 --> 04:05:17,460
Okay, let's try that again.

2289
04:05:18,780 --> 04:05:21,700
Let's just copy your name exactly it is.

2290
04:05:23,940 --> 04:05:34,940
So if you if you click on the order down.

2291
04:05:34,940 --> 04:05:35,940
Yeah.

2292
04:05:35,940 --> 04:05:38,940
Yes, you're correct.

2293
04:05:38,940 --> 04:05:48,020
Then you can find. Yes. So you have two ratios. So I would, I would like you to review the

2294
04:05:48,020 --> 04:05:51,700
Chia seed pudding first, because the next, yes.

2295
04:05:51,700 --> 04:05:53,380
The next one is something interesting

2296
04:05:53,380 --> 04:05:57,340
about the workflow, GitLab action, but this one, okay.

2297
04:05:57,340 --> 04:06:01,500
So you have this Chia pudding request is number seven,

2298
04:06:02,620 --> 04:06:05,700
and you are talking about issue number eight.

2299
04:06:05,700 --> 04:06:09,380
So this issue number eight is in the upstream repository.

2300
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:14,900
Yes.

2301
04:06:14,900 --> 04:06:22,700
So then I see that you have send a pull request,

2302
04:06:22,700 --> 04:06:26,140
and then your pull request has arrived

2303
04:06:26,140 --> 04:06:29,700
into the correct place.

2304
04:06:29,700 --> 04:06:35,260
And all these green buttons look green, the checks.

2305
04:06:35,260 --> 04:06:38,100
So here, what we wanted to mention

2306
04:06:38,100 --> 04:06:42,220
is that we are also showing something that is not

2307
04:06:42,220 --> 04:06:44,660
necessarily needed to understand what we are doing

2308
04:06:44,660 --> 04:06:49,100
with this cloning, forking, merging exercise

2309
04:06:49,100 --> 04:06:51,700
is that the automated testing.

2310
04:06:51,700 --> 04:06:56,700
So there are some tests that go through.

2311
04:06:56,700 --> 04:07:04,620
So when someone sends a pull request or makes a commit,

2312
04:07:04,620 --> 04:07:09,700
you could check whether it's as expected.

2313
04:07:09,700 --> 04:07:11,900
So you could do it at commit level,

2314
04:07:11,900 --> 04:07:16,660
or you could do it at merge or pull request level.

2315
04:07:16,660 --> 04:07:18,380
So time to time, I miss this word.

2316
04:07:18,380 --> 04:07:20,140
I mix this word merge and pull request

2317
04:07:20,140 --> 04:07:22,540
because I mostly work on GitLab.

2318
04:07:22,540 --> 04:07:26,740
So we use the word merge request there a lot.

2319
04:07:26,740 --> 04:07:28,900
So the pull request, when we send that,

2320
04:07:28,900 --> 04:07:30,620
you could run the test as well.

2321
04:07:30,620 --> 04:07:37,100
So what happens is your code get checked by a script.

2322
04:07:37,100 --> 04:07:41,780
So the GitHub can spin up like a virtual machine

2323
04:07:41,780 --> 04:07:46,780
with a container and it'll run some scripts to check

2324
04:07:47,540 --> 04:07:48,980
what you have submitted.

2325
04:07:48,980 --> 04:07:51,780
So here, what it means is that it's all checks are good.

2326
04:07:51,780 --> 04:07:53,940
So I'll go and check the change file.

2327
04:07:53,940 --> 04:07:55,260
So it is a new ingredient.

2328
04:07:55,260 --> 04:07:57,100
It looks all good.

2329
04:07:57,100 --> 04:07:58,940
Nothing extraordinary.

2330
04:08:01,020 --> 04:08:06,020
I would say, I would approve it saying it looks good.

2331
04:08:06,020 --> 04:08:11,020
what's good, thank you, and I submit that.

2332
04:08:17,260 --> 04:08:18,940
And in the pull request,

2333
04:08:18,940 --> 04:08:22,020
then I see this merge pull request button,

2334
04:08:22,020 --> 04:08:26,720
so I will merge it, confirm the merge.

2335
04:08:29,920 --> 04:08:34,140
So one check passed and it merged,

2336
04:08:34,140 --> 04:08:38,240
And your changes you made in your fork,

2337
04:08:38,240 --> 04:08:42,400
in the copy you made, is now in the main repository.

2338
04:08:42,400 --> 04:08:45,280
So as the maintainer of this repository,

2339
04:08:45,280 --> 04:08:50,240
I accepted your changes and there was no issue in that.

2340
04:08:50,240 --> 04:08:55,240
So the second one that you said,

2341
04:08:56,280 --> 04:09:00,120
was you sent two requests, so let's see.

2342
04:09:00,120 --> 04:09:00,960
Yeah.

2343
04:09:00,960 --> 04:09:01,800
It's chocolate pudding, is it?

2344
04:09:01,800 --> 04:09:02,640
It is.

2345
04:09:02,640 --> 04:09:03,880
Yeah.

2346
04:09:03,880 --> 04:09:06,640
So this one, no descriptions are not good.

2347
04:09:06,640 --> 04:09:08,940
So there should be some description here

2348
04:09:08,940 --> 04:09:11,200
and you send it and which issue

2349
04:09:11,200 --> 04:09:12,940
are you referring to this year?

2350
04:09:12,940 --> 04:09:14,120
Let's see.

2351
04:09:14,120 --> 04:09:17,160
The issue is not tracking here for some reason.

2352
04:09:17,160 --> 04:09:20,600
Let me go to the pull request and see.

2353
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:24,920
Centralized workflow exercises recorded.

2354
04:09:26,680 --> 04:09:27,920
Pull requests.

2355
04:09:29,960 --> 04:09:31,440
And authors.

2356
04:09:33,880 --> 04:09:47,720
Yeah, this one. So, this one has failed. So, we could check, you know, what has failed.

2357
04:09:47,720 --> 04:09:53,640
Where should I click to see more details on this? Do you know?

2358
04:09:53,640 --> 04:09:57,440
There is already a details button. You could check details.

2359
04:09:57,440 --> 04:09:59,960
This one? Yeah.

2360
04:09:59,960 --> 04:10:05,600
I just want to specify that this test is something

2361
04:10:05,600 --> 04:10:08,800
we included in the GitLab action.

2362
04:10:08,800 --> 04:10:11,720
You will learn how to do this mostly next week.

2363
04:10:11,720 --> 04:10:15,000
We get the automated testing episodes.

2364
04:10:15,000 --> 04:10:20,360
So this is a preview of that, how it works.

2365
04:10:20,360 --> 04:10:24,440
So in the test, usually it should print some messages

2366
04:10:24,440 --> 04:10:26,880
and it shows some log files, which should

2367
04:10:26,880 --> 04:10:29,080
indicate what was exactly wrong.

2368
04:10:29,080 --> 04:10:29,640
Let me check.

2369
04:10:29,640 --> 04:10:31,640
So there are five missing ingredients section.

2370
04:10:31,640 --> 04:10:33,220
So the ingredients section is missing.

2371
04:10:33,220 --> 04:10:35,280
So that's why it failed.

2372
04:10:35,280 --> 04:10:37,320
So let me go to the pull request again.

2373
04:10:42,400 --> 04:10:44,740
Search for that.

2374
04:10:44,740 --> 04:10:53,360
And then I'll go to the files changed here.

2375
04:10:53,360 --> 04:10:58,660
So it's showing some details.

2376
04:10:58,660 --> 04:11:01,460
I can go to the review chain.

2377
04:11:01,460 --> 04:11:03,500
Okay, no, no, not yet, not yet.

2378
04:11:03,500 --> 04:11:05,860
I had to find the heading, maybe it's,

2379
04:11:05,860 --> 04:11:09,060
maybe you forgot like a hash or something in the heading.

2380
04:11:10,420 --> 04:11:15,420
No, the check was to test if there is ingredients

2381
04:11:15,900 --> 04:11:19,740
and instructions on the files,

2382
04:11:19,740 --> 04:11:22,420
but you see that I haven't done it.

2383
04:11:22,420 --> 04:11:24,980
I said recipe to be updated.

2384
04:11:24,980 --> 04:11:28,180
Aha, so here you didn't have ingredients.

2385
04:11:28,180 --> 04:11:30,020
So I don't have any recipe.

2386
04:11:30,020 --> 04:11:34,620
I just tried to push it,

2387
04:11:34,620 --> 04:11:38,420
and this is not the way it should be,

2388
04:11:38,420 --> 04:11:40,940
because when I try to add some recipe,

2389
04:11:40,940 --> 04:11:45,420
I should add ingredients and instructions.

2390
04:11:45,420 --> 04:11:48,140
That's what we put it on the test,

2391
04:11:49,660 --> 04:11:53,180
test.check.py function, right?

2392
04:11:53,180 --> 04:11:57,100
What was the name of the test?

2393
04:11:57,100 --> 04:12:00,060
The check, I can show that in a moment.

2394
04:12:00,060 --> 04:12:03,420
So it means that it figured out that this heading is missing

2395
04:12:04,740 --> 04:12:09,740
and also the instructions heading.

2396
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:18,700
So did you have only three lines in your?

2397
04:12:18,700 --> 04:12:20,700
Yes, I had only three lines.

2398
04:12:20,700 --> 04:12:25,460
Yes, I just wanted to show this that it can be failed

2399
04:12:25,460 --> 04:12:30,460
because I didn't follow the automated testing thing.

2400
04:12:31,580 --> 04:12:34,960
So can I commit this directly to see whether it works?

2401
04:12:34,960 --> 04:12:35,800
Yeah.

2402
04:12:39,280 --> 04:12:41,240
Okay, I'm going to commit that.

2403
04:12:41,240 --> 04:12:43,400
I'll add these two lines.

2404
04:12:47,600 --> 04:12:51,160
Go to the headings.

2405
04:12:51,160 --> 04:13:02,240
So, when that happens, the pipeline will run again, and we'll go to the conversations and

2406
04:13:02,240 --> 04:13:03,840
we'll see it until it runs.

2407
04:13:03,840 --> 04:13:12,000
I think our colleague [name] is mentioning about 40, question 40, let me have a look

2408
04:13:12,000 --> 04:13:14,360
at that one first.

2409
04:13:14,360 --> 04:13:17,960
Could you explain why I have to set my fork repo as upstream

2410
04:13:17,960 --> 04:13:21,320
if I can push?

2411
04:13:21,320 --> 04:13:24,160
Current branch has no upstream branch.

2412
04:13:30,760 --> 04:13:35,820
So I think our colleagues are answering the question,

2413
04:13:35,820 --> 04:13:40,280
that one, properly.

2414
04:13:40,280 --> 04:13:44,080
So I don't see that we have to explain it much here.

2415
04:13:48,160 --> 04:13:50,120
Yes.

2416
04:13:50,120 --> 04:13:52,320
So it's about Git configuration as well.

2417
04:13:52,320 --> 04:13:54,360
How you configure Git could also change.

2418
04:13:54,360 --> 04:13:57,280
But if you're very specific, if you're explicit

2419
04:13:57,280 --> 04:14:01,440
when you do push and pulls, it will be more convenient.

2420
04:14:01,440 --> 04:14:05,000
Then we'll see the check.

2421
04:14:05,000 --> 04:14:07,920
It has passed.

2422
04:14:07,920 --> 04:14:14,280
Now, how can I check back again what has changed?

2423
04:14:14,280 --> 04:14:15,480
The file changed?

2424
04:14:15,480 --> 04:14:16,680
Yeah, file changed.

2425
04:14:16,680 --> 04:14:17,400
And the commits?

2426
04:14:17,400 --> 04:14:21,920
Also, you used last time the two commits.

2427
04:14:21,920 --> 04:14:24,800
Yes, so this is my commit and this is the original one.

2428
04:14:24,800 --> 04:14:26,880
And also file changed.

2429
04:14:26,880 --> 04:14:32,880
And now it has passed the tests.

2430
04:14:32,880 --> 04:14:38,520
Then what happens is, then I could go and approve this.

2431
04:14:38,520 --> 04:14:42,640
I don't want you to approve it, because as a matter of fact,

2432
04:14:42,640 --> 04:14:44,680
there is only ingredient and instructions,

2433
04:14:44,680 --> 04:14:48,360
but there is no real recipe for the chocolate pudding.

2434
04:14:48,360 --> 04:14:52,640
But you can suggest that, can you please

2435
04:14:52,640 --> 04:14:54,880
update the recipe or something?

2436
04:14:54,880 --> 04:14:56,920
OK.

2437
04:14:56,920 --> 04:15:00,040
Yeah, but the function we want to show

2438
04:15:00,040 --> 04:15:05,040
is that there are checks we can automate.

2439
04:15:06,400 --> 04:15:11,400
So if you see that when you do a pull request

2440
04:15:12,360 --> 04:15:15,000
and all the checks are not green,

2441
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:17,560
that's something you have to check

2442
04:15:17,560 --> 04:15:21,760
that you follow all these checks updates.

2443
04:15:21,760 --> 04:15:23,560
Sometimes we use spell checker.

2444
04:15:23,560 --> 04:15:26,260
So if there is a spell error,

2445
04:15:26,260 --> 04:15:31,060
it will show spellchecker failed or something like that.

2446
04:15:31,060 --> 04:15:32,020
Yes.

2447
04:15:32,020 --> 04:15:35,300
But usually maybe it's like if you're developing Python,

2448
04:15:35,300 --> 04:15:37,220
for example, you might have PyTest

2449
04:15:37,220 --> 04:15:39,020
that you could check whether it pass.

2450
04:15:39,020 --> 04:15:41,100
Yeah.

2451
04:15:41,100 --> 04:15:47,300
Or if it's like C code, there might be checks alongside that.

2452
04:15:47,300 --> 04:15:50,620
So it will be more or less programmatic testing

2453
04:15:50,620 --> 04:15:51,980
in the real life.

2454
04:15:51,980 --> 04:15:52,480
Yeah.

2455
04:15:52,480 --> 04:15:55,020
More on to more about this next week.

2456
04:15:55,020 --> 04:15:56,780
Next week, okay.

2457
04:15:56,780 --> 04:15:59,780
So if you are curious about what Postgres is about,

2458
04:16:00,660 --> 04:16:03,820
you could go to this repository before next week.

2459
04:16:03,820 --> 04:16:07,100
You can click on this GitHub workflows

2460
04:16:08,540 --> 04:16:10,900
and then check this file.

2461
04:16:10,900 --> 04:16:13,700
What does, you know, how it is, you know, summoned.

2462
04:16:13,700 --> 04:16:17,380
How do you summon the check test to be done?

2463
04:16:17,380 --> 04:16:21,180
So it is a program that runs the check Python recipe.

2464
04:16:21,180 --> 04:16:24,660
This is how GitHub knows that it has to run it.

2465
04:16:24,660 --> 04:16:28,940
And then if you go back, you will see that file here.

2466
04:16:28,940 --> 04:16:31,820
Check recipe file, it's a Python code

2467
04:16:31,820 --> 04:16:35,620
that checks that there are certain things included.

2468
04:16:35,620 --> 04:16:37,820
Yeah, and yeah, it's-

2469
04:16:37,820 --> 04:16:42,820
Yeah, I will try to merge all the pull request,

2470
04:16:43,740 --> 04:16:47,300
but Saby, you have a forked version

2471
04:16:47,300 --> 04:16:48,820
under your namespace, right?

2472
04:16:48,820 --> 04:16:50,120
So since you pushed,

2473
04:16:51,180 --> 04:16:54,160
as you approved the pull request from my side,

2474
04:16:54,160 --> 04:16:57,240
there might be some changes in the upstream repository

2475
04:16:57,240 --> 04:17:00,400
that is not there in your forked one, right?

2476
04:17:00,400 --> 04:17:01,520
Let's check.

2477
04:17:04,240 --> 04:17:05,880
So, okay.

2478
04:17:05,880 --> 04:17:08,720
That fork, so I don't have a fork actually,

2479
04:17:08,720 --> 04:17:10,640
I have not created that one.

2480
04:17:10,640 --> 04:17:12,880
It was the centralized repository that I had a fork,

2481
04:17:12,880 --> 04:17:14,440
which I shouldn't have created.

2482
04:17:15,480 --> 04:17:17,840
I could create one actually now.

2483
04:17:17,840 --> 04:17:24,320
So after I created the fork from that repository,

2484
04:17:24,320 --> 04:17:28,800
you could merge so we could show the synchronization.

2485
04:17:28,800 --> 04:17:30,440
Now it's being created.

2486
04:17:30,440 --> 04:17:31,600
So now it's created.

2487
04:17:31,600 --> 04:17:40,080
Now it's in the, let me check the status of it.

2488
04:17:40,080 --> 04:18:00,720
Since I copied it like now at one past, it'll be in a frozen state from that place I copied.

2489
04:18:00,720 --> 04:18:04,240
Yeah, you can try to review some other pull request as well.

2490
04:18:04,240 --> 04:18:06,960
Yeah, let's do that. 4K exercise recorded.

2491
04:18:19,680 --> 04:18:22,960
Yeah, which looks good.

2492
04:18:34,240 --> 04:18:49,560
So, it failed. Let's see why it failed. Okay, it was some temporary glitch in Git. Let's

2493
04:18:49,560 --> 04:18:58,520
see again. Maybe you also tried to merge the same thing?

2494
04:18:58,520 --> 04:19:01,040
No, I merged something else.

2495
04:19:01,040 --> 04:19:03,040
So you can go to the urnamespace.

2496
04:19:03,040 --> 04:19:07,800
So you will see that your fork is not up to date

2497
04:19:07,800 --> 04:19:09,520
with the upstream repository.

2498
04:19:09,520 --> 04:19:11,160
Yeah, I think now it's OK.

2499
04:19:18,040 --> 04:19:19,040
Checks pass.

2500
04:19:19,040 --> 04:19:21,160
So now let's go to my fork.

2501
04:19:21,160 --> 04:19:24,760
So here, so these are the commits that I have.

2502
04:19:24,760 --> 04:19:25,760
Let's check the graph.

2503
04:19:29,480 --> 04:19:32,400
Traffic, code frequency, dependency graph.

2504
04:19:35,120 --> 04:19:38,200
Okay, that's not the one, commits maybe, yeah.

2505
04:19:38,200 --> 04:19:40,800
So I am here, four commits.

2506
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:44,860
Yeah, if you go to the code, it says [name].

2507
04:19:46,240 --> 04:19:47,420
Sorry, which one?

2508
04:19:47,420 --> 04:19:48,680
Yeah, now you could see

2509
04:19:48,680 --> 04:19:51,120
that this branch is four commits behind.

2510
04:19:51,120 --> 04:19:52,240
Yes, yes.

2511
04:19:52,240 --> 04:19:57,240
So if you want to sync to the upstream repository,

2512
04:19:57,240 --> 04:19:59,640
repository, what you are supposed to do?

2513
04:19:59,640 --> 04:20:00,140
Yeah.

2514
04:20:00,140 --> 04:20:00,640
Yes.

2515
04:20:00,640 --> 04:20:02,400
So I could click this button, and it'll

2516
04:20:02,400 --> 04:20:06,640
synchronize with the top button.

2517
04:20:06,640 --> 04:20:07,640
I could compare also.

2518
04:20:07,640 --> 04:20:08,800
Let's see what it shows.

2519
04:20:12,520 --> 04:20:15,720
OK, so actually, I have not made any changes.

2520
04:20:15,720 --> 04:20:18,640
So let's say if I had made some changes while that happens,

2521
04:20:18,640 --> 04:20:21,920
the synchronization might probably fail.

2522
04:20:21,920 --> 04:20:31,920
Let's go back and sync fork update branch.

2523
04:20:31,920 --> 04:20:37,920
Yeah, this branch is up to date.

2524
04:20:37,920 --> 04:20:43,920
So let's say if I had done some modifications to the main branch in my fork,

2525
04:20:43,920 --> 04:20:47,920
then it might have made some issues,

2526
04:20:47,920 --> 04:20:50,800
But it's always good practice to not

2527
04:20:50,800 --> 04:20:55,240
to do it on the main branch, but on your own branch.

2528
04:20:55,240 --> 04:20:59,720
Because once after you form, you could even

2529
04:20:59,720 --> 04:21:03,520
modify your main branch if it is not protected.

2530
04:21:06,280 --> 04:21:09,360
OK, I think those are the things we are planning to mention.

2531
04:21:09,360 --> 04:21:11,760
Maybe we can see whether there are any questions that we

2532
04:21:11,760 --> 04:21:13,560
are going to take up in the stream.

2533
04:21:13,560 --> 04:21:16,320
Yeah, and thank you for all this pull request.

2534
04:21:16,320 --> 04:21:19,560
I will try to merge it later.

2535
04:21:19,560 --> 04:21:22,040
But thank you for the active participation

2536
04:21:22,040 --> 04:21:24,440
sending pull request and creating issues.

2537
04:21:24,440 --> 04:21:30,760
And I hope you had fun while creating recipes.

2538
04:21:30,760 --> 04:21:34,480
Yes, so there are some questions about how to directly do it

2539
04:21:34,480 --> 04:21:36,360
from the command line.

2540
04:21:36,360 --> 04:21:39,800
For example, send a pull request.

2541
04:21:39,800 --> 04:21:45,040
Usually, it doesn't, with the git commands itself,

2542
04:21:45,040 --> 04:21:49,160
As far as I know, you can't do it, but you could.

2543
04:21:49,160 --> 04:21:53,400
There are APIs, we call them APIs,

2544
04:21:53,400 --> 04:21:56,480
which means that you can programmatically access Git

2545
04:21:56,480 --> 04:22:00,960
and do that if that is needed using programs like Curl

2546
04:22:00,960 --> 04:22:08,920
and Git and put instructions, but not directly Git.

2547
04:22:08,920 --> 04:22:12,200
Yeah, and maybe something I usually do

2548
04:22:12,200 --> 04:22:15,680
is I try to keep my fork up to date,

2549
04:22:15,680 --> 04:22:20,120
then pull my fork when I need to update.

2550
04:22:21,920 --> 04:22:23,440
So that's what something I do,

2551
04:22:23,440 --> 04:22:27,160
but it is maybe the optimal way someone wants to do it.

2552
04:22:28,760 --> 04:22:31,400
Yes, yeah, so keeping up to date

2553
04:22:31,400 --> 04:22:33,640
without becoming stale for a long time will help.

2554
04:22:33,640 --> 04:22:37,120
Otherwise, if you're not done any changes locally,

2555
04:22:37,120 --> 04:22:39,760
you could always update.

2556
04:22:39,760 --> 04:22:41,800
But if you're keeping on updating locally

2557
04:22:41,800 --> 04:22:47,040
without syncing, it will create a lot of conflicts.

2558
04:22:47,040 --> 04:22:51,320
And then this hash and the number, that is the trigger.

2559
04:22:51,320 --> 04:22:54,400
So you could also refer to pull requests.

2560
04:22:54,400 --> 04:23:01,400
So there are about the, there's another symbol.

2561
04:23:01,400 --> 04:23:02,280
I forgot the symbol.

2562
04:23:02,280 --> 04:23:03,620
So you could say that's at the rate,

2563
04:23:03,620 --> 04:23:04,740
and there are the symbols.

2564
04:23:04,740 --> 04:23:07,280
You can refer to other commits.

2565
04:23:07,280 --> 04:23:08,360
You can refer to pulls.

2566
04:23:08,360 --> 04:23:09,620
You can pull requests.

2567
04:23:09,620 --> 04:23:13,820
you can refer to issues.

2568
04:23:13,820 --> 04:23:16,860
There seems to be many questions discussing

2569
04:23:16,860 --> 04:23:19,700
around linking between issues and PRs.

2570
04:23:23,740 --> 04:23:32,660
So I could, again, maybe test something,

2571
04:23:32,660 --> 04:23:34,700
show something here as well.

2572
04:23:34,700 --> 04:23:40,220
So the link between the issue and the pull request

2573
04:23:40,220 --> 04:23:42,980
is the issue is where you discuss the details.

2574
04:23:42,980 --> 04:23:44,420
That is a discussion.

2575
04:23:44,420 --> 04:23:50,660
The pull request is the code that you send.

2576
04:23:50,660 --> 04:23:51,860
So that's the difference.

2577
04:23:51,860 --> 04:23:54,060
And why we are linking it is that it's

2578
04:23:54,060 --> 04:23:58,740
important to have a discussion before you suggest changes.

2579
04:23:58,740 --> 04:24:02,740
that makes things, the development pipeline

2580
04:24:02,740 --> 04:24:09,860
and the workflows less, I would say, more friendly.

2581
04:24:09,860 --> 04:24:13,140
Yeah, it is when you work with many people,

2582
04:24:13,140 --> 04:24:16,380
it's always nice to have a lot of feedback

2583
04:24:16,380 --> 04:24:18,940
and let other people know about things.

2584
04:24:18,940 --> 04:24:23,060
So having issues as a workflow is very good.

2585
04:24:23,060 --> 04:24:32,540
Yeah, apart from that, I think let's see whether any other questions or go to final colleagues

2586
04:24:32,540 --> 04:24:40,460
do is there anything more that anything very specific that we don't talk during the questions

2587
04:24:40,460 --> 04:24:42,220
the shared document.

2588
04:24:48,780 --> 04:24:50,860
Yeah, I think it's all good.

2589
04:24:53,100 --> 04:24:55,820
So we have, I think, 20 minutes left, [name], is it?

2590
04:24:55,820 --> 04:24:59,020
Yes, it was supposed to be on discussion,

2591
04:24:59,020 --> 04:25:02,060
but if there is more question to discuss it,

2592
04:25:02,060 --> 04:25:02,940
that would be nice.

2593
04:25:04,620 --> 04:25:07,260
Let's see whether there's anything we can discuss more.

2594
04:25:10,460 --> 04:25:31,460
Okay.

2595
04:25:31,460 --> 04:25:39,460
Yes.

2596
04:25:39,460 --> 04:25:42,540
Maybe we could go through the whole process again,

2597
04:25:42,540 --> 04:25:45,180
because there are some questions about the issues and all.

2598
04:25:45,180 --> 04:25:46,620
Yeah.

2599
04:25:46,620 --> 04:25:51,300
So what I will do is we have this repository forking exercise,

2600
04:25:51,300 --> 04:25:58,980
but I have a copy now of that in my namespace as well.

2601
04:25:58,980 --> 04:26:02,980
I will do it again to show what's happening.

2602
04:26:02,980 --> 04:26:09,180
So before I do that, working flow exercise recorded.

2603
04:26:09,180 --> 04:26:11,540
because I have too many tabs open,

2604
04:26:11,540 --> 04:26:13,940
I just want to make sure it's the correct one.

2605
04:26:13,940 --> 04:26:18,680
So here, I'm going to open an issue.

2606
04:26:20,140 --> 04:26:20,980
New.

2607
04:26:28,460 --> 04:26:30,340
I've got the spelling all this.

2608
04:26:34,340 --> 04:26:35,180
CP.

2609
04:26:35,180 --> 04:26:40,180
Sorry, recipe, recipe.

2610
04:26:42,740 --> 04:26:47,740
So what should I, for something.

2611
04:26:52,520 --> 04:26:56,820
Okay, so this is where things started.

2612
04:26:56,820 --> 04:27:00,120
So I went through this repo and I found out

2613
04:27:00,120 --> 04:27:03,180
that there's something I want to contribute.

2614
04:27:03,180 --> 04:27:08,100
So this is start, and I submit that issue.

2615
04:27:08,100 --> 04:27:11,100
Now, this is the original repository

2616
04:27:11,100 --> 04:27:15,580
that I copied folk from, not copied, copied folk from.

2617
04:27:15,580 --> 04:27:19,540
So then I submit new issue.

2618
04:27:19,540 --> 04:27:21,100
Now, this is the discussion.

2619
04:27:21,100 --> 04:27:24,340
And then if you could, in issue 28,

2620
04:27:24,340 --> 04:27:26,980
if you could mention something, OK, please

2621
04:27:26,980 --> 04:27:28,340
go ahead or something.

2622
04:27:33,180 --> 04:27:34,180
Done?

2623
04:27:34,180 --> 04:27:35,180
Yeah.

2624
04:27:35,180 --> 04:27:38,180
I don't see it yet.

2625
04:27:38,180 --> 04:27:41,180
Did I comment it?

2626
04:27:41,180 --> 04:27:42,180
Yes.

2627
04:27:42,180 --> 04:27:43,180
Okay.

2628
04:27:43,180 --> 04:27:46,180
Yes, that would be great.

2629
04:27:46,180 --> 04:27:48,180
Please go ahead.

2630
04:27:48,180 --> 04:27:52,180
So now I see that, you know, I should be able to see it.

2631
04:27:52,180 --> 04:27:55,300
I don't see it yet.

2632
04:27:55,300 --> 04:27:56,460
Did I comment it?

2633
04:27:56,460 --> 04:27:57,100
Did you see it?

2634
04:27:57,100 --> 04:27:58,060
Yes, OK, now I could.

2635
04:27:58,060 --> 04:28:00,260
Yes, that would be great.

2636
04:28:00,260 --> 04:28:01,380
Please go ahead.

2637
04:28:01,380 --> 04:28:04,020
So now I see that I should be working on it.

2638
04:28:04,020 --> 04:28:06,020
But there will be a longer discussion on what's

2639
04:28:06,020 --> 04:28:07,180
and what's not.

2640
04:28:07,180 --> 04:28:08,860
Now I should be going for that.

2641
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:11,220
Then I'll go to my repository.

2642
04:28:11,220 --> 04:28:15,620
I mean, the fork in my namespace.

2643
04:28:15,620 --> 04:28:19,820
I'm going to load it.

2644
04:28:19,820 --> 04:28:26,620
I could, of course, do it in the Git, on the web page as well.

2645
04:28:26,620 --> 04:28:34,020
But maybe it's easier to show the details on the terminal.

2646
04:28:34,020 --> 04:28:37,540
So I'm in my terminal.

2647
04:28:37,540 --> 04:28:42,300
Let me see where am I. So I'll go to steps.

2648
04:28:44,900 --> 04:28:45,620
Yeah.

2649
04:28:45,620 --> 04:28:47,300
So then, now it is the cloning.

2650
04:28:47,300 --> 04:28:48,500
The issue is open.

2651
04:28:48,500 --> 04:28:53,380
the forking has done.

2652
04:28:53,380 --> 04:28:55,860
Clone

2653
04:28:55,940 --> 04:28:59,380
repository. So as you can see, it is

2654
04:29:10,260 --> 04:29:13,060
cloning from my namespace not from the original place I forked from.

2655
04:29:13,060 --> 04:29:16,620
git branch.

2656
04:29:16,620 --> 04:29:20,140
And then after working on this kind of repositories,

2657
04:29:20,140 --> 04:29:28,300
especially when forked, it might be very useful to know git

2658
04:29:28,300 --> 04:29:33,700
the which remote I've actually connected to.

2659
04:29:33,700 --> 04:29:36,980
So if you type the command with remote verbose,

2660
04:29:36,980 --> 04:29:45,220
it will tell you the origin refers to the fork you made.

2661
04:29:45,220 --> 04:29:48,620
So if it is the repository that you don't have access to,

2662
04:29:48,620 --> 04:29:50,500
then you should change that.

2663
04:29:50,500 --> 04:29:51,900
So it's all good.

2664
04:29:51,900 --> 04:29:53,060
Then I'll create a branch.

2665
04:29:58,580 --> 04:30:00,340
Because I'm on the main branch, it

2666
04:30:00,340 --> 04:30:02,020
will create from the main branch.

2667
04:30:02,020 --> 04:30:05,380
Or you could specify it from what?

2668
04:30:05,380 --> 04:30:11,940
I will use my name, so I could track it easily.

2669
04:30:20,580 --> 04:30:25,300
So then I can ask again git branch, but then it will show that I am still on the

2670
04:30:27,940 --> 04:30:34,900
master branch, because I created the branch, I didn't change it. So git switch or git checkout

2671
04:30:35,380 --> 04:30:40,380
the branch, then get branch and this branch.

2672
04:30:41,620 --> 04:30:43,460
So I'm going to make the change now.

2673
04:30:45,460 --> 04:30:49,380
Let's go to the salads.

2674
04:30:50,940 --> 04:30:53,580
So I'm going to now invite a new salad.

2675
04:30:54,540 --> 04:30:56,540
I'll start from an existing one.

2676
04:31:01,940 --> 04:31:02,780
New mixed.

2677
04:31:05,380 --> 04:31:10,380
So here I will add, what could I add?

2678
04:31:18,260 --> 04:31:22,200
Yeah, some random things.

2679
04:31:28,140 --> 04:31:30,140
Four cups of oil, right?

2680
04:31:35,380 --> 04:31:44,740
Then I will save the file, and I will ask git status.

2681
04:31:44,740 --> 04:31:49,620
So that file is modified on my local computer, git is not tracking that.

2682
04:31:49,620 --> 04:31:58,660
So let's say now if you accidentally delete that file, you can't recover it.

2683
04:31:58,660 --> 04:32:09,300
I will add git new file, git add the new file, now at least the git knows it now. If it gets

2684
04:32:09,300 --> 04:32:16,260
deleted you can get it back, git commit. Now this is where the commit message comes.

2685
04:32:17,060 --> 04:32:22,100
So we are going to say that I'm going to, what I'm going to say is that the commit I'm going to make

2686
04:32:22,100 --> 04:32:30,660
is talking about this issue that we have been talking.

2687
04:32:30,660 --> 04:32:33,460
So issue number 28.

2688
04:32:33,460 --> 04:32:37,660
So when this file ends up in the main code base,

2689
04:32:37,660 --> 04:32:50,060
it will fix us this new change fixes issue number 28.

2690
04:32:52,580 --> 04:32:54,700
So now it is locally here.

2691
04:32:54,700 --> 04:32:59,180
Now if I lose my laptop or somebody steal it,

2692
04:32:59,180 --> 04:33:02,720
still it's gone, because it didn't reach the cloud.

2693
04:33:02,720 --> 04:33:07,180
So now what I want to do is to send this change

2694
04:33:07,180 --> 04:33:11,100
to the fork I made.

2695
04:33:11,100 --> 04:33:13,140
Then git status again.

2696
04:33:16,940 --> 04:33:19,940
But then I will do git push explicitly.

2697
04:33:19,940 --> 04:33:21,940
So it doesn't matter how the configurations are.

2698
04:33:21,940 --> 04:33:25,340
So I would say git push listens to the origin.

2699
04:33:25,340 --> 04:33:27,340
So what is the origin?

2700
04:33:27,340 --> 04:33:31,300
That I'm going to hash it up and stop it by executing

2701
04:33:31,300 --> 04:33:34,940
to show the origin again.

2702
04:33:34,940 --> 04:33:37,860
So the label origin refer to this URL.

2703
04:33:37,860 --> 04:33:40,420
So I could have used this URL instead.

2704
04:33:40,420 --> 04:33:44,420
So I could even use this complete URL if I want.

2705
04:33:44,420 --> 04:33:49,140
Git push origin for that URL.

2706
04:33:49,140 --> 04:33:52,140
I want to go at upstream, and I want

2707
04:33:52,140 --> 04:33:56,540
to create a name branch in my fork with the same name

2708
04:33:56,540 --> 04:33:59,180
and connect both together.

2709
04:33:59,180 --> 04:34:01,500
I'm going to change that.

2710
04:34:01,500 --> 04:34:07,940
So now this goes to my branch, right?

2711
04:34:07,940 --> 04:34:17,060
So it's here in this repository.

2712
04:34:17,060 --> 04:34:18,980
So then what happens is now this is

2713
04:34:18,980 --> 04:34:23,100
in my fork, and the main developers don't know about it.

2714
04:34:23,100 --> 04:34:25,540
So that is when we talk about the fork.

2715
04:34:25,540 --> 04:34:30,540
Now we have to send the request, which

2716
04:34:30,540 --> 04:34:34,620
we call the pool request, so the developers can integrate

2717
04:34:34,620 --> 04:34:37,580
into the main branch.

2718
04:34:37,580 --> 04:34:40,900
So did you mention all the terms, [name]?

2719
04:34:40,900 --> 04:34:42,860
Do we need to explain more?

2720
04:34:42,860 --> 04:34:47,340
Yeah, I think it is OK that we have mentioned it.

2721
04:34:47,340 --> 04:34:49,820
but if there is any questions you want to,

2722
04:34:49,820 --> 04:34:51,500
I think everything is us.

2723
04:34:51,500 --> 04:34:54,460
I'm trying to merge in between,

2724
04:34:54,460 --> 04:34:56,460
but I think that will help me.

2725
04:34:56,460 --> 04:34:59,900
And there are four more pull request.

2726
04:34:59,900 --> 04:35:01,220
One is from my side,

2727
04:35:01,220 --> 04:35:02,900
but thank you for all the pull request,

2728
04:35:02,900 --> 04:35:03,780
but we will merge it.

2729
04:35:03,780 --> 04:35:05,900
And you can try to sing your folk

2730
04:35:07,860 --> 04:35:10,300
that there are more merge is already there.

2731
04:35:14,020 --> 04:35:16,100
Is there anything we missed to,

2732
04:35:17,340 --> 04:35:30,460
anything from our colleagues? Maybe [name] or [name] wants to say the summary and ask

2733
04:35:30,460 --> 04:35:39,420
for feedback. Should we do that? We have 10 more minutes. And you can ask questions.

2734
04:35:39,420 --> 04:35:52,420
Yeah, I think we could take maybe one more question here.

2735
04:35:52,420 --> 04:36:04,420
Yeah.

2736
04:36:04,420 --> 04:36:05,260
Have a look.

2737
04:36:22,060 --> 04:36:24,420
Is there anything specific you want to take up

2738
04:36:24,420 --> 04:36:28,400
with [name] that we missed during the discussion?

2739
04:36:29,740 --> 04:36:31,540
Yeah, so sometimes it's branch creation,

2740
04:36:31,540 --> 04:36:33,980
sometimes send from the main,

2741
04:36:33,980 --> 04:36:38,100
so from the main of the home to main of the upstream,

2742
04:36:38,100 --> 04:36:40,060
it also could work,

2743
04:36:40,060 --> 04:36:43,280
but it's better to create your own brand first.

2744
04:36:47,820 --> 04:36:51,140
Okay, so please, I think it's been merged.

2745
04:36:53,300 --> 04:36:55,260
Yeah, one thing is my issue is resolved

2746
04:36:55,260 --> 04:36:56,780
and the pull request is accepted,

2747
04:36:56,780 --> 04:36:59,740
but I can't find my recipe.

2748
04:36:59,740 --> 04:37:00,740
Oh yeah.

2749
04:37:00,740 --> 04:37:05,240
Uh-huh, so that actually, you know,

2750
04:37:05,240 --> 04:37:10,240
maybe we learn git blame or git annotate at some point.

2751
04:37:12,520 --> 04:37:13,880
I think we have already done that.

2752
04:37:13,880 --> 04:37:14,720
Okay, let's see.

2753
04:37:16,480 --> 04:37:20,520
So this, in this exercise, so this is the main workflow.

2754
04:37:23,020 --> 04:37:27,800
And the file, the commits that were made.

2755
04:37:27,800 --> 04:37:42,800
Let's see if I can find those settings and whereas the list of commits, it's not there.

2756
04:37:42,800 --> 04:37:51,800
Let me go back here and see.

2757
04:37:51,800 --> 04:37:52,800
That's not the list.

2758
04:37:52,800 --> 04:38:05,800
There is a list of maybe insights and commits, that's it.

2759
04:38:05,800 --> 04:38:07,800
So it just shows the number.

2760
04:38:07,800 --> 04:38:08,800
Let's see the traffic.

2761
04:38:08,800 --> 04:38:16,800
Okay, that's just a number, contributors.

2762
04:38:16,800 --> 04:38:18,800
It's taking some time.

2763
04:38:18,800 --> 04:38:23,760
So one way would be, you know, I have these four commits.

2764
04:38:23,760 --> 04:38:25,040
So I made four commits.

2765
04:38:25,040 --> 04:38:26,640
If I click those commits,

2766
04:38:26,640 --> 04:38:30,040
I could see which files they were referring to.

2767
04:38:32,960 --> 04:38:36,400
Then in that way, you could find, you know,

2768
04:38:36,400 --> 04:38:38,680
if you forgot everything about, you know,

2769
04:38:38,680 --> 04:38:42,360
which recipe it was or file name or all the details,

2770
04:38:42,360 --> 04:38:44,160
you could still find out.

2771
04:38:44,160 --> 04:38:47,400
So if I go to that recipe, that file,

2772
04:38:47,400 --> 04:38:52,400
then I would see that, you know, what I have done.

2773
04:38:55,940 --> 04:38:57,100
So that is one way.

2774
04:38:57,100 --> 04:38:58,940
So this you could do in the terminal

2775
04:38:58,940 --> 04:39:01,860
with the command called git show

2776
04:39:01,860 --> 04:39:03,900
and the commit message, it'll show that.

2777
04:39:08,100 --> 04:39:12,660
Apart from that, let's see a file, maybe a desert.

2778
04:39:12,660 --> 04:39:23,900
this file. And if you go to a specific file, you will find this tab called blame. And in

2779
04:39:23,900 --> 04:39:33,860
that file, it'll tell, it'll detail who contributed what, at what point. So this is not really

2780
04:39:33,860 --> 04:39:42,180
to blame people, it is to show that who did what. So those are different ways that you

2781
04:39:42,180 --> 04:39:45,020
you could find out what you did.

2782
04:39:47,860 --> 04:39:51,380
Also, I think there is this pulse or something.

2783
04:39:51,380 --> 04:39:54,020
Let me check that one inside.

2784
04:39:57,580 --> 04:39:59,160
Yeah, people is one thing.

2785
04:40:01,060 --> 04:40:03,460
Then, where is that?

2786
04:40:07,580 --> 04:40:11,660
For frequency, it gives the number of contributions

2787
04:40:11,660 --> 04:40:18,940
by each person, maybe contributors.

2788
04:40:18,940 --> 04:40:19,860
Yeah.

2789
04:40:19,860 --> 04:40:22,780
So here, I think we showed that earlier, how many lines,

2790
04:40:22,780 --> 04:40:27,540
how many commits that has been contributed.

2791
04:40:27,540 --> 04:40:29,780
Yeah, I think that's all, [name].

2792
04:40:29,780 --> 04:40:32,420
Anything else that we have mentioned?

2793
04:40:32,420 --> 04:40:35,140
For tomorrow, is there anything that?

2794
04:40:35,140 --> 04:40:35,740
Next week.

2795
04:40:35,740 --> 04:40:38,740
For the next week, the next day, day four?

2796
04:40:38,740 --> 04:40:41,860
Yeah, we can start talking a little bit about next week.

2797
04:40:41,860 --> 04:40:45,620
So this week has been the version control week.

2798
04:40:45,620 --> 04:40:50,060
So basically, everything about Git and these very, well,

2799
04:40:50,060 --> 04:40:53,980
artificial but somewhat, yeah, if you

2800
04:40:53,980 --> 04:40:57,460
can share the feedback form, that would be good.

2801
04:40:57,460 --> 04:41:01,300
That would be good.

2802
04:41:01,300 --> 04:41:03,900
But next week, we really change tracks.

2803
04:41:03,900 --> 04:41:09,980
and we begin looking at much more applied things. So if I remember right,

2804
04:41:10,780 --> 04:41:18,780
Tuesday is social coding and reproducible research, where we talk about how to build

2805
04:41:18,780 --> 04:41:24,540
larger projects, how to license your code, encourage feedback, how to share things,

2806
04:41:24,540 --> 04:41:32,380
and so on. Reproducible research is making, well, computational research more reproducible.

2807
04:41:32,380 --> 04:41:43,840
Wednesday is Jupyter and documentation, and then Thursday is automated testing and modular

2808
04:41:43,840 --> 04:41:45,240
code development.

2809
04:41:45,240 --> 04:41:50,920
And basically all of these future lessons somehow use Git in more applied things.

2810
04:41:50,920 --> 04:41:57,120
So if some things you see today seem a bit abstract, if you come next week you can see

2811
04:41:57,120 --> 04:42:01,720
the real use cases as we do things.

2812
04:42:01,720 --> 04:42:05,320
So on the other hand,

2813
04:42:05,320 --> 04:42:08,120
since these are, so we

2814
04:42:08,120 --> 04:42:09,520
used to have a lot of exercises

2815
04:42:09,520 --> 04:42:11,260
for next week and we still do.

2816
04:42:11,260 --> 04:42:14,720
But next week is all focused on demos.

2817
04:42:14,720 --> 04:42:16,600
So during the courses,

2818
04:42:16,600 --> 04:42:19,120
we'll give demos on the topics.

2819
04:42:19,120 --> 04:42:25,240
And then, and yes,

2820
04:42:25,240 --> 04:42:26,420
so we give demos,

2821
04:42:26,420 --> 04:42:31,460
but we leave it up to you to do the exercises yourself after the workshop.

2822
04:42:31,460 --> 04:42:36,020
So it'll feel a little bit different, but we still have plenty for you to do.

2823
04:42:36,820 --> 04:42:44,420
Just with a 20 or 25 or 30 minute exercise break, it's just not feasible to have enough

2824
04:42:44,420 --> 04:42:47,780
time for everyone to do everything. So this is what we've settled on.

2825
04:42:49,860 --> 04:42:54,660
But definitely... So [name], we have the feedback. Could you mention a little bit about

2826
04:42:54,660 --> 04:42:55,160
Yes.

2827
04:42:55,160 --> 04:42:56,260
The feedback box.

2828
04:42:56,260 --> 04:42:56,760
Yes.

2829
04:42:56,760 --> 04:42:59,180
So we have the feedback here.

2830
04:42:59,180 --> 04:43:02,300
I guess you've seen this from past weeks.

2831
04:43:02,300 --> 04:43:05,740
We're writing the news for the next day, which

2832
04:43:05,740 --> 04:43:08,780
will also be emailed out.

2833
04:43:08,780 --> 04:43:14,660
Please do add in all your comments and so on.

2834
04:43:17,700 --> 04:43:18,200
Yeah.

2835
04:43:18,200 --> 04:43:20,220
And also things to improve.

2836
04:43:20,220 --> 04:43:22,340
Please give honest opinion.

2837
04:43:22,340 --> 04:43:24,020
Improve next.

2838
04:43:24,020 --> 04:43:26,260
there are something that we can improve by next week,

2839
04:43:26,260 --> 04:43:27,740
maybe in future courses,

2840
04:43:27,740 --> 04:43:33,340
and we don't take that personally if something can improve.

2841
04:43:33,340 --> 04:43:35,780
So please provide that in a positive way, of course,

2842
04:43:35,780 --> 04:43:43,260
positive feedback on how to improve it as much as you can describe,

2843
04:43:43,260 --> 04:43:45,100
not too much either.

2844
04:43:45,100 --> 04:43:49,060
But if you saw something that we should improve,

2845
04:43:49,060 --> 04:43:50,540
please let us know.

2846
04:43:50,540 --> 04:43:53,100
We don't take it as negative.

2847
04:43:53,100 --> 04:43:57,900
We take it as a positive thing for us to improve next time.

2848
04:43:57,900 --> 04:43:58,620
Yeah.

2849
04:43:58,620 --> 04:44:00,860
So go ahead.

2850
04:44:00,860 --> 04:44:05,100
Yeah, and there was a question about how to interact with us.

2851
04:44:05,100 --> 04:44:07,340
Join the Zulip chat, as mentioned in the chat.

2852
04:44:07,340 --> 04:44:11,620
So we will be there most of the time, most of us.

2853
04:44:11,620 --> 04:44:14,660
But you are welcome to join the community chat.

2854
04:44:14,660 --> 04:44:16,140
That would be great.

2855
04:44:16,140 --> 04:44:17,300
Yeah.

2856
04:44:17,300 --> 04:44:20,140
And also, if you want to re-deliver this,

2857
04:44:20,140 --> 04:44:22,140
please join the Code Refinery team.

2858
04:44:22,140 --> 04:44:31,180
organize local workshops in your workplace if you like the workshops and also [name] you know

2859
04:44:31,180 --> 04:44:35,740
since morning they were seeing us a lot but you know there's a lot of people behind this

2860
04:44:35,740 --> 04:44:41,500
yeah the organizers and the people who coordinate this for example [name] was managing the

2861
04:44:42,700 --> 04:44:48,460
the stream with a lot of balls juggling he has you know in addition to the work he had some

2862
04:44:48,460 --> 04:44:57,020
issues he has to attend to and all the [name] was really helping and without also the team

2863
04:44:57,020 --> 04:45:03,980
leaders who are working with the team that was very good that we have that kind of different

2864
04:45:03,980 --> 04:45:11,260
type of learning teams that everything all all behind the scenes you you saw only us today but

2865
04:45:11,260 --> 04:45:16,220
there were many people behind the scene and just want to thank you thank you for your participation

2866
04:45:16,220 --> 04:45:22,220
and thank you for all who work very hard to make it possible behind the scenes. Thank you.

2867
04:45:23,420 --> 04:45:30,700
So [name], as a final thing, if somebody wants to let's say thank us, what is the best way to do

2868
04:45:30,700 --> 04:45:41,180
that? Tell people about this and then in a few years, if you're still involved in this,

2869
04:45:41,180 --> 04:45:44,780
help mentor the people who take the course in the future.

2870
04:45:46,860 --> 04:45:50,620
And if you're really interested, then come join us later.

2871
04:45:50,620 --> 04:45:55,900
But starting local with mentoring others is, I think, the most important impact.

2872
04:45:56,780 --> 04:45:59,020
Do you know more about this ambassador program?

2873
04:46:00,540 --> 04:46:02,140
Do you have any more information about it?

2874
04:46:05,020 --> 04:46:10,860
There's something called Code Refinery Ambassadors, which we're starting.

2875
04:46:11,180 --> 04:46:17,820
where basically it's people that know a lot about these tools and want to go and support people at

2876
04:46:17,820 --> 04:46:29,100
their own institutions or areas a little bit more in these things. Maybe we can hear more about this

2877
04:46:29,100 --> 04:46:35,180
next week. I think it's on the website. Maybe someone can add it to the notes down there.

2878
04:46:35,180 --> 04:46:59,180
Yeah. I would like to say one thing. So earlier in the day, there was a comment about niceness and political correctness that we removed. So this wasn't a bad thing. Like, there's nothing wrong. But it's something that we didn't have time to go into more depth at the time.

2879
04:46:59,180 --> 04:47:05,820
time. And actually next Tuesday in social coding would be a good time to talk more about these,

2880
04:47:05,820 --> 04:47:12,220
like bringing more people on boards. So in hindsight, us, the people that had been managing

2881
04:47:12,220 --> 04:47:16,540
the notes and answering the questions, I think we would have liked to have left it there but

2882
04:47:16,540 --> 04:47:24,860
pointed out to resume this next week. So us in the background would like to apologize for that.

2883
04:47:24,860 --> 04:47:32,860
But we do, like, in general, like even off-topic cheering and other things like that.

2884
04:47:32,860 --> 04:47:33,860
Okay.

2885
04:47:33,860 --> 04:47:35,860
Anything else?

2886
04:47:35,860 --> 04:47:38,860
I think, yeah, that's it.

2887
04:47:38,860 --> 04:47:41,860
It's in your hand, Rijat, now.

2888
04:47:41,860 --> 04:47:42,860
Yeah.

2889
04:47:42,860 --> 04:47:43,860
Okay.

2890
04:47:43,860 --> 04:47:45,860
You have to take down things.

2891
04:47:45,860 --> 04:47:51,860
So, yeah, I guess we've said enough.

2892
04:47:51,860 --> 04:47:58,660
We hope to see you next week, and we hope you like the change of pace then.

2893
04:47:58,660 --> 04:48:02,380
So maybe we can hang up now.

2894
04:48:02,380 --> 04:48:04,060
Thank you.

2895
04:48:04,060 --> 04:48:05,060
Okay.

2896
04:48:05,060 --> 04:48:06,060
Thank you.

2897
04:48:06,060 --> 04:48:07,060
Bye.

2898
04:48:07,060 --> 04:48:08,180
Thank you very much.

2899
04:48:21,860 --> 04:48:23,920
you
