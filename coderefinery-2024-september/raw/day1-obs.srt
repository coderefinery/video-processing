00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
CodeRefinery.org

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,060
you

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,060
you

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,060
you

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,060
you

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,060
you

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,060
you

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,060
you

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,060
you

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,060
you

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
failed hello um hello

13
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,840
yeah let's see can people hear us online according to

14
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,920
unless you should be able to hear me someone else say something

15
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,680
hello welcome good morning hi good morning

16
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Also, let us know how the audio levels are, whether we are balanced.

17
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Yes.

18
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah, should we do the typical test thing?

19
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,680
So, okay, the order is me, [name], [name].

20
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
One.

21
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
One.

22
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
One.

23
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Two.

24
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Two.

25
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Two.

26
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Three.

27
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Three.

28
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Three.

29
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Okay.

30
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,960
So, that was our audio test.

31
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,680
Are we relatively balanced?

32
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Yes, if there's no complaints at least, then it's not too bad.

33
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,040
So yeah, welcome everyone.

34
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,680
We're excited to be here.

35
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:07,200
We're still getting some stuff set up, but yeah, well, Autumn Code Refinery Workshop.

36
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,280
What's your general thoughts on this, [name] and [name]?

37
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Exciting.

38
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,080
Exciting times, always the one where I think I have a feeling the registrations come like

39
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:29,360
the week before, most of them people starting university again and finding it.

40
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:38,240
Yeah, for me it's become fairly routine and all.

41
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Maybe I'll switch to the notes here.

42
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,360
We can talk about that.

43
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,600
We'll introduce ourselves a bit later.

44
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I can switch it here.

45
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Oh, you've got it.

46
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Okay.

47
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah.

48
00:07:48,600 --> 00:08:00,520
Well, I'm [name], and with me is [name] and [name] here, who are the teachers and

49
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,200
hosts for the day.

50
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,320
So the first order of business is how we can talk and interact with each other.

51
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:20,880
So [name] is here sharing what we call the notes, which is basically the way you can

52
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
interact with us.

53
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,880
So this is only for registered participants, so you can find it in your email.

54
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,040
Is it sent to everyone when they register automatically?

55
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Yes.

56
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Okay.

57
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Yeah.

58
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:39,200
So basically, it's an editable document kind of thing.

59
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
So, [name], can you talk about it a little bit?

60
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes, and we will also show this in about five to ten minutes again when the official course starts.

61
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,200
But basically, if you have made it to this page, which [name] said you can find the link in your email,

62
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,200
you can either up here to the right, or if you have a bit wider window, you can find it up here on the left,

63
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,640
a little pin symbol, and that lets you actually edit this document.

64
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,720
So you can see we have put some information here,

65
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,640
links to the schedule, some information about the

66
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,880
screen setup, how we suggest that you have your screen set up,

67
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,920
and then we have an icebreaker question here.

68
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,360
So maybe we can go there and fill that in. So I have my pin symbol up here.

69
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,800
for you it might be up here on the right together with an eye and a book symbol I believe.

70
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,960
You can test out a little bit what works best for you. This changes to edit mode,

71
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,840
now you can scroll slowly down and we have two icebreaker questions here.

72
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
[name], how is the weather in TromsÃ¸?

73
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Oh, relatively warm.

74
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Yep.

75
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I edited it.

76
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,520
At least, I wasn't outside, but it looks not too cold.

77
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It's cloudy.

78
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,880
It's been weird the last few days, but, like, surprisingly, warm.

79
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,680
I'll also add here.

80
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Cool.

81
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Here, too.

82
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:21,480
I think right now, let me find a window, cloudy, but warm.

83
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,680
just got sunny where I am, so maybe sun's coming your way also. Ah, great. Yeah.

84
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,480
And then we also have a second icebreaker here. Have you used Git before? So Git is topic of,

85
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,080
well, basically all of this week in the workshop, so it will be interesting to see if you have heard

86
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,720
about it, if you don't know what it is, if you've heard about it but not used it yet.

87
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:58,720
So we have this little voting going on, so basically it's you add a little O for your

88
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,920
vote or write below if you have any more comments on this.

89
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,800
So it's like a dynamically generated bar graph or something like that.

90
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Right.

91
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
That's cool.

92
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Yeah.

93
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Okay.

94
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,260
But yeah, these notes are like our home base.

95
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,180
So when we're teaching, we're always watching this, and the questions you answer are going

96
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,720
back into what we're teaching.

97
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,600
We also have a whole bunch of other people that are watching this and answering the questions

98
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,060
that we don't answer by voice.

99
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,180
So we answer... how many questions do we answer during a workshop?

100
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
A lot?

101
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,900
Yeah, like 100, 200.

102
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,060
I think one time when it peaked, it was like a new question every two minutes, and then

103
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,120
We had two people just typing, typing, typing.

104
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,400
The wonderful thing is that we get lots

105
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,400
of interesting questions and we then also interesting answers

106
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,320
and we think there is a lot of value

107
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
in keeping the questions and keeping the answers.

108
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,960
So we attach them later to the workshop

109
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,460
and we don't just delete them.

110
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,380
They are part of the experience.

111
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,720
Yeah.

112
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes, and don't worry if it gets too much,

113
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
you may have noticed already now

114
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,340
during answering the icebreaker,

115
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,220
that there's multiple people talking,

116
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,060
so a lot happening there.

117
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,420
If it ever gets too much, just leave it be,

118
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,700
follow the stream, watch everything,

119
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,620
and come back to it later.

120
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,500
It will not vanish,

121
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,400
and we'll make sure to back it up once in a while as well.

122
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,020
Yeah.

123
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,300
Okay.

124
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
I'll switch back to view mode here,

125
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,780
to have it like everyone's.

126
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,780
And then I'll have this up top.

127
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,780
It's also good, yeah.

128
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,780
Okay.

129
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780
Yeah.

130
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,780
Let's still wait two minutes or so for people to join.

131
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
At least according to my clock.

132
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Almost ten o'clock finish time.

133
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
Yeah.

134
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,780
What are you most excited about right now?

135
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,300
I mean, I have a feeling there's so much I don't know what to think about.

136
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Yes.

137
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,500
I mean, in some ways it's anticlimactic, because all this work, and now if everything

138
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,780
goes well, it's boring and uneventful, because we planned it all, but who knows what could

139
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,780
happen.

140
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
I think it will be eventful.

141
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
Yeah.

142
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,900
So, I'm excited about getting people excited about version control, that's one thing.

143
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:51,500
I think really giving understanding of what it is and removing some of the barriers.

144
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,500
And I think there will still be, for me, there is still a lot of improvisation elements today.

145
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,260
I don't really know exactly what we will do, but in a good way.

146
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,780
I think we will try to make it really interesting.

147
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,940
So for me, it's very exciting because we kind of do certain things a little bit on the fly,

148
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
but by design.

149
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,860
And we have a few new people involved this time also for teaching, that's I think also

150
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,860
very exciting because everyone teaches, even though it's the same material, everyone teaches

151
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,820
it a little bit differently and I think that's also always very exciting to see how different

152
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,580
people approach it. [name], can you scroll the notes down to show the things people are saying?

153
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
Yeah.

154
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,180
Yeah, I think we also can slowly start now.

155
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Okay.

156
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,980
Or how's your clock?

157
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,620
Yeah, my clock says it's time to go.

158
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,180
So how do we follow the notes when you're starting things?

159
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,660
Sorry?

160
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,620
How do you follow the notes when you're starting?

161
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,660
So if someone's watching, you start, and we start a new section, what should they look

162
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:09,420
Oh, sorry. Okay. So, maybe first of all, welcome everyone to the Code Refinery workshop.

163
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,500
This is September 2024. We're very excited to be here, and I will answer [name]'s question

164
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,060
in a moment. So not everyone has joined us already the last ten minutes,

165
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,140
so maybe you don't even know what we're talking about.

166
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:32,060
Hi everyone, my name is [name]. I work at CSC in Finland and I will be guiding you through the

167
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,660
first 20 minutes of today's workshop. After that I will give the word to [name] and [name] who

168
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:45,660
will guide you through the rest of today's day, today's workshop. I'll be showing you around

169
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,460
a little bit how things are working in this workshop, so you may have noticed that things

170
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,300
are already maybe a little bit differently than you are used to, that you are watching on stream

171
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:03,260
and we are here somewhere else, but you can still see us and you can still also interact with us.

172
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:12,060
And for that you have gotten a link in your email either yesterday or when you registered to this

173
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:19,100
workshop which starts with nodes.coderefinery.org. This is our way on how you can interact with the

174
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,220
instructors and this is what I'm showing here on screen right now. So here you can find a few

175
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:34,140
links in the top for example to our code of conduct and if you encounter any issues,

176
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:41,340
anyone's not being nice, anything that you want to report, then you can follow this link

177
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:49,740
to get to a form that you can fill out to complain about it. Then everyone who is registered has

178
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,820
gotten this link, if you're not registered you can still do so and then in the registration

179
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,980
confirmation you will get this link to the notes. You can find the schedule here and from the

180
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:09,580
schedule, I can open it briefly, so this is the course page, you can also find the link to all the

181
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,380
materials. So we are right now welcoming introduction and then the introduction to

182
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,860
version control you can find behind these links. We'll also try to add that to the notes here.

183
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:29,900
We have here one suggestion for the screen setup. So as you may have noticed we are sharing in this

184
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,940
more portrait mode and that is so that you can have other stuff right next to it. And I think

185
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,940
Was it so that Twitch has this, what was it called, pop-out window or what was it?

186
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,940
There's theater mode and there's also maybe a pop-out window, yeah.

187
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Yeah, so you can have the web browser with the stream on one side of your screen,

188
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,940
and then if you want to follow, for example, in the terminal, or if you want to follow in VS Code, or we will talk about that later,

189
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,620
whatever you else need and for example also this note you can have on the side.

190
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,780
And this document we will share once in a while on stream so please don't put any names or other

191
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,700
identifying information on this but other than that since you are not here with us in the Zoom

192
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,140
room but we are streamed to you there is no danger of you appearing on the stream.

193
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,980
We have put some icebreaker questions here,

194
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,780
so that we all get used to using the collaborative documents

195
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,220
and also to get to know how the weather is

196
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,100
wherever you are connecting from.

197
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,540
And let's briefly go through how you can do that.

198
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,420
So, my window is very narrow.

199
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,460
So, if I scroll up a little bit,

200
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,060
I will find a little pen symbol up here to the right.

201
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,780
And maybe I can even zoom.

202
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,140
Well, it doesn't really make it bigger.

203
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,180
a little pen symbol upright for you.

204
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,420
It might be somewhere here next to this HedgeDoc logo.

205
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,840
There is probably a eye, a book and a pen symbol.

206
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,640
It's always a pen symbol that you are looking for.

207
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,560
And if we click that, we go into edit mode

208
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,680
and then we can already see

209
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,740
someone is writing here right now.

210
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,340
So this is how we can all now go here

211
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,720
to the icebreaker question

212
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,720
and tell us how the weather is where you are.

213
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,820
And if you want some of the emojis also work here,

214
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,820
for example, we can add a sun with face

215
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,740
to my Espoo cloudy but warm thing.

216
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,620
So yeah, please let us know how is the weather

217
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,540
where you are, or we have already a lot of people here

218
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,960
joining from many different places.

219
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,100
That is really nice.

220
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,000
And then our second icebreaker question is,

221
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,980
have you used Git before?

222
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,380
So Git is what we will be talking about a lot this week.

223
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,560
It's not bad if you haven't heard about it at all,

224
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,400
please add a little O here in the end

225
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,160
if you don't know what Git is.

226
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,180
If you have used it before, you can add it to the yes,

227
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,940
or if you have heard but not used it before to the no.

228
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,080
So it's kind of a little voting system bar graph.

229
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:35,080
And if you want, you can also add some more comments below here, like you've seen some people have already done.

230
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:44,080
And then later, we will always add little sections here. And this is now the answer to [name]'s question. Sorry, it took a while.

231
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:53,080
So, whenever we go to the next section, we will add another header here, like this.

232
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,080
And then also the link to the materials.

233
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,080
And then later today we will also have exercise sessions,

234
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,080
where we will then tell you how long the exercise sessions are

235
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,080
and what you are supposed to be doing in those exercise sessions.

236
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,080
And just for you to know, there's many different ways on how someone can join this workshop.

237
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,080
So some of you might be watching it alone on stream and then do the exercises by yourself.

238
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,880
and then there's other people who met either in the same room locally or in

239
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,800
the same Zoom room to do the exercises together. And so we might sometimes say

240
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,280
like breakout rooms or local rooms or these kind of things just so you know

241
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:42,280
what we are talking about. So let's go briefly also to the introduction

242
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,360
materials here that we have collected. You can read through them also by

243
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,840
by yourself, we'll now go through them rather fast

244
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,680
in the next 10 minutes,

245
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,320
but we have also already done some of these things.

246
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,240
So why are we here?

247
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,480
So Code Refinery is basically building on top

248
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,660
of more the general coding classes.

249
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,080
So we don't focus here on programming

250
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,980
or writing code so much,

251
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,640
but we are trying to support you to make your code

252
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,200
that you are already writing more reproducible.

253
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:37,360
And we have this really nice graphics here by [name] that we are always using to also explain a little bit what the course is about, because all of our lessons that will come up in the next six half days, this and next week, somehow fit in these six helpful steps for reproducible research.

254
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,440
So, we'll take a look at how you get your files and folders in order, why also good

255
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,920
naming for files, folders, and functions is quite important, how to document your codes

256
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,280
and maybe also your data, what are essential parts of a README file that you can add to

257
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:10,960
your code, what kind of metadata is needed, what are code comments and how you can use them,

258
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,200
and how you can write useful comments in your own code. Then what we'll start with today,

259
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:28,400
version control, what it is, why it matters, what it enables also, and then

260
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,080
Then mainly next week it's also a lot about stabilizing the computing environment and

261
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,720
the software you are using.

262
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,160
You may have heard about dependency management, containers and that kind of stuff.

263
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,660
So we'll briefly look into that as well.

264
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:50,360
And then also what goes into publishing your research outputs, like publishing your code

265
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:57,880
in specifically here, licensing, what kind of licenses are there, why would you want to

266
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:05,400
add one, and so on. So this really covers all the topics of these workshops.

267
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,360
And we are here from Code Refinery, so Code Refinery is the name of the workshop. It's also

268
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,240
the name of the project that runs these workshops and many others. We are Nordic Projects

269
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:27,400
and we teach this, let's say, more basic scientific computing tools and we are funded by the Nordic

270
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:34,040
Infrastructure Collaboration. And basically what we are, we are a community of research software

271
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:40,600
enthusiasts from all over the Nordics and beyond. And you can find our website here,

272
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,320
coderefinery.org, where you can find all kinds of things from the previous workshops,

273
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:53,600
workshops, all kinds of materials also from other workshops and the partners and whatever

274
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,760
else. You can also find how you can join us, so if this workshop is something that you

275
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,560
enjoy, and you would like to go further with this, you would like to maybe be part of the

276
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:12,520
Code Refinery project, there is a whole page on how you can do that.

277
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,800
So we already talked a little bit about how these workshops work.

278
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,660
So we will have the live stream here.

279
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:30,160
We will have the collaborative notes for communication between you among yourselves and also towards

280
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,560
the instructors and also the instructors with you.

281
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,000
Sometimes we might add some questions to you in the collaborative notes also.

282
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,600
I'll show them in the end.

283
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:49,360
more. And then in week one, we will have the teaching happening here on stream by [name]

284
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,720
and [name] today. And then we will have exercises. And these you can, like I mentioned, either do by

285
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,080
yourself or in your team. Depends on how you're joining this. In week two, there is no dedicated

286
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:12,240
team exercise times anymore. So if you have joined a workshop some time ago already, that is

287
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,320
something that we have changed. There will be a lot of interaction via the collaborative document

288
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,240
and if you are meeting with your team, we highly recommend to just meet after the workshop and

289
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,840
talk through the exercises. And if you don't have a team, you can also join our Bring Your Own Code

290
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,160
sessions after the workshop and ask us questions about these exercises if you want to do them on

291
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:47,360
your own time. Then we plan on having a minimum of 10 minute break every hour and one hour break

292
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,880
at approximately lunchtime and the materials will stay available and are always linked from

293
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,640
this workshop page. The workshop page will also be available so you will always have everything

294
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,320
together. We will make the recordings available. You can watch them on Twitch still for a while

295
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,440
and then we also put them on YouTube. The collaborative document, we already talked about this.

296
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,360
I can show it again here. So it looks like this when you click on the link that was in

297
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,400
the registration confirmation email and then you can find this little pen symbol

298
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,600
to change into edit mode and answer our icebreakers here. First what's the weather

299
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,960
where you're connecting from and second one have you used git before and if you want you can also

300
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:52,000
add some comments and we already have someone writing here that you can also download the

301
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,160
videos from YouTube later. So no worries if you have to leave during the workshop or if you cannot

302
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:06,560
join for the whole day, you will be able to to catch up again. Sorry, I should find the right tab again.

303
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:17,520
While you are watching, it might be beneficial to keep the notes in the view mode, so that you can

304
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,520
do by clicking this eye symbol. Again it might be here up to the right or if you have a bit wider

305
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,200
window it might be up here on the left. Then you can still follow what's happening here like if

306
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,000
someone writes you still see it. But if we have a lot of people editing the document

307
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
it might be a bit more performant if most of us are in view mode.

308
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:51,920
And then there will be exercises this week as mentioned and for that so that you have a bit

309
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:59,200
easier life after the workshop we suggest to create your own course directory or course folder on your

310
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:08,080
computer that you are working on. This way you have it all in one place and you can then remove

311
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,880
it after the workshop without having to find all the different different directories again later.

312
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,720
We already talked about the screen arrangement so that you can find a way that works for you.

313
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,080
This is just our suggestion to have the theater mode for Twitch and then have the right side of

314
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,560
your screen for the collaborative nodes and your terminal or other tools that you need to open.

315
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:53,080
We suggest that your first priority always is to follow the live stream so that you can follow what is going on, what we're doing at every moment, and that's where the teaching is happening.

316
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,080
We know that this is a lot of different things to follow.

317
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:07,080
We have the live stream, we have the collaborative notes, we have the lesson materials, and then if you're doing exercises you probably have yet another window.

318
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:20,080
So live stream, I feel is the most important one, then the collaborative notes, and then the lesson materials webpage, we will be often sharing them on stream so you don't really need to have them open by yourself.

319
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,080
During teaching session at least.

320
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,880
So you can also have that close and really focus on the live stream.

321
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,880
And for the collaborative notes, if you have a question,

322
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,080
you add it to the bottom of the document and then someone will answer.

323
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,480
It might sometimes take a moment for answers to get in there.

324
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,880
So you also don't have to follow it at all times.

325
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,580
You can also then go back in the break or during exercise session

326
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,820
or after the workshop to check it.

327
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,420
So, we have shared the notes document.

328
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,300
This is also the document where you please let us know as early as possible

329
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,140
if there is any major accessibility problem.

330
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Meaning either you can't hear us, something is not visible,

331
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,380
it seems like we want to share something, but you don't see that.

332
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,500
If we forget to have a break,

333
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:30,500
If there is an explanation that is unintelligible, please let us know right away so that we can fix it, so that we can make this a really nice experience for everyone.

334
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,500
No one has to suffer through bad audio, for example.

335
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:45,500
And also, since we have always multiple teachers, let us know if the volumes are balanced, so that not one is very loud and one is very low.

336
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:52,220
very low. We try to do that always in the beginning, but things may change. So please let us know.

337
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,620
There might be mistakes happening on the on the stream and we think that's a great

338
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:05,020
possibility for learning, so you can also see how our instructors fix their mistakes.

339
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,940
And if there is something due to that that you then didn't understand, for example,

340
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Then you can use this bring your own code sessions after the workshop to ask more questions about it, to ask more clarifications. We very welcome everyone to join those sessions. You will also get another invite for those later.

341
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:34,140
slide photos later. We covered that if the collaborative document is going too fast,

342
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:42,420
then just don't bother basically following it. You can always come back to it later.

343
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:49,140
If you have any trouble, any technical issues, you can of course ask in the collaborative

344
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,740
notes, but it might be that we cannot solve them for you. It might be that you really

345
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,940
you need to have support from your local IT support.

346
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,340
So then we suggest to basically lean back,

347
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,100
watch what's happening here,

348
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,100
figure things out with your local IT support later,

349
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,020
and then do the exercises after that.

350
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,620
We try to stay on schedule,

351
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,460
but sometimes things don't go as planned.

352
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,800
Things happen, cats visit, whatever.

353
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,260
And so it might be a little bit before or after time,

354
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,340
but in general, we try to stay on schedule

355
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,820
that we have published on our event page.

356
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,420
So you can follow along there.

357
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,320
It might be that the collaborative notes

358
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,100
are getting a little bit slow

359
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,420
or things are going in wrong places or something.

360
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Usually that resolves itself after a moment,

361
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,060
often going into view mode

362
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,780
and then going back into edit mode helps with that.

363
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,620
But please also, well, yeah, it's hard to let us know

364
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,220
if it happens, but if it happens many, many times,

365
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,460
and in between you can write,

366
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,960
then use that in between to let us know about it.

367
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:12,060
We have some emergency backup things in place for that.

368
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,500
If the stream suddenly dies,

369
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,580
then probably [name]'s computer has given up

370
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,940
or electricity has gone down

371
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,940
or the cat unplugged the cable, or something like that.

372
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,860
Just stay around, and we will resume in about five minutes,

373
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,940
which is pretty fast to get things back up.

374
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,060
But we try our best.

375
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,260
So it might happen.

376
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,860
Don't panic.

377
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,620
And then for the exercises, we have sent out

378
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,260
installation instructions on installing and configuring

379
00:34:50,260 --> 00:35:04,260
If you haven't done that, but still would like to follow the exercises, you can try that during the exercise sessions, or you just watch the stream and read through the things and do the exercises later.

380
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,260
I mentioned already that it's okay to not attend every day.

381
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:16,260
Everything will be available. There might be cats visiting instructors, just enjoy the show.

382
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:22,020
And if you want to know more about this course because you really like it, we will have a

383
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:28,100
workshop outro at the end of day six, where we'll give some hints on where you can go next.

384
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,460
And then just so you know, we have over 300 registered participants for this course, so also

385
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:42,180
the notes. There might really be happening quite a lot, and these are from over 20 different

386
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:49,380
countries and we have about 10 course coordinators, instructors and facilitators for this workshop

387
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,100
that are working hard in the background behind also the instructors to support you with your

388
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:02,740
learning by answering questions and keeping everything on track. And that also means we

389
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:12,740
We have people from all levels, from very programming beginners to advanced programmers

390
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
and then also many different backgrounds.

391
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,060
So please be respectful and helpful.

392
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,140
Anyone can answer any questions in the collaborative notes if you know the answer.

393
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,900
And sometimes it's actually good to have a few different opinions, a few different answers

394
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,020
in there as well.

395
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,340
We like to keep track of who is here.

396
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,380
So if you are watching the stream and you don't have access to the notes, for example,

397
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,680
and you haven't gotten any emails from us, then you probably haven't registered.

398
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,800
We would like you to do that so that we can keep track on who's here.

399
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,240
This will help us with future funding and so on.

400
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,960
And you will get access to the notes, which is also quite nice.

401
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,280
If you want certificates, we will mention this also in the outro, how you can get that

402
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,160
there is also a link on the workshop page for that.

403
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,680
We as a community

404
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,120
we hang out in our Zulip chat and you can find that link to that

405
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:25,320
on our website or also behind this link here. We have a lot of manuals

406
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,920
available if you want to run your own code refinery workshop or want to

407
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,000
get more involved or get to know what we're actually doing behind the scenes.

408
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:41,000
And we are on all like social media platforms on Mustard and Twitter and LinkedIn and if you like

409
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,600
this workshop or also not, share with your colleagues that you are here and what you

410
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:54,840
are learning. We are always happy to read the different views also. And now I'm already a

411
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,960
a little bit over time. I'm very sorry for that. I'll give over to [name] and [name] to start with

412
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,840
the introduction to version control and I'll add this also in the notes.

413
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,880
Thank you and have fun. Thanks for the intro. See you.

414
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:27,640
Yeah, thanks so much for this very nice intro. And hello, everybody. I'm not the one. Hello

415
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,440
from Northern Norway. Oh, it's isn't it cool that we have people joining from so many different

416
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,200
places. Some of these places make me really jealous to be to be at. So I'm not about working

417
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:49,160
the university in terms of doing teaching and support in research software engineering,

418
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:56,200
computing, programming. And I will be teaching today and tomorrow, and with me today is [name]

419
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:05,720
from Alpo. Yeah, I'm also basically a research software engineer and have been around here

420
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:16,200
quite a while so how do we start with um yeah motivation or yeah today we'll talk about

421
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,240
git maybe before going into motivation i want to give people a little bit of overview of what to

422
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,960
expect so we'll maybe dial back here so here you can always find where we are and the link that

423
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,960
that I will open right now is this one, and it's up here.

424
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,080
I want to give you an overview of what to expect today,

425
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,200
what to expect tomorrow, when to expect breaks,

426
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,520
we will do breaks, when to expect exercises.

427
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,280
So I know the font is a little bit small,

428
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,920
I will zoom in to make that more visible.

429
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,360
So plan for today is that we want to talk

430
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,840
about version control in Git.

431
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,600
We will clarify what is the difference

432
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,440
between git and github, it's not a problem at all if you are new to these tools.

433
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,480
And we saw from the notes that many people are new to it.

434
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,960
So what I understand, we have a way for both new and more advanced people to get something

435
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,400
from this week.

436
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,120
Exactly.

437
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,320
So we will try to keep everybody really interested.

438
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,580
there will be, so if you are new to Git, GitHub,

439
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,340
no problem at all, you can start from zero.

440
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,540
If you are already familiar with Git and GitHub,

441
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,340
there will be also interesting new things to learn

442
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,100
both today and tomorrow, so please, everybody stay with us.

443
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,180
Those who are very experienced, they can, for instance,

444
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,280
help us answering questions in the notes.

445
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,060
So that's one, or help your neighbor

446
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,260
if you work in a team, help your teammate,

447
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,560
so many different ways to participate.

448
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,620
We have on kind of, we will do this in an interesting way.

449
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,100
We will actually not start from an empty project.

450
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,060
We used to do that in the past.

451
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,780
We will start today on GitHub.

452
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,860
So we will start with something that already exists.

453
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,460
We will start with an existing repository on the web

454
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:27,820
because we felt it will be it will be more instructive for everybody to see how does

455
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:39,820
how does how does it really look in practice today we after short motivation we will then

456
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:47,100
everybody will copy this repository and the first exercise which will start in circa 15

457
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:53,820
minutes. 10-15 minutes will be that we will copy this example repository and browse it

458
00:41:53,820 --> 00:42:03,800
and answer a few questions about it. We will then take a break. After the break, we will

459
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:13,220
learn how to make changes to this repository. And then we will take a longer break. And

460
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,080
then we will practice some more. So we will also learn about what are these things called

461
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:24,720
branches? How can we merge developments? And then tomorrow, we will, there are a couple

462
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,640
of episodes that we will do tomorrow. So tomorrow, we will learn how to clone, inspect history,

463
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,000
and how to turn your own project into a Git repository that you can share and publish

464
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
on GitHub.

465
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,720
Yeah, so the big picture is today, it's like we're contributing to an existing project

466
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,040
someone has already set up, and tomorrow we start to see how to do this from scratch with

467
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
your own stuff.

468
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Yes.

469
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Okay.

470
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
Good.

471
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:59,280
And on this page, you will find that there is a lot more stuff, and we will not show

472
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,760
everything that is here on the page.

473
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:10,400
We chose to show you the most important episodes, but then if you are curious about browsing

474
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,000
some of the other episodes, you can do that. And I mentioned that, so today we will have

475
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:27,360
three exercise session that will be 20 minutes long. One will be in the first hour, the second

476
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,300
will be in the second hour, and then the third one will be after the longer break. If you

477
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,160
are participating as a team, you can then work together and help each other within the

478
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,240
team. If you are participating on your own, you can also go through the exercises and

479
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,920
all of these will will have solutions. And I also wanted to mention now before we go

480
00:43:48,920 --> 00:44:00,200
in how to participate. So the best way to participate is have the notes open to ask

481
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,320
questions or to read questions of other people.

482
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,760
Then on the other half of your screen, you can have this stream.

483
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,240
You can watch [name] and me instructing.

484
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:27,000
And then we will do some practicing which will be in the browser or using Visual Studio Code

485
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,080
or using terminal.

486
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,920
So we offer participants to choose then different ways

487
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,520
to participate, to learn Git,

488
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
but more about that in a moment.

489
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,720
And if that becomes too much, too many windows,

490
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,920
you can then, you can also unwatch the notes

491
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,360
and just focus on the stream.

492
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,520
And if also, if you need to go to a meeting

493
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,800
or somewhere else, you can later also re-watch a recording.

494
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,400
We will later today publish recordings from these sessions.

495
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:08,800
Let's talk about motivation. So why do we, I will go into this motivation section here.

496
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,680
Why do we spend two, three days on Git and version control? Because it's maybe the most

497
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:26,480
important kind of concept in reproducible research coding. Isn't it so?

498
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,760
I guess it's the... well, certainly it's the thing that's transformed my work from a bunch

499
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,120
of random things to something that can seem like work.

500
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,720
But also, when I work with people, the transition to starting to use version control marks the

501
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,200
start of a professionalism that's like, okay, I'm actually making a thing and other people

502
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,880
People actually can use it, they can understand it, they can solve problems better.

503
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,120
So it really is like the first step to, well, stuff.

504
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,960
And what it is, so we've been mentioning version control, it's controlling versions, keeping

505
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,160
track of versions.

506
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,040
And then we mentioned this thing called Git, which is a tool that implements this.

507
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,640
It's not the only tool, but it's the tool that we demonstrate here.

508
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,280
So to be clear, git is the name of a tool?

509
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Yes.

510
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Okay.

511
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,720
And that's the one we teach.

512
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,400
It is the most popular one.

513
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,200
We think it's good for everybody to have seen it.

514
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,320
And keeping track of versions, here I have two examples from a project, which if you

515
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,680
like, you can browse it online.

516
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,600
It's an older project of mine.

517
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,520
And as I was developing, I was like saving versions as I go.

518
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,160
I like to think of Git and version control

519
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,160
like keeping a logbook, like a lab notebook.

520
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,320
So as I go, I was saving versions.

521
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,920
And on this page, we show two different views of it.

522
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,200
The one on top is I took a screenshot from a browser.

523
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,640
So this is the view on GitHub.

524
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,640
GitHub is a place, it's like a web platform

525
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,880
to browse and contribute to Git repositories.

526
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,580
So on top, it's a screenshot from a web.

527
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,960
On the bottom, it's a screenshot

528
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,900
from when I was on the terminal window.

529
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,100
And it's two different views to the same thing.

530
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,520
And what you see here are changes.

531
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,820
So as I was developing, I was saving changes.

532
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,940
And Git and version control

533
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,820
is not only about keeping changes.

534
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,340
It's also about keeping metadata about the changes.

535
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,580
So what you see here is actually

536
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,820
the metadata of the changes.

537
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,660
Who did it?

538
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,900
The author?

539
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,420
When did it happen?

540
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,300
And why was I making these changes?

541
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,260
So I kept these short summaries of changes.

542
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,260
And this is what we will be doing.

543
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,040
And so what we see here,

544
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,740
later we will call them commits.

545
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,820
These are git commits.

546
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,300
A commit is like a snapshot.

547
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,980
A change and a metadata.

548
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,820
And it's really cool that we get questions here.

549
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:28,660
So please keep these questions coming or [name] will help me that we don't miss any questions

550
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,500
that we should discuss in voice.

551
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,180
And on my different screen, I'm also watching watching your questions.

552
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,580
This first question, are we going to talk about that soon?

553
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,620
Or the Git versus GitHub?

554
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,180
Because this always comes up as one of the first questions.

555
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,740
Yeah, let's clarify it now.

556
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:55,340
So Git is this program that keeps track of versions, and GitHub is a web portal platform

557
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:01,780
where we can share, visualize, browse, contribute to Git repositories.

558
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,540
And it's not the only one, another very popular one is called GitLab.

559
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,460
Many universities may have their own GitLabs running.

560
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:16,780
For example, Aalto University has a GitLab because it has an open source version, GitLab

561
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:21,820
does, so people can host it themselves.

562
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:31,860
And we really, today, we want everybody to start using it.

563
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:40,000
And the reason is because it provides an answer to this, to a couple of questions that maybe

564
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,200
Maybe you have heard or asked.

565
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,120
So the some of them I definitely recognize from my work.

566
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,200
So for instance, it broke.

567
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,560
So you develop something, and suddenly it doesn't work anymore.

568
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,720
Hopefully you have a working version somewhere.

569
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,560
Who here has heard this question?

570
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,760
Can you please send me the latest version?

571
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,120
And where is even the latest version?

572
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,840
And when you collaborate with others on,

573
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
it can be code or it can be a manuscript,

574
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,560
we want to avoid confusion of which version

575
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,120
are people using or which version have the authors used

576
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,440
in the paper that I'm trying to reproduce here.

577
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,320
There will be a moment when you find a bug in your code

578
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,680
and then you want to know since when was it there?

579
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,000
Was it there before the publication?

580
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,440
Was it there or did it appear after the publication?

581
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,360
And we need a way to answer these questions.

582
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,200
And what if your laptop is suddenly gone?

583
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,720
Or the hard drive failed?

584
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,640
Is the thesis now gone?

585
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,520
So these questions are maybe familiar,

586
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,680
and version control provides an answer.

587
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,360
Because one thing we can do is we can, if I mess up,

588
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,600
I can go back to a version that used to work.

589
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:09,680
Yeah, like, even just for me, before I was using Git all the time, there was this constant

590
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,360
problem.

591
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:18,840
I would make some changes, and then I'd say, oh, I just broke my scientific code, now I'm

592
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,680
getting some different results.

593
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,400
And I would spend hours or days trying to figure out what I changed.

594
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,360
And it's just the worst feeling ever, like, why would I spend that much time?

595
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,160
And the funny thing, this is even when I was using Git, but I wasn't recording often enough.

596
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,760
So there were too many changes and I lost it.

597
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:44,720
So even just things like this will save you, well, I think it will save you far more time

598
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,200
than you'd spend in it, even without all the other things.

599
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,920
And even if you use it really badly and only with what you learn today and tomorrow, is

600
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,720
than the case, yeah.

601
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,640
Good, and before, there are two more things

602
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,080
that I want to show before we go to our example repository,

603
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,920
because it's not just about keeping versions

604
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,840
and being able to go back.

605
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,840
There are two really important possibilities,

606
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,160
and one is that we can do branching,

607
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,120
and we try to visualize it here with these cute gophers

608
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:33,240
that you can branch out and for instance if you collaborate with multiple people one person

609
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,880
can work on the graduation hat and another person can work on adding sunglasses to the

610
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,320
gopher and we don't have to wait for each other yeah i don't have to wait until you

611
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,800
send me the version via email we can work at the same time and later we can merge our

612
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,360
developments into the main branch.

613
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,920
So it can also be just me on my own if I'd want to try different things and I'm not very

614
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,320
sure whether this is a good idea I can create branches and later merge them really easily.

615
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,640
So this solves the problem of let's say you're working on a manuscript and you send it out

616
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:15,080
to your collaborators and they all send back their revised copies and now you have to sit

617
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,600
there and read all of them and combine them, which is a big waste of time. So I guess here,

618
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:30,120
branching is easy for anything. Merging is hard and what Git does well, if it's in a compatible

619
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:36,600
format, is that? So what the Git does well is that it's really good at figuring out that

620
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,600
even if multiple people edit the same file, if we edit it in different places,

621
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,340
Because it can figure this out and combine these changes most of the time automatically.

622
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,700
And we will later show also what happens if two people modify the same portion of the

623
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,260
file and how to deal with it.

624
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,540
We will come back to that too later today.

625
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,800
Yeah, one more thing I would like to show and then we will go to our example repository

626
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,140
and that is that it's so important for reproducibility.

627
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:15,180
And one feature that you will also then you can try out in the exercise is this annotation

628
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,860
feature.

629
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,760
And I will show you a real example here, I will open it up.

630
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,620
And this is this is some Python code written by other people.

631
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:31,980
We don't need to focus now on the on what it what it really does.

632
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,860
The the interesting feature I wanted to show you is this, this thing that on GitHub, it's

633
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,860
called blame.

634
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,940
It's not a good name.

635
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:44,580
I wish it was called annotate, but I will.

636
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,580
Oh, here we have it.

637
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,940
We have it on.

638
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,840
So I can switch between code and blame.

639
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,520
But this annotation feature that I wanted to show

640
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,060
is that since we kept track of versions

641
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,940
for each line of the code.

642
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,300
So on the right side, there is some Python codes

643
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,660
for each line of this Python codes.

644
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,180
On the left side, I can see which commit.

645
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,740
So which change modified this line last?

646
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,020
And that is incredibly powerful,

647
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:18,060
because let's say that you find out

648
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,100
that maybe you have a question about this line,

649
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,000
or you figure out that in this line of the code,

650
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,400
there is a problem suddenly,

651
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,300
and I really need to know when was this problem introduced?

652
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,840
I can find out four years ago.

653
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,500
And I can, here I could browse the precise commit,

654
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,260
precise change and this is so important for producibility because then my next question

655
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:50,380
is is this before I published it after I published it do I need to inform my collaborators and

656
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:59,660
we need a mechanism to be able to do this and with git we can

657
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:06,820
should we go into our example repository sure yeah I'll put paste it in here yeah

658
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,180
So I'll zoom out here just that you know where to find it.

659
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:15,860
So I will now navigate from the motivation to this modify an existing project, copy

660
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,740
and browse an existing project.

661
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,860
I will go in here.

662
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:29,660
And we will here explain, we will explain what you need to do very briefly and we will

663
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:35,260
then send you to a 20 minute exercise block.

664
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:43,780
And after the exercise block, we will take a break.

665
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:50,580
And this example repository that we have is a collection of cooking recipes.

666
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,180
So you don't it will not be about Python, it will not be about R or MATLAB or C, it

667
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:59,820
will be about cooking recipes, we think cooking recipes are relatable.

668
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:04,500
And we offer you to participate you in different many different ways.

669
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:10,640
You can participate directly on GitHub, just in the web browser.

670
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:17,940
If you prefer to work in your editor, we recommend Visual Studio Code, because it interfaces

671
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,220
very nicely with GitHub.

672
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,740
But for those of you who want to participate in the command line, later below, you can

673
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,300
find different tracks, and then you can select between your favorite track.

674
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,580
It can be the GitHub track, or the VS Code track, or the command line track, or even

675
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,900
i think there is some we have also some options about our studio

676
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:47,820
and the first thing we will do in the exercise is to create a copy and on

677
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,420
on github and on gitlab that is called a fork so we will fork the repository

678
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,220
and create your own copy because then you can modify the copy

679
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:05,900
copy and when creating this copy and we should also show that I don't maybe I should do it

680
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:14,900
or you [name] yeah I can do the typing yep so your first step in the exercise block will

681
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:20,640
be to create this fork and then you can choose do you want to fork this one or do you want

682
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:27,040
to fork this here both are the same so we have two different ones once we want to record

683
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,400
recipe book recorded because this is the one that we will show you on stream.

684
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,280
If you want to make sure that none of the work you do shows up anywhere, then create

685
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,480
a copy of this one.

686
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:47,000
The thing that we will see here in the recorded one, we will see, we will see all the copies

687
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,120
we owe, which copies exist, we will not browse them, don't worry, but we will see them.

688
00:58:52,120 --> 00:59:00,360
I don't know if you want to take screen from me and then create the fork, or should I show

689
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,640
it here on?

690
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,640
I can do it.

691
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,000
So I'm answering questions and putting the stuff there.

692
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,600
Okay, so I will switch to my screen and you can walk me through it.

693
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah.

694
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Is that good?

695
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Okay.

696
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Yes.

697
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
And this will be part of the exercise.

698
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,960
But we just wanted to really show how that works.

699
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
So now it's just demo.

700
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,240
Now it's just demo, I'm just waiting until I see...

701
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:34,240
Here I am on GitHub, and I guess you can't track me, what I'm doing very quickly, or

702
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
can you?

703
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:43,840
Not very quickly, but go back to the material and click on the recipe book recorded one.

704
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:51,760
So we go to browsing, this is the material, and we will open recipe book recorded.

705
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,760
Yes.

706
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Okay.

707
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
Recipe book recorded.

708
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,280
I open it in a new tab.

709
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Yeah.

710
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Here I am.

711
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Okay.

712
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,280
Good.

713
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,120
And there are commits and so on, but it's part of the exercise, so people will explore

714
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,120
it.

715
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,240
But what we want to now show everybody is how to create this copy.

716
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,640
And this is the fork button on top right.

717
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:24,640
OK, so I click it, OK, I make a fork, it will be owned by me and the same name.

718
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,640
I guess we can leave all of the stuff the same.

719
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,640
Yes.

720
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,640
And I click create fork.

721
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:41,640
OK, so to clarify, this is now making a copy of this repository, but it's under my user.

722
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,640
Yeah.

723
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,640
Because here you can make changes.

724
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Okay.

725
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:51,440
So I make, yeah, I make the changes here and I guess we'll eventually learn how to send

726
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,640
changes back or whatever.

727
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,640
Okay.

728
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,640
Exactly.

729
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,640
Yeah.

730
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,440
What do I do now?

731
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,640
And now you can go back to the lesson material and scroll down to the exercise box.

732
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,640
Exercise.

733
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,640
Yes.

734
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
Here we are.

735
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,160
And should I do some of these?

736
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:24,200
No, we will give people time to do these that we have hints, and we have also walkthroughs.

737
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,800
I just wanted to give you the big picture.

738
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:33,600
So the big picture, what your goal will be in 20 minutes is to create this fork.

739
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:38,640
And you will need to have a github account and you need to be logged in on github.

740
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
Yeah.

741
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,640
And then we asked you a couple of questions.

742
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:49,940
So there is for instance, try to find the commits the commit history.

743
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,840
Try to compare the commit history with the network graph and whether you are able to

744
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,480
find the branches.

745
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
Okay.

746
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,440
And I think when you forked, you only copied the main branch.

747
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:06,060
So in your fork, maybe there's only one, but then people can deselect it and they can get

748
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,060
all the branches.

749
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,060
Okay.

750
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:13,760
And then try to browse the recipes or try to find out when recipe was, for instance,

751
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,760
last modified.

752
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,980
We also have a question for you there on there is a guacamole recipe, and we want to find

753
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:29,820
out how many changes it received, which recipes contain the ingredient salt and who modified

754
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:35,860
the guacamole recipe last.

755
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:40,020
And so right now it's not about making any changes right now it's just browsing because

756
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:47,420
we will we will make changes we will make new commits in a later exercise approximately

757
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,580
one hour from now now it's just browsing.

758
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,040
So we're role playing that we're a new person starting a project and we're trying to figure

759
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,920
out what the status is, and who's last did stuff, and how I'm going to get started.

760
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
Okay.

761
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:07,280
And if you get stuck, there are hints, and below we have solution and walkthrough, and

762
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,720
what we will then later do with [name] once we return from exercise, and once we return

763
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,680
from break, based on the questions that people have, we might show you some of these steps

764
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,240
here also on stream.

765
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,080
So best way to participate now is to, you will now meet with your team or you work on

766
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,120
your own, go through these exercise steps one to eight.

767
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,840
And if you have questions, you can ask them in the notes, because we will be watching

768
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,080
them, we will be answering them.

769
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:42,240
And some of them, we will lift them up here to for discussion.

770
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,480
And I would like to start now the exercise, we will be back from the exercise 10 minutes

771
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,240
past the hour.

772
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,960
And then the only thing that we will do then is to announce a break.

773
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,960
Okay.

774
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,960
Okay.

775
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,920
Sounds good.

776
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,280
So see you in 20 minutes.

777
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,280
See you in 20 minutes.

778
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,280
Good luck.

779
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,280
Thank you.

780
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:03,780
Bye.

01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,300
you

819
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:30,000
All right, welcome back everybody.

820
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:39,720
In our studio here we have even, we have a little red light going on that we are live.

821
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,800
So hopefully this worked out.

822
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,880
Thanks a lot for all the questions that came in.

823
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:53,920
If you got stuck somewhere, don't worry about it, because we will now take a 10 minute break.

824
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,640
But after the break, [name] and me will go through some of the steps here on stream,

825
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,160
so you will also see them.

826
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:06,560
And then, after the break, we will not only browse a repository, we will now start to

827
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,520
make actually changes, we will start to make commits.

828
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:15,080
But let's take a 10 minute break and see you in 10 minutes for more Git.

829
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,800
Yeah, thanks.

830
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,800
See you later.

831
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,300
Bye.

832
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,580
you

833
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,580
you

834
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,580
you

835
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,580
you

836
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,580
you

837
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,580
you

838
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,580
you

839
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,580
you

840
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,580
you

841
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,580
you

842
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,580
you

843
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,580
you

844
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,580
you

845
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,580
you

846
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,580
you

847
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,580
you

848
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,580
you

849
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,580
you

850
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,580
you

851
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:38,520
All righty, we'll come back from the break.

852
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:43,340
We will do now more Git.

853
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:49,780
So far we have only browsed commits created by other people, but soon we will learn how

854
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:54,080
to really create our own commits.

855
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:58,060
Something we, I should have spent a little bit more time on, we didn't really comment

856
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:09,340
so much on this choice to work in GitHub or on VS Code or on the command line.

857
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:15,380
My recommendation for today is if you are new to Git or GitHub, go for GitHub work in

858
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,260
the browser.

859
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:20,380
All of today can be done in the browser.

860
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,360
Most of tomorrow can be done in a browser.

861
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:33,440
It's only tomorrow where we will teach how to move from the web repository to a local

862
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,440
repository.

863
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:39,920
So tomorrow we will have to choose between an editor and command line.

864
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,560
So tomorrow we will recommend to try VS Code.

865
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,900
But today we recommend to work in the GitHub track.

866
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:55,980
We offer these two other tracks for the participants who prefer to do these exercises in VS Code

867
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,720
or in command line.

868
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:02,020
So these are all different ways of doing the same thing, looking at the same data?

869
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:03,020
Yes.

870
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:04,020
That's the case.

871
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,020
Okay.

872
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:06,020
Okay.

873
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:11,580
And we recommend GitHub because we believe that it's maybe, maybe this is the easiest

874
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:18,380
way to kind of understand what, to have a mental representation of what's happening.

875
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:22,580
And then later it will make, maybe make you more confident to try the same things on the

876
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:25,460
command line.

877
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:31,260
And now before we start creating commits, we, we wanted to show you some of these steps

878
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,680
here and comment on them.

879
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,260
So we will spend five minutes on that.

880
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:39,500
And I will open up my fork.

881
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,020
Let me zoom in.

882
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,940
This is my fork of the recipe book.

883
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:47,580
How do I know that it's my fork?

884
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:57,240
it's it's under my username and I can even see where did I fork from

885
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,820
and now there were a couple of things we should we should do one thing was browse the commit

886
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:13,740
history and there is this clock symbol top right here so if I click here

887
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:17,900
At the time of when I created the fork, there are 32 commits,

888
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,580
there are 32 changes and we could browse them,

889
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,680
we could compare them.

890
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,380
The other thing that we were supposed to do

891
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,380
is to go on insights and network.

892
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,820
And now it's neat to do a little bit of thinking.

893
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:49,520
But what we will see here is a visual representation of, we will see little dots, which are the

894
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,780
commits.

895
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:59,080
So these little dots, each of these is a change.

896
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:05,520
But we also see that there have been branching, there have been some, some changes have happened

897
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:12,440
on branches, which have been later merged into the main branch.

898
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:20,920
And here are even some new branches appearing good

899
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,520
Back to the recipe book.

900
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,800
How do I know when a recipe was last modified?

901
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,160
Well, we could click on one of those, for instance.

902
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:39,520
Let's go into the sites and guacamole last last modified six months ago.

903
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,120
Which recipes include the ingredient salt?

904
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,720
Now, how many changes?

905
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:48,680
How many changes did the guacamole recipe have?

906
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,400
What happens if I click on the file?

907
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:57,360
And maybe I need to zoom out.

908
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,360
How can I see the history?

909
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,360
Is it this one?

910
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,200
Maybe the top right one?

911
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,840
Yeah.

912
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:09,640
So this one has been changed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times.

913
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:15,200
Which recipes include the ingredient salt?

914
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,760
It's this search magnifying thing here.

915
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:28,120
I can search for salt, for instance, and now it will search through the entire recipe book.

916
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:31,920
Except that I should have done that during the break, because it needs a few minutes

917
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:38,800
to create this search tree so i will skip that but you can i will go to the next which was

918
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,120
in the guacamole recipe we were supposed to figure out

919
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:52,320
who modified each line last and when and this is this blame feature

920
01:39:52,320 --> 01:40:02,880
The git annotation for each line of my recipe I know who modified it, when precisely, and

921
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:09,360
I can even have a look at each of these commits.

922
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:15,400
Question seven, can we, can you use these recipes yourself?

923
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:20,720
And the hint there is to look at license file and by using means, well, can I change that?

924
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:28,160
So there is a license and it's creative commons zero.

925
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:33,640
We will talk more about licenses next week.

926
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:37,400
Now I clicked on the license thingy here.

927
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:42,800
Anyway, more about licenses and what that means next week, but that's already a good

928
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,820
instinct to before taking somebody else's code to see is there even a license there

929
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:55,100
and what does it allow me to do? And then question eight in the upstream repository,

930
01:40:55,100 --> 01:41:00,740
what is upstream upstream is it's a this is how we call the original repository the one

931
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:12,540
that I forked from if I go back into there. So now there are issues and pull requests

932
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:16,220
And we will give more meaning to them in a bit.

933
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:22,780
But now we can already say that issues, it's a good place to keep track of problems, but

934
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,620
also suggestions, ideas.

935
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:29,900
So it's not, it doesn't only have to be a problem that we know about, it can hear I

936
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:35,580
earlier today, I shared an idea for, for recipe, and it can be a way to collect feedback before

937
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,660
I do the coding.

938
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:44,660
And pull requests, these are change proposals.

939
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:50,020
And we will now create some of those in the next exercise.

940
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:56,460
So this is now a mechanism to suggest changes, which can be within the same repository or

941
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:02,620
it can be from a fork towards the upstream repository.

942
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:06,860
And here earlier today, I made a suggestion for a vegetable soup.

943
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:13,860
And somebody else made a suggestion to improve the vegetarian lasagna.

944
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,860
Excellent.

945
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:26,660
But now we should go back to the material and take the next step and that is now we want

946
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:27,660
to create some commits.

947
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:33,620
We want to actually modify this repository and since we can, since it's now under your

948
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:38,420
user name.

949
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:42,340
So I will navigate to committing changes and let's make sure that you can see that too on

950
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,340
the notes.

951
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:53,540
Yes, I just can, thanks a lot.

952
01:42:53,540 --> 01:43:01,660
What we want to do here, we want to record new changes and we call them commits.

953
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:05,820
And we will do that on two separate branches.

954
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:08,960
And branches are these different development lines.

955
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,800
And we remember this image of these gophers.

956
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:18,600
So we will try to do something similar here.

957
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:22,840
And here is another sketch of what this exercise is about.

958
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:28,560
This exercise will happen on your fork.

959
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:35,240
And the first thing that you will do is you will create a new branch.

960
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:39,880
And in git, branches are like sticky notes, you can think of it, it's like a sticky note

961
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,760
that's that is referencing a commit.

962
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,680
Yeah, okay.

963
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:49,420
Wait, sticky note metaphor.

964
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,680
What does that mean exactly?

965
01:43:50,680 --> 01:44:02,720
So there's some history of commits and the branch, the sticky note refers to what exactly?

966
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:07,160
Like where?

967
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:16,680
So when we create a branch, it's like, it's like creating a different name for a commit.

968
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:24,080
So the first step will be to create this new branch, which will not yet create a new commit.

969
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,720
So this is the situation a.

970
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:32,240
How should we call the branch, we shouldn't call it your branch, or how do you call your

971
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,520
branches when you create one?

972
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:42,780
I mean, usually I call it something based on what I'm going to do there.

973
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:49,000
it might be like improve code or it might be a feature name if I'm adding a

974
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,520
feature usually something about what I'm planning to work on yeah so make it

975
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,400
descriptive so instead of your branch you will call it for instance I guess

976
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,920
the name of the recipe you're making exactly yeah so without spaces a lot of

977
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,920
speed and it will be a new salad or something yeah so step one will be

978
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,520
creating a new branch and again for most people we recommend to do that

979
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:16,240
directly on github but we also then show tracks on how to do it on the command

980
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:23,200
line how to do it in in vs code once you have the branch we ask you to create a

981
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:28,640
commit on the new branch and then create another one so two commits on the new

982
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:35,720
branch so this would be like you make a new recipe and then you fix something up

983
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:44,120
about the recipe. Like, you realize, ah, I needed to add this extra thing. Okay, yeah.

984
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:49,360
New recipe, modifying the ingredient, something like that. So we have a new branch, we have

985
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:57,000
two commits, and then your goal will be to switch back to main, the main branch, and

986
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,200
create a new commit there. And again, you can modify something, you can modify an existing

987
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:07,960
recipe. So after this exercise, we will have all created three commits. Yeah, two on a

988
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:16,920
new branch, one on the main main branch. And then Oh, and then you can browse you can see

989
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:28,720
whether if you remember if I go back to if I go back to just need to zoom out here on

990
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:38,100
insights, if you remember insights and network, you can browse the graph of your commits.

991
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:42,600
And you can then compare, does this look like what you just created?

992
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,600
Yeah.

993
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,600
So, okay.

994
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,600
Yeah.

995
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,020
So that's all the history.

996
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:53,340
So if we're role playing a young researcher here, I've started a new project, I've understood

997
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,340
it.

998
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:57,080
I want to contribute to it by adding my own recipe.

999
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:02,160
So I make a new branch and I start adding there, something there.

1000
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,680
So that way it doesn't get, it doesn't mess up what other people may have.

1001
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:12,680
And then at the same time, someone on the main branch does something different.

1002
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,680
Correct.

1003
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:14,680
Okay.

1004
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:21,720
And yeah, everything that we will do here is it only exists on your fork.

1005
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:30,080
So you don't have to be worried about you cannot you cannot break anything if so there

1006
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,240
are a few more like extra steps.

1007
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:37,880
At the end is to try to compare branches.

1008
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:43,080
And again, below we show solution and a walkthrough.

1009
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:47,680
We also ask you, you can try to rename a branch that you created, because maybe you change

1010
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,920
your mind about the name.

1011
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:58,400
try that. And then there is one more step and that is try to create a tag. So what is

1012
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:12,560
a tag? And on GitHub, it's called a release. A tag is very similar to a branch. But it's

1013
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,880
It's like a little sticky note that you

1014
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:22,120
want to put on a commit so that you, hm?

1015
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,640
Yeah.

1016
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:27,080
Can we say branches and tags all point

1017
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:32,080
to places in the history, but tags don't change?

1018
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,240
So the tag is like, this is the version

1019
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:40,080
that I submitted for this paper or something.

1020
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:44,000
And that's just a fact that will never change.

1021
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,280
It's like a milestone.

1022
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:48,280
So a typical tag could be a version number,

1023
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,280
like this is my version 2.0.

1024
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:54,000
Or it could be this is the submitted paper.

1025
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,400
This is the PhD version.

1026
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:02,720
This is the published code.

1027
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:08,600
So that will be, again, we will give you 20 minutes.

1028
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:13,800
step one to eight or one to nine you work on your fork again you can choose your favorite

1029
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:19,800
track again please ask us questions on the notes and before sending you to the exercise

1030
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:26,280
i'm also now just catching up on the notes to see if we missed some really important

1031
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:32,040
question that we should clarify i think we're doing pretty good um

1032
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:38,520
good and then we will be back in 20 minutes so we will give you 20 minutes for this exercise

1033
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:43,940
And in the last five minutes before the longer break, again, we will highlight some maybe

1034
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:46,100
tricky steps and discuss them here.

1035
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:47,100
Yeah.

1036
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,100
Okay.

1037
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,100
Great.

1038
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:55,260
So we'll keep answering the questions and see you 20 minutes.

1039
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,260
Here you can find the exercise.

1040
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:58,820
See you in 20 minutes.

1041
01:49:58,820 --> 01:49:59,820
Let's create some commits.

1042
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:02,340
Okay, bye.

1043
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,660

you

1063
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,660
you

1064
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,660
you

1065
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:10,660
you

1066
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:40,660

you

1069
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:10,660
you

1070
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:40,660
you

1071
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:10,660
you

1072
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:40,660
you

1073
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:10,660
you

1074
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:40,660
you

1075
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,660
you

1076
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,660
you

1077
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,660
you

1078
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,660
you

1079
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:25,520
Welcome back, everybody.

1080
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:30,860
We have five-ish minutes left before we take a longer break.

1081
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:38,300
And in this five minutes, we wanted to show you some of these steps and discuss and summarize.

1082
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:45,420
And before doing this, I wanted to show you in the notes below the exercise, we have this

1083
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:46,420
poll.

1084
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:52,740
You can use it also in future exercises to let us know how things are going, whether you

1085
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:56,540
are done, whether it's confusing, whether you are not trying.

1086
02:08:56,540 --> 02:09:03,300
This gives us an idea of how so that we can adjust better.

1087
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:06,720
So please let us know in future exercises.

1088
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:07,720
Yeah.

1089
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:14,000
And now I will go to my fork and [name], you tell me what I should do and what I should

1090
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
show.

1091
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Yeah.

1092
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,080
So this is my.

1093
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:21,500
So we're doing some stuff that's quite similar to the exercises.

1094
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:23,420
So first is making a new branch.

1095
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:28,120
So you've got a new idea for a recipe, I hear, and would like to contribute it.

1096
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:29,120
So yeah.

1097
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:30,120
Yeah.

1098
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,120
What is that idea?

1099
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,360
I'll show you how I create a branch here, which is.

1100
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:42,720
Here is this main branch symbol and this is, there are some other branches, but I can create

1101
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,720
a new one.

1102
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,720
Okay.

1103
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:52,000
I like to give branches somehow like my name because then I know who created them.

1104
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,080
And in this case, I want to improve pasta.

1105
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:56,080
Okay.

1106
02:09:56,080 --> 02:10:03,800
Great, this new branch, good.

1107
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:08,220
So now you can, or can you verify the new branch?

1108
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:09,480
And on here, I'm on it.

1109
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:13,280
So this is, if I would zoom out, it would have the full name.

1110
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:14,280
Okay.

1111
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:17,680
There was a really good question in the notes about this, how do you verify what branch

1112
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,680
you're on?

1113
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:23,200
And quite often a thing that can happen is people are using many branches and start doing

1114
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:25,080
stuff on the wrong branch.

1115
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:28,920
And you can sort of recover from that or just ignore it and go on.

1116
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:31,400
But it's good to pay attention to.

1117
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:33,860
Okay, so we're on the right branch.

1118
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:36,260
And now we make one commit for something.

1119
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:42,420
So I will go and I will try to improve this, this recipe here, which which is lacking instructions.

1120
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:43,420
I will add an instruction.

1121
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:44,420
Yeah.

1122
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,420
Uh huh.

1123
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:50,180
I will do it here directly on in the web, edit this file button.

1124
02:10:50,180 --> 02:11:05,540
And well, maybe we should start by saute the onion and mushrooms.

1125
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:06,780
And later, we need more instructions.

1126
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:08,780
But that's a good starting point.

1127
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:09,780
Yeah.

1128
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:10,780
Okay.

1129
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:12,780
But what to do now commit changes.

1130
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:17,860
So this this will now create this new commit.

1131
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:21,420
And here I verify on which branch I am.

1132
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:25,540
So this is another chance to for me to check that I really wanted to commit to this new

1133
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:26,540
branch.

1134
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:27,540
Good.

1135
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:32,820
I want to change this commit message because this is not very useful to Yes, I modified

1136
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:34,100
the file.

1137
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:37,100
It's much better to describe here in one line.

1138
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:38,100
What did I do?

1139
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:42,420
Why did I change it?

1140
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:52,140
So I starting to improve the instructions for this recipe.

1141
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:57,020
And here, if I wanted, I could add more context, if I'm more explanation, I could refer to

1142
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:58,020
an issue.

1143
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,020
But I think here, we are happy.

1144
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:00,020
Well, do we want to commit?

1145
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:01,020
Yes, let's commit.

1146
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:08,780
What should I do next?

1147
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:12,060
Can we verify the commit in the network?

1148
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:19,060
So how did I find it? It was top insights sites. Yeah, and network loading, loading,

1149
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:25,660
loading. I think a couple of other people also reported that things take a little bit

1150
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:35,740
of time. Yeah. But this is a chance to catch up with questions. Here we go. Oh, yeah, there's

1151
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:40,220
a lot of people working now. So all these different commits here. Very cool. And here

1152
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:47,820
is mine. Oh, can you zoom in some? Does it scale properly? Does that basically say the

1153
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:55,260
name you just made? Yeah, I wonder what this is now. Yeah, so it's this green, green little

1154
02:12:55,260 --> 02:13:00,140
dot is my new commit. Okay. And if I tilt my head, I can read that this is this vegetable

1155
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:07,020
soup soup branch. Is that what I wanted? No, that's not what I wanted. We that's wrong.

1156
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:08,260
I created, this is the new one.

1157
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:09,060
There we go.

1158
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:09,540
OK.

1159
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:10,420
improved-pasta

1160
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:11,580
Yes.

1161
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:15,540
And the other essential thing is I

1162
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:19,340
think the main branch didn't change.

1163
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:23,580
And these little labels that are sticking next to the commits,

1164
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:25,580
this is what I was referring to as sticky notes.

1165
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:27,540
So these are the branch names.

1166
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:34,140
The other observation is that I created

1167
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:41,780
a new commit and a new branch in my fork which didn't so everybody else can see that it exists

1168
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:48,360
but it doesn't it doesn't appear in in the forks of the other people this we will do

1169
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:55,900
after the longer break on we will learn how how do we really know sent changes both how

1170
02:13:55,900 --> 02:14:01,740
do we merge them into the main branch and how do we even make change suggestions across

1171
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:07,620
repositories. This will be later. Yeah. I think we wanted to show one more kind of fun

1172
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:19,140
thing. And that is to whoops, to compare branches. For this, I will just zoom out a little bit.

1173
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:22,900
So if you take a repository, and at the end, you add a compare

1174
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:36,900
Okay, and we can choose two repositories and two branches there.

1175
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:42,580
So basically, we can see what's the difference between the main branch and your new improved

1176
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:44,620
pasta branch, for example.

1177
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:46,900
Yeah, this one.

1178
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:47,900
Okay.

1179
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:53,580
So the difference between main branch and the improved pasta branch is, well, these

1180
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:56,840
two lines were added and this line got removed.

1181
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:00,420
So the red is what got removed, green is what got added.

1182
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:01,420
Yeah.

1183
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:02,420
Okay.

1184
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:03,420
Good.

1185
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:08,980
There was more in the exercise and there is more on the page.

1186
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:09,980
Yeah.

1187
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:10,980
Yeah.

1188
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:18,660
there's a lot of good questions coming in which um let's see is there anything we need

1189
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:26,980
to answer for everyone some still need answers there in the timeline what's the

1190
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:33,300
horizontal axis is it minutes or arbitrary or whatever in the

1191
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:38,340
on the network uh

1192
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:52,740
yes in the network so here the timeline is it's chronologically ordered yeah once

1193
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:59,700
it's loads okay so there are a couple of more questions on the so here this is

1194
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:05,940
chronologically so time time axis very good questions on the bottom we will

1195
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:13,380
answer them. Yeah. But I recommend that we take now this 60 minute break. This is this

1196
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:19,100
has been designed because, well, most participants are in Central Europe. And this is aligns

1197
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:23,700
well with the lunch break. But thanks for everybody else in different time zones to

1198
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:30,980
follow for following. And so we will be back in 60 minutes. And then we will then our goal

1199
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:37,460
will be to learn how to combine these changes from different branches merging

1200
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:44,060
changes and contributing to a project yeah that's the goal for the remaining

1201
02:16:44,060 --> 02:16:49,420
one and a half hours which we will do after the one hour break there's one

1202
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:54,820
questions about showing the compare function again but do we have time to do

1203
02:16:54,820 --> 02:17:05,440
Yeah, because I think the part that went quickly, I will just navigate back to my repository.

1204
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:13,420
So one was, you take any repository name and at the end, edit or compare, enter.

1205
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:18,500
But the other thing that was a little bit quickly is that you can choose not only which

1206
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:22,980
branch, but also which repository.

1207
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:26,600
So here, the first thing I did is I wanted to compare within my own repository.

1208
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:31,780
So I selected my repository here.

1209
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:36,020
And now it's changed a bit because now it just asked me which branch to which branch.

1210
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:41,020
And now I can select which branch I want to compare.

1211
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:42,020
Yeah.

1212
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:43,020
Good.

1213
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:44,020
Okay.

1214
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:52,180
We will be back in 56 minutes, or should we do say 60 minutes 56 minutes just to make it

1215
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:56,640
easier for those who want to join and we're not here in the morning and then

1216
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:02,280
we will do some some merges yeah and you can keep asking questions we don't

1217
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:11,160
promise to answer during the break but might if we have time so yes great

1218
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:17,200
hopefully see you soon yeah excellent work everybody see you in a bit have a

1219
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:20,640
good break thank you bye

1327
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:54,240
you

1328
03:12:22,180 --> 03:12:24,240
you

1329
03:12:52,180 --> 03:12:54,240
you

1330
03:13:22,180 --> 03:13:47,180
Hi everybody. Hope you had the possibility to take a break and I will also just take

1331
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:55,060
here a few minutes for a few moments for everybody to settle. We have one and a half hour left

1332
03:13:55,060 --> 03:13:59,900
to do a bit more with Git and version control. In this remaining one and a half hours, we

1333
03:13:59,900 --> 03:14:10,380
will also take there will be another break. Roughly 55 minutes from now. And we will hear

1334
03:14:10,380 --> 03:14:14,020
we will continue where we left off before the break. And the place where we left off

1335
03:14:14,020 --> 03:14:18,980
is that we copied a repository full of recipes.

1336
03:14:18,980 --> 03:14:21,140
I'm switching to your screen.

1337
03:14:21,140 --> 03:14:21,660
Is that good?

1338
03:14:21,660 --> 03:14:22,220
Oh, yeah.

1339
03:14:22,220 --> 03:14:24,060
Yes, please do.

1340
03:14:24,060 --> 03:14:25,820
OK.

1341
03:14:25,820 --> 03:14:28,060
There you go.

1342
03:14:28,060 --> 03:14:31,740
So here is where we left off just before the break.

1343
03:14:31,740 --> 03:14:37,020
We copied an existing repository full of recipes.

1344
03:14:37,020 --> 03:14:38,780
We created a branch.

1345
03:14:38,780 --> 03:14:42,420
and on the new branch, we created one or two commits.

1346
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:48,100
It's, if you didn't manage to get that far,

1347
03:14:48,100 --> 03:14:50,940
it's not a problem because in the remaining exercise,

1348
03:14:50,940 --> 03:14:52,780
you will have time to catch up there.

1349
03:14:53,700 --> 03:14:55,820
But what we now want to do in the remaining time

1350
03:14:55,820 --> 03:15:00,820
is to learn how to merge these branches back into main.

1351
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:06,120
So in more explicitly, this, your branch,

1352
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:14,400
in my case, it was some pasta improvement. Now I'm happy with it. And I would like to

1353
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:21,960
now find a way to propose to, to merge this development back into the main branch. Yeah.

1354
03:15:21,960 --> 03:15:25,720
And for this, I will now just zoom out so that everybody knows where I will navigate

1355
03:15:25,720 --> 03:15:32,520
next. And we will, let's paste it also in the notes. Okay. I will now navigate to the

1356
03:15:32,520 --> 03:15:38,600
next episode which is merging changes and contributing to the project.

1357
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:44,440
Okay, it is in the notes.

1358
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:46,080
And thanks also for all the questions.

1359
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:49,800
Some still need an answer but we will get there.

1360
03:15:49,800 --> 03:15:57,480
So the goal now for us is that we want to learn about this thing called pull request.

1361
03:15:57,480 --> 03:16:06,640
The name is historical, but whenever I hear pull request, I think change proposal.

1362
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:10,200
So we will be saying pull request, pull request, pull request, pull request, and then everybody

1363
03:16:10,200 --> 03:16:14,800
will think change proposal, change proposal, change proposal, change proposal.

1364
03:16:14,800 --> 03:16:16,880
It's a mechanism to propose changes.

1365
03:16:16,880 --> 03:16:21,200
It's a mechanism to merge branches together.

1366
03:16:21,200 --> 03:16:27,880
And we will do that within our own repositories.

1367
03:16:27,880 --> 03:16:36,040
And maybe accidentally, maybe we will accidentally send a change proposal across repositories

1368
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:37,040
to the upstream.

1369
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:38,480
And that's okay, too.

1370
03:16:38,480 --> 03:16:42,200
Because that will be interesting, too.

1371
03:16:42,200 --> 03:16:50,560
So in our, like, okay, like to clarify pull request a little bit in my mind, you said

1372
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:55,160
it's like change proposal in this role-playing thing, like I'm a new person that's joined

1373
03:16:55,160 --> 03:17:01,000
a research group and I'm doing something, when would the pull request and change proposals

1374
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:02,000
be useful?

1375
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:09,280
Like, when would I use one and when would I not use one, for example?

1376
03:17:09,280 --> 03:17:19,280
yeah to answer a question maybe I will use this image here which illustrates a

1377
03:17:19,280 --> 03:17:28,160
bit what we tried to do so here I tried to propose a change I want to have to

1378
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:31,520
change on the main branch I want to have this improved pasta recipe on the main

1379
03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:38,640
branch but I didn't do it directly on the main branch I first did it on my on

1380
03:17:38,640 --> 03:17:42,000
on my improved pasta branch.

1381
03:17:42,880 --> 03:17:47,420
And now I suggest somebody to actually review this change.

1382
03:17:47,420 --> 03:17:51,420
So the role, the situation here might be

1383
03:17:51,420 --> 03:17:54,980
that we are maybe two people or more,

1384
03:17:54,980 --> 03:17:58,620
maybe it's us two who collaborate on a research project.

1385
03:17:58,620 --> 03:18:01,060
We are both working within this repository.

1386
03:18:01,060 --> 03:18:03,780
And one situation could be that maybe I would like you

1387
03:18:03,780 --> 03:18:06,100
to review this change before it goes in

1388
03:18:06,100 --> 03:18:07,420
and give me your comments.

1389
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:13,100
So it's like a big code that many people are working on and I'm doing something but I'm

1390
03:18:13,100 --> 03:18:19,060
not confident it will work or it's correct and don't want to take any risks.

1391
03:18:19,060 --> 03:18:20,060
Okay.

1392
03:18:20,060 --> 03:18:21,060
Yeah.

1393
03:18:21,060 --> 03:18:22,060
It could be that.

1394
03:18:22,060 --> 03:18:23,060
It could be about avoiding risk and getting feedback.

1395
03:18:23,060 --> 03:18:26,020
It could also be that I just want to inform you about this change.

1396
03:18:26,020 --> 03:18:28,780
So it could be that, well, we are, it doesn't have to be a big thing.

1397
03:18:28,780 --> 03:18:31,860
It can be a small project and it's maybe just us two.

1398
03:18:31,860 --> 03:18:33,580
But I would like you to know about it.

1399
03:18:33,580 --> 03:18:37,700
So now I can send the pull request, the change proposal, and I can involve you in it.

1400
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:38,700
Yeah.

1401
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:43,780
So simply a way to have everyone know what's going on without surprises, even if you already

1402
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:46,420
know what you're doing, basically.

1403
03:18:46,420 --> 03:18:47,420
Yeah.

1404
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:48,420
Okay.

1405
03:18:48,420 --> 03:18:53,140
So I like to, for me, that's actually this, like, collaborative learning and knowledge

1406
03:18:53,140 --> 03:18:59,860
transfer is even more important than, like, the quality part of it, the quality assurance.

1407
03:18:59,860 --> 03:19:00,860
Yeah.

1408
03:19:00,860 --> 03:19:07,660
The it can also be useful if you are just on your own because then maybe I wasn't sure

1409
03:19:07,660 --> 03:19:11,260
myself whether this will work out but I will be happy with the recipe and here I am happy

1410
03:19:11,260 --> 03:19:17,500
with the recipe and I just want to integrate it back into main and I will use this mechanism

1411
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:18,980
called pull request.

1412
03:19:18,980 --> 03:19:19,980
Yeah.

1413
03:19:19,980 --> 03:19:27,260
Oh, we again we offer to do that in the browser or in VS code or in a command line.

1414
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:28,260
Yeah.

1415
03:19:28,260 --> 03:19:31,020
who will follow in the command line,

1416
03:19:31,020 --> 03:19:32,940
they will notice that this is a lot easier

1417
03:19:32,940 --> 03:19:34,700
because for them, it's just a command.

1418
03:19:34,700 --> 03:19:37,860
It will be one command, enter, and it's merged.

1419
03:19:39,580 --> 03:19:42,580
But we still recommend most participants to follow,

1420
03:19:42,580 --> 03:19:43,420
to do this on GitHub.

1421
03:19:43,420 --> 03:19:45,660
On GitHub, it will be a few clicks.

1422
03:19:47,580 --> 03:19:51,980
But the nice thing is that it will already prepare us

1423
03:19:51,980 --> 03:19:54,080
for how collaboration works

1424
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:57,860
because when we collaborate on GitHub or GitLab,

1425
03:19:57,860 --> 03:19:59,900
It's the same mechanism.

1426
03:19:59,900 --> 03:20:04,220
It is always through these change proposals.

1427
03:20:04,220 --> 03:20:05,820
It's always through these pull requests.

1428
03:20:05,820 --> 03:20:08,820
So this mechanism that we will practice today,

1429
03:20:08,820 --> 03:20:11,220
although we are maybe alone, and although it's just

1430
03:20:11,220 --> 03:20:13,700
my own repository, it will prepare us

1431
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:14,780
for when we collaborate.

1432
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:16,940
And we will collaborate.

1433
03:20:16,940 --> 03:20:19,180
We will learn a lot about collaboration this Thursday.

1434
03:20:22,220 --> 03:20:23,420
Yeah.

1435
03:20:23,420 --> 03:20:27,820
And I think there was a previous question before lunch

1436
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:32,380
That said, how do I know what branch I'm on?

1437
03:20:32,380 --> 03:20:35,660
And this is where this starts to become really important.

1438
03:20:35,660 --> 03:20:38,940
If you think you're working on your branch,

1439
03:20:38,940 --> 03:20:41,260
like in this picture here,

1440
03:20:41,260 --> 03:20:43,300
but you're actually on the main branch,

1441
03:20:43,300 --> 03:20:46,380
stuff starts to get really weird and confusing.

1442
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:47,740
And you have to look at the network view

1443
03:20:47,740 --> 03:20:48,620
to sort things out.

1444
03:20:48,620 --> 03:20:53,180
So yeah, it's good to, when you're doing this,

1445
03:20:53,180 --> 03:20:56,380
stop, think, am I on the right branch?

1446
03:20:56,380 --> 03:20:57,220
And then do it.

1447
03:20:57,820 --> 03:21:04,900
And in approximately five minutes, we will then start another exercise.

1448
03:21:04,900 --> 03:21:08,940
But before that, we want to prepare you for what to expect.

1449
03:21:08,940 --> 03:21:17,660
There are also some possible traps, and we will show you what to expect and what to avoid.

1450
03:21:17,660 --> 03:21:20,460
But really, our goal will be what this illustration shows.

1451
03:21:20,460 --> 03:21:22,900
Our goal will be to do two steps.

1452
03:21:22,900 --> 03:21:29,560
step is open up a pull request open up a change proposal and in the second step

1453
03:21:29,560 --> 03:21:36,000
we will accept it okay so so we're change we make the proposal and we

1454
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:45,280
accepted ourselves possible yes okay okay and it could happen that at the end

1455
03:21:45,280 --> 03:21:50,980
of the exercise if somebody wants more and if somebody wants to have some bonus

1456
03:21:50,980 --> 03:21:57,300
exercise they can try to send a pull request across repositories not to their main branch

1457
03:21:57,300 --> 03:22:03,380
but to our main branch to the upstream yeah and then we will we will see the changes also

1458
03:22:03,380 --> 03:22:10,140
in the in the original repository and this already gives us a starting point it will

1459
03:22:10,140 --> 03:22:15,980
set us up for collaboration and if it happens accidentally that's also okay so i think some

1460
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:19,980
people will accidentally send the pull request to the upstream repository and that's fine

1461
03:22:19,980 --> 03:22:32,100
do yeah it also happen that you modify the same file and the same portion of the file

1462
03:22:32,100 --> 03:22:39,180
in two different ways on your branch and on main it might happen so some of you might

1463
03:22:39,180 --> 03:22:46,900
see a conflict in this exercise and if you do don't panic because we will be the last

1464
03:22:46,900 --> 03:22:52,720
half an hour of today we will discuss conflicts why why they happen why they are good a good

1465
03:22:52,720 --> 03:22:56,960
thing and how to solve them but that will be a demonstration so in the last half an

1466
03:22:56,960 --> 03:23:02,400
hour [name] and me will we will create a conflict on github and we will show you how

1467
03:23:02,400 --> 03:23:15,480
you can solve it okay let me just i will just make sure that i didn't forget anything

1468
03:23:15,480 --> 03:23:24,220
essential before we send you to the exercise we wanted to show you what to

1469
03:23:24,220 --> 03:23:27,620
what to be careful about when when opening up a request so that will be

1470
03:23:27,620 --> 03:23:33,940
part of the exercise but I wanted to demonstrate it I will know so now

1471
03:23:33,940 --> 03:23:38,060
please just watch yeah okay and you will have a chance to do the same thing then

1472
03:23:38,060 --> 03:23:42,380
as part of the exercise okay yeah I know we start here in my

1473
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:52,460
repository. Your copy of the repository. Exactly, it's my copy. Before the break I

1474
03:23:52,460 --> 03:23:59,780
created this branch with one commit in my case. If you don't have it yet,

1475
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:06,340
you can create it in the exercise, I still have it. And one way to open up

1476
03:24:06,340 --> 03:24:15,540
this pull request is to click here so the branch is already made and we yeah it

1477
03:24:15,540 --> 03:24:19,980
remembers we've made a branch recently so yeah since I'm logged in github now

1478
03:24:19,980 --> 03:24:29,820
anticipates that well probably I want to create a pull request yeah so then I can

1479
03:24:29,820 --> 03:24:35,580
click here but the the tricky part here is that now we have to be very careful

1480
03:24:35,580 --> 03:24:45,580
where is this change proposal coming from and where is it going to

1481
03:24:45,580 --> 03:24:50,340
so there is this base repository and head repository and there is the base branch and

1482
03:24:50,340 --> 03:24:56,900
this branch here and what this means is that this change proposal is supposed to go from

1483
03:24:56,900 --> 03:25:04,180
my branch towards main it's like the direction that arrow is pointing so

1484
03:25:04,180 --> 03:25:08,780
And I think if I zoomed out, it would be more intuitive, but harder for you to read now

1485
03:25:08,780 --> 03:25:11,540
and stream.

1486
03:25:11,540 --> 03:25:15,100
But the thing to double check here is, where do you want to send it to?

1487
03:25:15,100 --> 03:25:19,380
Do you want to send it upstream towards the original repository?

1488
03:25:19,380 --> 03:25:21,900
No, in this case, no.

1489
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:23,600
It's okay if it happens accidentally.

1490
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:31,380
But in this case, what you what you will want to do is to change this towards your repository.

1491
03:25:31,380 --> 03:25:32,600
Okay.

1492
03:25:32,600 --> 03:25:37,920
And once I do that, it's now it looks easier.

1493
03:25:37,920 --> 03:25:42,480
And now, yes, from my improved pasta, yes, towards the main branch.

1494
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:43,480
Okay.

1495
03:25:43,480 --> 03:25:46,880
So main will collect the changes in improved pasta.

1496
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:49,080
To say it again.

1497
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:50,080
Okay.

1498
03:25:50,080 --> 03:25:51,080
Yep.

1499
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:55,560
And the other thing you can double check before.

1500
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:59,000
Before writing the title before writing a description and before creating this change

1501
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:04,360
proposal, I normally double check, I scroll down here. And I can see I can actually see

1502
03:26:04,360 --> 03:26:10,240
the change. So this should look somehow familiar to you. If this looks like a completely different

1503
03:26:10,240 --> 03:26:18,240
change than you thought, then I go back and double check whether this is really correct.

1504
03:26:18,240 --> 03:26:22,660
Okay.

1505
03:26:22,660 --> 03:26:23,660
Back to the exercise.

1506
03:26:23,660 --> 03:26:24,660
So two things.

1507
03:26:24,660 --> 03:26:29,360
Open a pull request.

1508
03:26:29,360 --> 03:26:31,680
And then merge it.

1509
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:39,300
And after the merge, again, you can browse the network of branches.

1510
03:26:39,300 --> 03:26:44,660
And you should also, you should be able to see your improved recipe or your new recipe

1511
03:26:44,660 --> 03:26:49,420
should now be on your main branch.

1512
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:53,180
And after the exercise, [name] and me will will then go through some of the key steps

1513
03:26:53,180 --> 03:27:02,220
here and discuss discuss maybe some possibilities that we didn't want to point out at this point

1514
03:27:02,220 --> 03:27:03,220
yet.

1515
03:27:03,220 --> 03:27:04,220
Yeah.

1516
03:27:04,220 --> 03:27:11,580
Okay, let's just make sure that we have that in the notes.

1517
03:27:11,580 --> 03:27:14,140
And we do.

1518
03:27:14,140 --> 03:27:21,420
So now scrolling to the end of the document, at the end of the document you can find where

1519
03:27:21,420 --> 03:27:24,220
the exercise is.

1520
03:27:24,220 --> 03:27:26,900
If you don't have any commits yet, if you don't have a branch yet, you can still create

1521
03:27:26,900 --> 03:27:27,900
it.

1522
03:27:27,900 --> 03:27:28,900
Yeah.

1523
03:27:28,900 --> 03:27:32,560
And please also let us know here how it's going, whether it's you already or whether

1524
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:37,700
you are confused or whether you wish there was more time.

1525
03:27:37,700 --> 03:27:46,660
And our plan is to be back 35 minutes past the hour.

1526
03:27:46,660 --> 03:27:54,900
Okay, and if people can't do this, is that okay?

1527
03:27:54,900 --> 03:27:58,620
Does anything else depend on it right now?

1528
03:27:58,620 --> 03:28:05,220
So if if people get stuck, I would say, write us some questions, look at some questions,

1529
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:06,940
not a problem at all.

1530
03:28:06,940 --> 03:28:11,860
meet again here on stream. Because we will go through all the key steps. All the rest

1531
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:18,980
of today will be demonstration and everything tomorrow doesn't depend on it. Tomorrow one

1532
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:27,660
can restart even if today something failed. Yeah, okay. Great. See you all in 20 minutes.

1533
03:28:27,660 --> 03:28:31,660
Good luck. And please keep the questions coming. Bye.

you

1573
03:48:06,940 --> 03:48:09,000
you

1574
03:48:36,940 --> 03:48:47,480
Welcome back, back from exercise and thanks so much for giving us here live feedback on

1575
03:48:47,480 --> 03:48:48,480
how it's going.

1576
03:48:48,480 --> 03:48:54,540
So based on this, it seems that it went pretty well.

1577
03:48:54,540 --> 03:49:02,360
And the goal of this exercise was open a pull request and merge.

1578
03:49:02,360 --> 03:49:08,880
And if you did it purely within VS code or purely on the command line, then a pull request

1579
03:49:08,880 --> 03:49:09,880
wasn't necessary.

1580
03:49:09,880 --> 03:49:17,680
You could merge these changes locally without going through GitHub.

1581
03:49:17,680 --> 03:49:24,560
Should I show how to do this and then we can maybe discuss some of the key steps in there?

1582
03:49:24,560 --> 03:49:25,560
Sounds good.

1583
03:49:25,560 --> 03:49:26,560
Okay.

1584
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:27,560
So what do you show first?

1585
03:49:27,560 --> 03:49:33,800
Yeah, I will navigate back to my my copy. In during the exercise, I created one more

1586
03:49:33,800 --> 03:49:37,880
commit. So I'm still on my like pasta improvement branch. But now there are two commits.

1587
03:49:38,600 --> 03:49:45,720
And I would like to get them back domain. So I'm here. If I

1588
03:49:48,200 --> 03:49:54,280
reload, yes, five minutes ago, there was another change. Okay. And let me open up the request.

1589
03:49:57,560 --> 03:50:01,640
And before the exercise we show that it's now important to double-check where is it

1590
03:50:01,640 --> 03:50:08,940
going from and where is it going to and I want I want the pull request to to stay within

1591
03:50:08,940 --> 03:50:14,800
my repository.

1592
03:50:14,800 --> 03:50:19,600
And I double-check that it's from the branch that I thought I want to send from and towards

1593
03:50:19,600 --> 03:50:25,000
the main that looks pretty good it also tells me that it's able to merge so there won't

1594
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:31,920
be any conflicts we will come we will create a conflict a little bit later

1595
03:50:32,080 --> 03:50:39,160
yeah okay what else should I do here you need to describe it anyhow yeah this is

1596
03:50:39,160 --> 03:50:44,080
maybe not a great description improve pasta it's not very specific yeah so I

1597
03:50:44,080 --> 03:50:52,400
like to give make this a little bit clearer that I added two concrete steps

1598
03:50:52,400 --> 03:51:06,680
to the instructions or boscaiola that could be a bit more context here I also

1599
03:51:06,680 --> 03:51:12,680
like to double-check which commits are part of this change proposal these two

1600
03:51:12,680 --> 03:51:22,920
And what is the change this one down here this looks all pretty good

1601
03:51:22,920 --> 03:51:27,440
before opening it up we wanted to tell you that there is you can actually choose there

1602
03:51:27,440 --> 03:51:34,320
is something called draft request that can be useful to know it can be a really neat

1603
03:51:34,320 --> 03:51:40,360
little feature is that sometimes I want to inform my collaborator in this case [name]

1604
03:51:40,360 --> 03:51:45,480
it I have I'm working on a change but it's actually not it's not finished yet I don't

1605
03:51:45,480 --> 03:51:48,920
want it to be merged but I would like you to look at it I would like you to know it

1606
03:51:48,920 --> 03:51:56,640
know about it and maybe give me feedback so this can be useful for let me click on it

1607
03:51:56,640 --> 03:52:06,440
I will create a draft request because then if I open the draft request it's here on top

1608
03:52:06,440 --> 03:52:10,080
left it's marked as draft it's not meant to be merged it's not even possible to

1609
03:52:10,080 --> 03:52:15,560
merge so I we cannot accidentally click here and merge but I can already collect

1610
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:23,160
feedback and once I'm ready with should I make a comment on there yeah yes

1611
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:26,520
please please comment on it

1612
03:52:26,520 --> 03:52:41,000
Okay, I've found it, I'm opening it and you should see something appear there.

1613
03:52:41,000 --> 03:52:45,440
Because then this way we can actually have a conversation here.

1614
03:52:45,440 --> 03:52:49,880
Oh, look, there it appears.

1615
03:52:49,880 --> 03:52:50,920
Yeah.

1616
03:52:50,920 --> 03:52:54,600
So here we could talk about it, clarify things.

1617
03:52:54,600 --> 03:53:02,960
We will also tomorrow and on Thursday, I'll show you how you can then how I can make them

1618
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:05,600
improvements to my change proposal.

1619
03:53:05,600 --> 03:53:08,520
I will leave that out for now.

1620
03:53:08,520 --> 03:53:16,040
But once this is really ready for review and meaning ready to be merged, I can market ready.

1621
03:53:16,040 --> 03:53:19,420
Then it's not draft anymore, it's open.

1622
03:53:19,420 --> 03:53:24,000
And now if we are more people in the project, I would actually like somebody else to merge

1623
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:31,160
it not not just me if I'm on my own I'm also the one with the one person

1624
03:53:31,160 --> 03:53:39,060
reviewing and here before clicking so now the the change proposal is open but

1625
03:53:39,060 --> 03:53:43,860
it's not merged yet before clicking here I again wanted to show you because

1626
03:53:43,860 --> 03:53:51,900
somebody asked about it that also here we have several options I can do the

1627
03:53:51,900 --> 03:53:56,680
defaulting there is also something called squash squashing what it would do

1628
03:53:56,680 --> 03:54:03,540
is it would it would combine these two commits that I had into one so after

1629
03:54:03,540 --> 03:54:08,260
it's merged it would show up as one single commit and then there is also

1630
03:54:08,260 --> 03:54:14,660
something called rebase which is which is an alternative to a merge so instead

1631
03:54:14,660 --> 03:54:24,940
of creating a merge commit, it would, it would move the new commits behind the main branch.

1632
03:54:24,940 --> 03:54:27,300
We will not go into much too much detail here.

1633
03:54:27,300 --> 03:54:35,900
Yeah. So they're like all different ways of managing the network. But I guess people should

1634
03:54:35,900 --> 03:54:40,620
stick with merge commit to be simple until there's.

1635
03:54:40,620 --> 03:54:48,580
Fully agree and later I think people can experiment so later on your own in this example repository

1636
03:54:48,580 --> 03:54:55,540
you can also test out the other options right now we just wanted you to know that these exist

1637
03:54:55,540 --> 03:55:03,100
and then I will now merge confirm and as soon as I click here now the two commits are part

1638
03:55:03,100 --> 03:55:07,740
of the main branch.

1639
03:55:07,740 --> 03:55:08,740
What is this here?

1640
03:55:08,740 --> 03:55:09,740
Delete branch.

1641
03:55:09,740 --> 03:55:10,740
What will it do?

1642
03:55:10,740 --> 03:55:14,940
Does it delete the commits or does it delete the branch pointer?

1643
03:55:14,940 --> 03:55:15,940
Yeah.

1644
03:55:15,940 --> 03:55:21,600
So it, it doesn't, it does not delete the commits and I can, I can demonstrate it.

1645
03:55:21,600 --> 03:55:22,600
I will show you what it does.

1646
03:55:22,600 --> 03:55:24,940
Maybe let's duplicate this tab.

1647
03:55:24,940 --> 03:55:33,300
I will now navigate to insights and network and I will try to find the merge commit that

1648
03:55:33,300 --> 03:55:36,300
I just created.

1649
03:55:36,300 --> 03:55:41,520
And now it needs to do a little bit of thinking because now it's we were many people doing

1650
03:55:41,520 --> 03:55:44,900
many changes which is wonderful.

1651
03:55:44,900 --> 03:55:53,240
But the one that I the one that I just created is this one.

1652
03:55:53,240 --> 03:55:57,400
And I merged from this, this branch here, which is maybe hard for you to read, but it's

1653
03:55:57,400 --> 03:55:59,980
a sort of on slash improve pasta.

1654
03:55:59,980 --> 03:56:05,380
And it points to the commit just before the merge commit.

1655
03:56:05,380 --> 03:56:11,500
And now if I go back here, and if I delete the branch, delete it, it will not delete

1656
03:56:11,500 --> 03:56:12,500
any commits.

1657
03:56:12,500 --> 03:56:22,440
But if I reload this, we will see what happens.

1658
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:32,620
many questions coming in this is perfect the commits are still there this one is

1659
03:56:32,620 --> 03:56:36,800
still there and the other one is still there but the only thing that

1660
03:56:36,800 --> 03:56:45,320
disappeared is this sticky note yes to this one so hopefully now we understand

1661
03:56:45,320 --> 03:56:54,500
little bit better what what branches are in git and what we can do now if we

1662
03:56:54,500 --> 03:56:59,820
think that this would be interesting we could also look into the upstream

1663
03:56:59,820 --> 03:57:05,260
repository which is the original repository that we that I forked from

1664
03:57:05,260 --> 03:57:10,500
and see if someone has maybe made a pull request there for us to look and yes

1665
03:57:10,500 --> 03:57:13,880
Yes, there are. Great.

1666
03:57:13,880 --> 03:57:14,880
So what

1667
03:57:14,880 --> 03:57:20,080
Some of them accidental, some of them willing, but this is awesome, isn't it?

1668
03:57:20,080 --> 03:57:24,120
Yeah, what do each of these mean?

1669
03:57:24,120 --> 03:57:25,120
So it's

1670
03:57:25,120 --> 03:57:27,600
Okay, you need to you need to speak.

1671
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:29,680
Okay, I will take over here. So what the

1672
03:57:29,680 --> 03:57:36,880
What the it's the same thing that we did before. But instead of doing the pull requests within

1673
03:57:36,880 --> 03:57:40,440
the repository here, then there are 10 pull requests

1674
03:57:40,440 --> 03:57:45,440
which are from your fork towards this original repository.

1675
03:57:46,560 --> 03:57:48,920
And now you have a mechanism at your hands

1676
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:53,920
to suggest changes to any open source repository

1677
03:57:55,840 --> 03:57:57,080
on GitHub or GitLab.

1678
03:57:59,040 --> 03:58:04,040
And I can maybe look at some of those.

1679
03:58:06,880 --> 03:58:10,920
This is one that I created earlier today.

1680
03:58:16,360 --> 03:58:18,120
One interesting happening,

1681
03:58:18,120 --> 03:58:19,920
one thing that is interesting here

1682
03:58:21,840 --> 03:58:26,840
is that it has this keyword here

1683
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:31,000
and we will return to it tomorrow and on Thursday.

1684
03:58:32,060 --> 03:58:36,200
So in a change proposal, I can even refer to issues.

1685
03:58:36,200 --> 03:58:38,920
This is the issue number three.

1686
03:58:38,920 --> 03:58:41,640
What was in the issue number three?

1687
03:58:41,640 --> 03:58:45,380
In an issue number three, I was sharing an idea.

1688
03:58:45,380 --> 03:58:50,940
And I open an issue so that I can collect feedback before even starting the work.

1689
03:58:50,940 --> 03:58:54,400
So that's one thing I can do with pull requests, I can then refer to discussions that happened

1690
03:58:54,400 --> 03:59:01,240
before and cross reference things.

1691
03:59:01,240 --> 03:59:03,180
And I will maybe merge this one.

1692
03:59:03,180 --> 03:59:07,900
I looked at it before, it's a nice recipe for a kebab.

1693
03:59:07,900 --> 03:59:17,060
Maybe the one thing I would improve that would make my work easier would be a pull request

1694
03:59:17,060 --> 03:59:21,180
of a better title.

1695
03:59:21,180 --> 03:59:24,940
We also have this thing here, approve and run.

1696
03:59:24,940 --> 03:59:31,820
I have a feeling we'll learn about that next week.

1697
03:59:31,820 --> 03:59:32,820
But this is just a preview.

1698
03:59:32,820 --> 03:59:37,820
So we have here sneakily in this repository

1699
03:59:39,380 --> 03:59:43,060
and maybe you can all find it, there is a test.

1700
03:59:43,060 --> 03:59:46,380
We have an automated test that verify something.

1701
03:59:49,860 --> 03:59:52,820
And here all the checks are passing,

1702
03:59:52,820 --> 03:59:55,640
which means that this pull request mechanism

1703
03:59:55,640 --> 03:59:58,660
even allows me to run automations like testing

1704
03:59:58,660 --> 04:00:04,660
And make sure that the functionality of this recipe book is preserved.

1705
04:00:04,660 --> 04:00:13,660
Yeah, this is a wonderful kebab recipe that I will now merge, and then it's part of the recipe book. Thanks so much.

1706
04:00:13,660 --> 04:00:17,660
Let's merge, and I will also say thank you.

1707
04:00:17,660 --> 04:00:26,420
Okay, cool. So now here's someone that's completely unrelated to us, has made a proposal, nothing

1708
04:00:26,420 --> 04:00:33,700
has been changed until we reviewed it and accepted it, and now it's part of our stuff.

1709
04:00:33,700 --> 04:00:39,780
And I guess this is basically how all the open source kind of software works. So it's

1710
04:00:39,780 --> 04:00:50,100
there, people can contribute, but the managers, owners, whatever, review and accept it.

1711
04:00:50,100 --> 04:01:03,860
Just looking at questions. So the next thing we want to do, but I'm now wondering whether

1712
04:01:03,860 --> 04:01:10,460
we will do it before the break after the break is that I want to actually create a conflict

1713
04:01:10,460 --> 04:01:15,060
some of you might have seen conflicts I will create it and we will also resolve it and

1714
04:01:15,060 --> 04:01:20,820
we will discuss what this yeah what it is and what is good about it maybe to keep it

1715
04:01:20,820 --> 04:01:30,740
all together we could go over some questions from the notes and then make the conflict

1716
04:01:30,740 --> 04:01:32,980
and resolve after the break.

1717
04:01:32,980 --> 04:01:33,980
Sounds good.

1718
04:01:33,980 --> 04:01:34,980
Yeah.

1719
04:01:34,980 --> 04:01:35,980
Okay, let's see.

1720
04:01:35,980 --> 04:01:43,580
Which question should we lift up here?

1721
04:01:43,580 --> 04:01:48,780
There's two, number 55 and 56, about safely deleting a branch.

1722
04:01:48,780 --> 04:01:54,860
So does deleting the branch lose any information?

1723
04:01:54,860 --> 04:02:01,900
No, it's it's after merging a pull request. It's I would say it's always safe to delete

1724
04:02:01,900 --> 04:02:06,460
it. It's not a problem. If you forget to delete it, it will be just there. It's it doesn't

1725
04:02:06,460 --> 04:02:16,100
take much space. Yeah. So sometimes I forget to delete them. And then if I go back into

1726
04:02:16,100 --> 04:02:27,580
this repository what is this how can I find all the branches it because I'm

1727
04:02:27,580 --> 04:02:33,340
zoomed out here so then sometimes I go into this branches overview which is

1728
04:02:33,340 --> 04:02:42,540
next to the name of the branch and it is overview it's you can then I can see

1729
04:02:42,540 --> 04:02:49,220
which branches are active, so for instance this branch is 28 commits behind.

1730
04:02:49,220 --> 04:02:51,780
You will also see which branches are merged.

1731
04:02:51,780 --> 04:02:58,560
This one is open merge request and if I would merge it, it would show a different symbol

1732
04:02:58,560 --> 04:03:02,380
and then I can also tidy up here.

1733
04:03:02,380 --> 04:03:07,540
So the only bad thing can happen if you forget is that you have lots of branches here, but

1734
04:03:07,540 --> 04:03:12,220
it doesn't take any like space and it's always safe to delete it because it doesn't remove

1735
04:03:12,220 --> 04:03:15,820
commits, it only removed this label

1736
04:03:15,820 --> 04:03:18,500
that we don't need anymore.

1737
04:03:18,500 --> 04:03:20,300
Yeah.

1738
04:03:20,300 --> 04:03:23,620
There's also several questions about if you

1739
04:03:23,620 --> 04:03:25,780
have several different changes and you

1740
04:03:25,780 --> 04:03:31,220
want to make separate pull requests out of them.

1741
04:03:31,220 --> 04:03:33,660
And I think this is sort of tied up or implicit

1742
04:03:33,660 --> 04:03:37,260
if the changes are on the same branch.

1743
04:03:37,260 --> 04:03:40,180
That's an excellent question.

1744
04:03:40,180 --> 04:03:47,300
And first off, if they are on the same branch, am I correct that you, it's either you merge

1745
04:03:47,300 --> 04:03:53,940
the whole branch or none of the branch, like the branch is the fundamental unit of work?

1746
04:03:54,900 --> 04:03:55,140
Okay.

1747
04:03:56,500 --> 04:04:00,100
So pull requests are from branch to branch.

1748
04:04:00,100 --> 04:04:12,000
So all the commits from the source branch will get integrated into the target branch.

1749
04:04:12,000 --> 04:04:21,220
And for us, it means that to organize our work, we will try to not put unrelated things

1750
04:04:21,220 --> 04:04:25,120
onto the same branch.

1751
04:04:25,120 --> 04:04:29,560
So what I like to do is that if I try to do something new, I create a new branch.

1752
04:04:29,560 --> 04:04:34,520
And sometimes I get confused and sometimes things get messy.

1753
04:04:34,520 --> 04:04:37,960
Also if you are completely new to git and github, I wouldn't overthink it too much.

1754
04:04:37,960 --> 04:04:42,520
I think it's better to create lots of commits.

1755
04:04:42,520 --> 04:04:46,440
And at the beginning, maybe okay, there will be some unrelated changes in a pull request

1756
04:04:46,440 --> 04:04:50,120
and maybe there will be some unrelated changes on a branch.

1757
04:04:50,120 --> 04:04:56,780
But later when you get more comfortable, we recommend create new branch for every new thing.

1758
04:04:56,780 --> 04:04:59,500
don't put unrelated things into the same branch,

1759
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:02,660
don't put unrelated things into the same commit.

1760
04:05:02,660 --> 04:05:04,660
And this will also make the pull request review easier

1761
04:05:04,660 --> 04:05:05,500
for the other person,

1762
04:05:05,500 --> 04:05:07,500
because then they only have to focus on one thing

1763
04:05:07,500 --> 04:05:10,540
and not these like two completely unrelated things.

1764
04:05:10,540 --> 04:05:14,260
It might also be that if I review a pull request,

1765
04:05:14,260 --> 04:05:15,940
maybe I understand,

1766
04:05:15,940 --> 04:05:17,700
I have a good understanding about the one thing,

1767
04:05:17,700 --> 04:05:20,420
but I have no knowledge about the other thing,

1768
04:05:20,420 --> 04:05:21,820
and then I cannot review it.

1769
04:05:22,940 --> 04:05:25,460
And instead, if it was two pull requests,

1770
04:05:25,460 --> 04:05:26,540
we could give the one to me

1771
04:05:26,540 --> 04:05:34,300
the other one to the other person who knows about this other thing yeah okay do

1772
04:05:34,300 --> 04:05:39,900
we still have time for a few more questions yes we have three more minutes

1773
04:05:39,900 --> 04:05:50,540
okay I had a good one here uh where was it

1774
04:05:50,540 --> 04:05:54,660
Maybe the last one, R60.

1775
04:05:54,660 --> 04:05:59,540
Yeah, that's good, yeah, go for it.

1776
04:05:59,540 --> 04:06:05,820
So the question is, multiple people, they work on the same file, and they make commits,

1777
04:06:05,820 --> 04:06:11,580
and they merge into the same branch.

1778
04:06:11,580 --> 04:06:15,640
We can imagine things will get messy, what is the best practice to solve the issue?

1779
04:06:15,640 --> 04:06:22,980
So if the multiple people are editing the same file in different places, it's not a

1780
04:06:22,980 --> 04:06:26,800
problem, Git will figure it out.

1781
04:06:26,800 --> 04:06:31,220
So for instance, if we have a recipe and somebody is working on the ingredients and somebody

1782
04:06:31,220 --> 04:06:38,820
else is changing the instructions, it's not a problem, Git will know that these are different

1783
04:06:38,820 --> 04:06:43,880
changes and it will merge them automatically.

1784
04:06:43,880 --> 04:06:48,200
The conflicts that we will see is when we modify the same portion of the file in two

1785
04:06:48,200 --> 04:06:51,360
different ways, and we will do that after the break.

1786
04:06:51,360 --> 04:06:57,680
But the best practice to solve the issue is if you notice in your project that lots of

1787
04:06:57,680 --> 04:07:01,840
people are working on the same file, I think it's good if they at least know about it.

1788
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:06,720
So hopefully all the three different people who work on the same file at least know that

1789
04:07:06,720 --> 04:07:09,000
other two people are doing something.

1790
04:07:09,000 --> 04:07:14,680
So sometimes in addition to just creating branches and commits, I notify my colleagues

1791
04:07:14,680 --> 04:07:19,600
on the chat and tell them, hey, everybody, in the next two weeks, I will be in this file

1792
04:07:19,600 --> 04:07:22,640
and you are there too, just that you know.

1793
04:07:22,640 --> 04:07:27,440
Or I open up a draft pull request.

1794
04:07:27,440 --> 04:07:30,800
And it's not finished, but at least my colleagues see that, aha, someone is doing something

1795
04:07:30,800 --> 04:07:31,800
in that file.

1796
04:07:31,800 --> 04:07:35,440
So then maybe they will, we better coordinate a little bit.

1797
04:07:35,440 --> 04:07:41,920
it's like you keep updating that file or that pull request constantly over time so people track

1798
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:47,760
yeah yeah and i think we'll talk more about this later like yeah more tomorrow so tomorrow we talk

1799
04:07:47,760 --> 04:07:54,880
about how does code review really work and sorry on thursday and really practice this like what

1800
04:07:54,880 --> 04:08:00,240
are what are best practices to to collaborate within your own group or what are best practices

1801
04:08:00,240 --> 04:08:05,920
to suggest changes to somebody else's project and avoid any surprises.

1802
04:08:05,920 --> 04:08:12,640
Yeah. Okay. If there's time, there's a good one. I merged a branch. No.

1803
04:08:14,640 --> 04:08:15,520
Which one is it?

1804
04:08:15,520 --> 04:08:21,040
49. So I thought this was about updating pull requests, but so it goes, I merged a branch,

1805
04:08:21,040 --> 04:08:27,280
but then after the merge, I made some changes to the branch and I did a commit and push to the

1806
04:08:27,280 --> 04:08:34,160
branch. So, okay, so the branch was merged and then you keep working on it. Should I...

1807
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:42,480
Maybe let's talk about the general picture here. So, if you make a branch and you make

1808
04:08:42,480 --> 04:08:51,280
a pull request out of the branch and you update that branch, then the pull request

1809
04:08:51,280 --> 04:08:58,640
gets updated instantly. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. Until it's merged. Until it's merged.

1810
04:08:58,640 --> 04:09:04,240
Once it's merged, I consider the branch. It's done for me. I can delete it or not,

1811
04:09:04,240 --> 04:09:10,240
but I don't touch it again. For anything new, create a new branch. Yeah. But if you do keep

1812
04:09:10,240 --> 04:09:17,760
updating the branch after it's merged, it becomes, well, then this is not automatically merged,

1813
04:09:17,760 --> 04:09:19,760
but you can make a new pull request.

1814
04:09:19,760 --> 04:09:21,760
Correct.

1815
04:09:21,760 --> 04:09:23,760
Yeah. Okay.

1816
04:09:23,760 --> 04:09:25,760
Should we go for a break?

1817
04:09:25,760 --> 04:09:27,760
Yeah, let's do that.

1818
04:09:27,760 --> 04:09:29,760
And then after that, create some conflicts.

1819
04:09:29,760 --> 04:09:31,760
And do some conflict resolution, but in a very nice way.

1820
04:09:31,760 --> 04:09:33,760
Sounds good. Okay.

1821
04:09:33,760 --> 04:09:35,760
We'll be back six minutes after the hour.

1822
04:09:35,760 --> 04:09:37,760
Yeah. Let's see.

1823
04:09:39,760 --> 04:09:41,760
See you then.

1824
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:43,760
Bye.

1825
04:09:43,760 --> 04:09:45,760
Bye.

1826
04:09:47,760 --> 04:09:49,820
you

1827
04:10:17,760 --> 04:10:19,820
you

1828
04:10:47,760 --> 04:10:49,820
you

1829
04:11:17,760 --> 04:11:19,820
you

1830
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:49,820
you

1831
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:19,820
you

1832
04:12:47,760 --> 04:12:49,820
you

1833
04:13:17,760 --> 04:13:19,820
you

1834
04:13:47,760 --> 04:13:49,820
you

1835
04:14:17,760 --> 04:14:19,820
you

1836
04:14:47,760 --> 04:14:49,820
you

1837
04:15:17,760 --> 04:15:19,820
you

1838
04:15:47,760 --> 04:15:49,820
you

1839
04:16:17,760 --> 04:16:19,820
you

1840
04:16:47,760 --> 04:16:49,820
you

1841
04:17:17,760 --> 04:17:19,820
you

1842
04:17:47,760 --> 04:17:49,820
you

1843
04:18:17,760 --> 04:18:19,820
you

1844
04:18:47,760 --> 04:18:49,820
you

1845
04:19:17,760 --> 04:19:37,760
Yeah, welcome back our remaining 25 minutes.

1846
04:19:37,760 --> 04:19:40,360
And we will talk about conflict resolution.

1847
04:19:40,360 --> 04:19:41,680
Yeah.

1848
04:19:41,680 --> 04:19:50,960
So what's a conflict?

1849
04:19:50,960 --> 04:19:55,160
So we have some text about it and explained in a sentence or two, but we really want to

1850
04:19:55,160 --> 04:20:05,920
also demonstrate it is it's the same portion of the same file is modified on two different

1851
04:20:05,920 --> 04:20:12,160
branches in two different ways and later we try to recombine these branches and this can

1852
04:20:12,160 --> 04:20:20,880
either happen that I do two different modifications myself and later try to merge them or it could

1853
04:20:20,880 --> 04:20:27,680
be more typical is two different people modify the same portion of the file in two different

1854
04:20:27,680 --> 04:20:32,840
ways and as soon as they try to merge changes for instance as part of a pull request they

1855
04:20:32,840 --> 04:20:38,440
notice that there is a conflict. And you have maybe already seen it and this will be only

1856
04:20:38,440 --> 04:20:40,080
a demonstration.

1857
04:20:40,080 --> 04:20:49,600
So this is the common case where the same things get modified twice, and in order to

1858
04:20:49,600 --> 04:20:55,120
combine them you have to actually decide, like a human has to be there and decide which

1859
04:20:55,120 --> 04:20:58,000
one to take.

1860
04:20:58,000 --> 04:21:06,760
And we paste the link here, so right now, for everybody, you can like lean back, watch,

1861
04:21:06,760 --> 04:21:10,080
and ask questions on the notes here.

1862
04:21:10,080 --> 04:21:13,600
And then later, if you want to test it out yourself, you can, but now this will be just

1863
04:21:13,600 --> 04:21:14,600
demonstration.

1864
04:21:14,600 --> 04:21:15,600
Yeah.

1865
04:21:15,600 --> 04:21:19,040
And I presume Git has good tools to manage this.

1866
04:21:19,040 --> 04:21:20,040
Yeah.

1867
04:21:20,040 --> 04:21:23,440
So you can solve this locally, you can solve it in GitLab, you can solve it in GitHub.

1868
04:21:23,440 --> 04:21:27,360
What we will show here is, I will create the conflict on GitHub, we will also solve it

1869
04:21:27,360 --> 04:21:36,360
on GitHub. Okay, I'll do that back in my repository in my recipe book.

1870
04:21:36,360 --> 04:21:46,800
Yeah, and I will make now two changes one on main and the other change on this branch.

1871
04:21:46,800 --> 04:21:54,120
I think I need to create a new branch for it. So let me first create a branch. I will create

1872
04:21:54,120 --> 04:22:01,360
a branch and I want to I will call it less cilantro because I'm not so much a

1873
04:22:01,360 --> 04:22:04,680
fan so I will take a guacamole recipe and remove a little bit of cilantro from

1874
04:22:04,680 --> 04:22:13,800
the recipe okay so new branch and I am on this less cilantro branch I will now

1875
04:22:13,800 --> 04:22:21,400
navigate to the guacamole recipe and make a change there yeah guacamole edit

1876
04:22:21,400 --> 04:22:35,160
pen and I would like less 0.5 tablespoons.

1877
04:22:35,160 --> 04:22:36,160
Makes sense.

1878
04:22:36,160 --> 04:22:37,160
Okay.

1879
04:22:37,160 --> 04:22:39,440
And then the typical commit message.

1880
04:22:39,440 --> 04:22:41,480
This is not a good message.

1881
04:22:41,480 --> 04:22:52,440
I'll have much better is reduce amount of by half and even better is why I did it because

1882
04:22:53,240 --> 04:22:58,600
with git you can see who changed and what they changed but sometimes it's hard to see why I did

1883
04:22:58,600 --> 04:23:06,280
it because well because I don't like it I don't like that ingredient so much yeah okay and then

1884
04:23:06,280 --> 04:23:10,800
And then I guess when someone's looking at it later and resolving, they can understand

1885
04:23:10,800 --> 04:23:11,800
why.

1886
04:23:11,800 --> 04:23:14,280
Like, was there something wrong, or is this a preference thing?

1887
04:23:14,280 --> 04:23:15,280
Yeah.

1888
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:16,280
Okay.

1889
04:23:16,280 --> 04:23:17,280
Good.

1890
04:23:17,280 --> 04:23:18,280
We have that commit.

1891
04:23:18,280 --> 04:23:19,280
Yeah.

1892
04:23:19,280 --> 04:23:20,920
No pull request yet.

1893
04:23:20,920 --> 04:23:25,120
I will now navigate back to main.

1894
04:23:25,120 --> 04:23:28,160
And on the main branch, I will modify the same file.

1895
04:23:28,160 --> 04:23:31,120
Now I'm same file.

1896
04:23:31,120 --> 04:23:36,800
You notice that on the main branch, it still says one tablespoon.

1897
04:23:36,800 --> 04:23:50,960
And on the main branch, this could be now somebody else really likes this ingredient.

1898
04:23:50,960 --> 04:23:54,440
Here we go from one to two.

1899
04:23:54,440 --> 04:23:57,600
So I created two commits.

1900
04:23:57,600 --> 04:24:05,080
We are not not merged yet and I could browse them on the on the graph but let me know

1901
04:24:05,080 --> 04:24:13,820
Now we anticipate that there will be a conflict I will create a pull request

1902
04:24:13,820 --> 04:24:19,520
And again I want it within my own repository here

1903
04:24:19,520 --> 04:24:23,500
From less cilantro to main and already here Okay

1904
04:24:23,500 --> 04:24:25,540
we cannot automatically merge.

1905
04:24:25,540 --> 04:24:29,420
But we don't worry.

1906
04:24:29,420 --> 04:24:31,860
Let me open it anyway.

1907
04:24:31,860 --> 04:24:33,180
It will not be a draft one.

1908
04:24:37,300 --> 04:24:38,140
I will open it.

1909
04:24:38,140 --> 04:24:39,100
Let's see what happens.

1910
04:24:44,380 --> 04:24:45,340
It has conflicts.

1911
04:24:45,340 --> 04:24:47,700
OK, this looks different.

1912
04:24:47,700 --> 04:24:51,180
And I think in the notes, we saw some people with questions

1913
04:24:51,180 --> 04:24:55,180
where they saw a message like this.

1914
04:24:55,180 --> 04:24:58,180
But I guess this is actually good here.

1915
04:24:58,180 --> 04:25:03,180
If two people do the same thing different ways,

1916
04:25:03,180 --> 04:25:07,180
the worst possible case is that you pick one of them randomly

1917
04:25:07,180 --> 04:25:11,180
and you don't realize it happened.

1918
04:25:11,180 --> 04:25:15,180
This is presumably going to let us understand what happened

1919
04:25:15,180 --> 04:25:19,180
and solve it.

1920
04:25:19,180 --> 04:25:20,660
How do we do that?

1921
04:25:20,660 --> 04:25:24,620
So again, I also really emphasize what you that it's a good thing.

1922
04:25:24,620 --> 04:25:26,060
This is a really good thing.

1923
04:25:26,060 --> 04:25:30,940
It will prevent us from accidentally remove each other's work.

1924
04:25:30,940 --> 04:25:35,220
It even it didn't matter whether which change was their first.

1925
04:25:35,220 --> 04:25:38,300
So earlier today, we talked a little bit, there were some questions about chronology

1926
04:25:38,300 --> 04:25:40,420
of commits.

1927
04:25:40,420 --> 04:25:45,660
It doesn't matter whether the one commit was at nine o'clock and the other one at 11 o'clock.

1928
04:25:45,660 --> 04:25:48,060
That doesn't matter to the conflict.

1929
04:25:48,060 --> 04:25:53,740
It happened on two different branches, it asks me now to intervene, and that's good,

1930
04:25:53,740 --> 04:25:57,360
because it cannot decide for me.

1931
04:25:57,360 --> 04:26:00,540
And now there are many ways to resolve it, but we will now do the graphical way here

1932
04:26:00,540 --> 04:26:03,340
directly on the web, resolve conflicts.

1933
04:26:03,340 --> 04:26:09,900
Which is often what I'll do for relatively simple, easy to understand things like this.

1934
04:26:09,900 --> 04:26:14,560
So this sure looks pretty clear.

1935
04:26:14,560 --> 04:26:16,600
If people try it locally, it will look similar.

1936
04:26:16,600 --> 04:26:21,760
So it adds these markers here, which

1937
04:26:21,760 --> 04:26:27,560
mark that this change happened on this branch,

1938
04:26:27,560 --> 04:26:30,560
and this modification happened on the main branch.

1939
04:26:30,560 --> 04:26:33,560
And now it asks me to, well, please decide.

1940
04:26:33,560 --> 04:26:34,060
Yes.

1941
04:26:37,040 --> 04:26:38,000
OK.

1942
04:26:38,000 --> 04:26:41,600
And what are we going to pick?

1943
04:26:41,600 --> 04:26:42,200
I don't know.

1944
04:26:42,200 --> 04:26:52,460
Yeah, what, or could the recipe say cilantro to taste between half and two tablespoons?

1945
04:26:52,460 --> 04:26:58,140
It could, so I don't actually have to pick one of the two, I can also pick a compromise.

1946
04:26:58,140 --> 04:27:04,500
I could say zero to two to taste.

1947
04:27:04,500 --> 04:27:09,560
But what I have to do is I have to remove these extra markers.

1948
04:27:09,560 --> 04:27:14,320
So this stuff is just for me, but I should remove it before I mark it as resolved.

1949
04:27:14,320 --> 04:27:15,320
It even doesn't let me.

1950
04:27:15,320 --> 04:27:20,320
It tells me now that remove all conflict markers to resolve this file, and what it means is

1951
04:27:20,320 --> 04:27:24,560
remove this, and remove all this extra stuff.

1952
04:27:24,560 --> 04:27:25,560
Okay.

1953
04:27:25,560 --> 04:27:27,600
And now I can mark it as resolved.

1954
04:27:27,600 --> 04:27:30,340
And the file looks like it should look now.

1955
04:27:30,340 --> 04:27:33,400
So we can tell when it's done.

1956
04:27:33,400 --> 04:27:34,680
There's no weird stuff there.

1957
04:27:34,680 --> 04:27:35,680
Okay.

1958
04:27:35,680 --> 04:27:39,680
And now the resolution will be an additional commit.

1959
04:27:39,680 --> 04:27:45,680
I see.

1960
04:27:45,680 --> 04:27:49,680
Yeah. So again, it's the idea of making a commit.

1961
04:27:49,680 --> 04:27:53,680
Somehow. Okay. Yeah. And now

1962
04:27:53,680 --> 04:27:57,680
it's happy. There is no conflict now, because this commit

1963
04:27:57,680 --> 04:28:01,680
contained the resolution.

1964
04:28:01,680 --> 04:28:05,680
And now we can merge.

1965
04:28:05,680 --> 04:28:09,680
Okay.

1966
04:28:09,680 --> 04:28:13,680
Yeah, good. I mean, that wasn't that hard. I mean, it showed

1967
04:28:13,680 --> 04:28:17,680
us what the problem was. We could look at it. So when would a

1968
04:28:17,680 --> 04:28:21,680
conflict resolution be very difficult?

1969
04:28:21,680 --> 04:28:25,680
I guess if... So here two people

1970
04:28:25,680 --> 04:28:29,680
are doing the same things, but it's one line. But let's say

1971
04:28:29,680 --> 04:28:37,680
two people both rewrite the whole recipe from scratch, then you'll basically see two copies

1972
04:28:37,680 --> 04:28:42,000
of the recipe there, and have to...

1973
04:28:42,000 --> 04:28:51,680
Here it was easy because it was not too many changes, and not in too many places. So sometimes

1974
04:28:51,680 --> 04:28:56,560
conflicts can be all over the place. It can also be more complicated if this is a change

1975
04:28:56,560 --> 04:29:00,480
to where I simply don't know the answer. I mean git is asking me should I take the one or the other

1976
04:29:00,480 --> 04:29:05,040
but what if I just simply don't know. Sometimes I need to ask my colleague who maybe knows more

1977
04:29:05,040 --> 04:29:09,360
about that code. But then we can have a conversation on the pull request thread

1978
04:29:10,240 --> 04:29:13,440
and figure out which version is the one that we should keep.

1979
04:29:15,120 --> 04:29:18,960
But it's good that we get asked so no work is deleted by accident.

1980
04:29:18,960 --> 04:29:28,480
Okay, now we have less than 15 minutes left, we can, we still have time for questions.

1981
04:29:28,480 --> 04:29:31,120
And did you merge the pull request already?

1982
04:29:31,120 --> 04:29:32,120
I didn't yet.

1983
04:29:32,120 --> 04:29:33,120
Okay.

1984
04:29:33,120 --> 04:29:34,120
Should I?

1985
04:29:34,120 --> 04:29:35,120
Yeah.

1986
04:29:35,120 --> 04:29:36,120
Oh.

1987
04:29:36,120 --> 04:29:37,120
Should you?

1988
04:29:37,120 --> 04:29:38,120
I guess.

1989
04:29:38,120 --> 04:29:39,120
Why not?

1990
04:29:39,120 --> 04:29:40,120
Yeah.

1991
04:29:40,120 --> 04:29:43,120
It's, it's on my, my copy.

1992
04:29:43,120 --> 04:29:44,120
Yeah.

1993
04:29:45,000 --> 04:29:47,080
Save to delete, yes it is. Delete branch.

1994
04:29:48,920 --> 04:29:49,420
Okay.

1995
04:29:50,920 --> 04:29:55,640
So at this stage, our ambition was that we understand what a conflict is.

1996
04:29:57,000 --> 04:30:01,720
How to resolve a conflict, you can try it out on your own. It will anyway appear sooner or later.

1997
04:30:02,760 --> 04:30:06,520
It might also appear on Thursday when we collaborate, and then we will return to it.

1998
04:30:07,240 --> 04:30:12,200
Yeah. And on Thursday, did we talk about how to reduce conflicts?

1999
04:30:12,200 --> 04:30:19,720
yes or make them less likely that's the yeah which is really nothing special to

2000
04:30:19,720 --> 04:30:28,160
get but it's ways people work together yeah on things very useful lesson and so

2001
04:30:28,160 --> 04:30:31,240
now with on one screen I see your questions coming in and we still have

2002
04:30:31,240 --> 04:30:38,200
time for them I also wanted to zoom out here a little bit and again tell you

2003
04:30:38,200 --> 04:30:39,160
what was the big picture?

2004
04:30:39,160 --> 04:30:44,160
So today, the big picture was seeing a Git repository

2005
04:30:44,920 --> 04:30:46,520
and seeing commits.

2006
04:30:46,520 --> 04:30:49,440
We started in the web, we created a copy,

2007
04:30:49,440 --> 04:30:51,360
we created commits, we created branches,

2008
04:30:51,360 --> 04:30:53,200
and we were able to merge them.

2009
04:30:54,880 --> 04:30:59,300
Tomorrow, we will move from the web,

2010
04:30:59,300 --> 04:31:01,900
we will learn how to copy a repository

2011
04:31:01,900 --> 04:31:03,320
from the web to a laptop,

2012
04:31:04,360 --> 04:31:06,460
but also we will learn how to go the other way.

2013
04:31:06,460 --> 04:31:10,200
if you have a project, if you have some code script files,

2014
04:31:11,100 --> 04:31:13,760
how to turn it into a Git repository

2015
04:31:13,760 --> 04:31:17,140
and share it on the web.

2016
04:31:18,500 --> 04:31:21,460
And we will learn a bit more really useful tools

2017
04:31:21,460 --> 04:31:25,500
on how to inspect the history of a project

2018
04:31:25,500 --> 04:31:27,340
because very often we don't start from zero

2019
04:31:27,340 --> 04:31:29,060
but we join an existing project

2020
04:31:29,060 --> 04:31:30,460
and how to navigate in that.

2021
04:31:32,700 --> 04:31:35,980
And we will then close tomorrow by discussing

2022
04:31:35,980 --> 04:31:44,100
like where to start and how to find a good balance of not trying to make things too perfect

2023
04:31:44,100 --> 04:31:51,700
first day will be all about collaboration yeah

2024
04:31:51,700 --> 04:31:58,540
i will open up questions here we should also paste somewhere of feedback form because at

2025
04:31:58,540 --> 04:32:03,140
the end of every day we want to ask you about yeah one thing that you liked and one thing

2026
04:32:03,140 --> 04:32:06,220
that we should improve.

2027
04:32:06,220 --> 04:32:08,180
And if we can improve it already until tomorrow,

2028
04:32:08,180 --> 04:32:09,020
we will try to.

2029
04:32:11,820 --> 04:32:14,180
Let me browse here through the questions.

2030
04:32:14,180 --> 04:32:16,740
Let's see, I'm looking for the feedback.

2031
04:32:19,700 --> 04:32:21,100
Yeah, question 62.

2032
04:32:23,500 --> 04:32:24,340
That's a good question,

2033
04:32:24,340 --> 04:32:26,260
and we will return to it on Thursday,

2034
04:32:26,260 --> 04:32:27,820
but already as a little preview,

2035
04:32:27,820 --> 04:32:32,340
is that my fork is now

2036
04:32:33,140 --> 04:32:44,020
It has a couple of commits that nobody else has, but also it's lacking a couple of commits.

2037
04:32:44,020 --> 04:32:48,740
And you can then, on Thursday, we will then learn how you can then synchronize, update

2038
04:32:48,740 --> 04:32:57,700
your fork so that I get also the nice kebab recipe and other recipes that might have been

2039
04:32:57,700 --> 04:33:00,180
submitted to the upstream repository.

2040
04:33:00,180 --> 04:33:06,340
So more about that on Thursday, but it's a great question.

2041
04:33:06,340 --> 04:33:11,700
Question 63, how about using branches no matter how small the changes are and no matter the

2042
04:33:11,700 --> 04:33:15,100
size of the team, one person or several?

2043
04:33:15,100 --> 04:33:17,220
Really great question.

2044
04:33:17,220 --> 04:33:24,300
So if I'm on my own and I know that I want to have that change, I often just commit directly

2045
04:33:24,300 --> 04:33:25,300
on main.

2046
04:33:25,300 --> 04:33:31,540
I typically start using branches when I'm not so sure about whether this will work out

2047
04:33:31,540 --> 04:33:38,460
or I want to keep it separate because it's changing lots of things and I want to not

2048
04:33:38,460 --> 04:33:43,500
keep it in the main main code yet or if I'm more than one person.

2049
04:33:43,500 --> 04:33:47,900
If we are more than one person then I typically start using branches and start using code

2050
04:33:47,900 --> 04:33:48,900
review.

2051
04:33:48,900 --> 04:33:49,900
Yeah.

2052
04:33:49,900 --> 04:33:59,820
Yeah, can I retract the merge request? Yes, you can close it. So if you close it, then

2053
04:33:59,820 --> 04:34:04,260
that means retracting. Often it's nice to write down why you closed it. So sometimes

2054
04:34:04,260 --> 04:34:08,180
I see people just closing it and I'm not sure why was it closed. So you can add a sentence

2055
04:34:08,180 --> 04:34:12,320
that Oh, yeah, I found out that this is maybe not the best way of doing it. I need to think

2056
04:34:12,320 --> 04:34:18,000
about it more. I close it, I might reopen it later. And you can so you can also later

2057
04:34:18,000 --> 04:34:20,400
reopen a pull request which has been closed.

2058
04:34:25,400 --> 04:34:25,900
Yeah.

2059
04:34:26,800 --> 04:34:30,500
And here a little bit further down on the screen is the

2060
04:34:30,500 --> 04:34:31,300
feedback form.

2061
04:34:33,400 --> 04:34:35,700
Let us know about the speed.

2062
04:34:36,600 --> 04:34:37,400
Was it the right speed?

2063
04:34:37,400 --> 04:34:38,600
Was it too fast, too slow?

2064
04:34:38,700 --> 04:34:41,800
Also about the level and we know that especially on day

2065
04:34:41,800 --> 04:34:45,700
one, it's difficult to find the balance of the right level.

2066
04:34:45,700 --> 04:34:51,460
Over the next days, things will calibrate a little bit better.

2067
04:34:51,460 --> 04:34:57,660
But really, our goal is to keep everybody engaged.

2068
04:34:57,660 --> 04:35:02,540
Let us know how the exercises went, and tell us one thing that was really good, and one

2069
04:35:02,540 --> 04:35:05,220
thing that was maybe not so good.

2070
04:35:05,220 --> 04:35:10,020
And we really want to hear also the things to improve.

2071
04:35:10,020 --> 04:35:16,700
Yeah, I'm filling in answers here.

2072
04:35:16,700 --> 04:35:23,900
What about discussions and issues versus discussion and pull requests?

2073
04:35:23,900 --> 04:35:35,920
Yeah, that's a good question.

2074
04:35:35,920 --> 04:35:47,860
So if this is something bigger, a bigger change, or I'm not sure whether the repository wants

2075
04:35:47,860 --> 04:35:53,880
my change at all, I often start with an issue and first ask around like, is this a good

2076
04:35:53,880 --> 04:36:02,080
idea do you want this what is the right place which file so sometimes it starts

2077
04:36:02,080 --> 04:36:07,240
in issue but there can be also pull requests and then in a pull request I

2078
04:36:07,240 --> 04:36:12,360
can refer to the issue but there can also be pull requests which did not

2079
04:36:12,360 --> 04:36:16,680
start in an issue and it just appears there and then then maybe we continue

2080
04:36:16,680 --> 04:36:19,280
the discussion in a pull request the discussion in a pull request is maybe

2081
04:36:19,280 --> 04:36:27,080
more about okay how do I improve this thing and in the issue it's more about what is a

2082
04:36:27,080 --> 04:36:34,920
good starting point is this the right approach is this something we want at all

2083
04:36:34,920 --> 04:36:40,940
and sometimes discussion up here on both places and that's okay too and then but both can cross

2084
04:36:40,940 --> 04:36:45,020
reference each other so the issue can then refer to the pull request the pull request

2085
04:36:45,020 --> 04:36:46,020
can refer to the issue.

2086
04:36:54,020 --> 04:36:56,740
Under feedback for something to improve for next time,

2087
04:36:56,740 --> 04:37:00,740
there's this concept of Git push that wasn't introduced.

2088
04:37:00,740 --> 04:37:03,020
And I think that's partly our thing.

2089
04:37:03,020 --> 04:37:10,540
So we will introduce it properly tomorrow, I believe.

2090
04:37:10,540 --> 04:37:13,260
So today, we only introduced enough

2091
04:37:13,260 --> 04:37:15,460
to go through the GitHub web interface.

2092
04:37:15,460 --> 04:37:17,940
And of course, people could do more.

2093
04:37:17,940 --> 04:37:20,820
There were instructions there.

2094
04:37:20,820 --> 04:37:25,820
But we, yeah, like it's sort of this like dependency thing.

2095
04:37:29,540 --> 04:37:32,700
But don't worry, we will get to it all.

2096
04:37:32,700 --> 04:37:36,180
Yeah, so some things are a little bit vague by design,

2097
04:37:36,180 --> 04:37:38,300
but they will get clarified.

2098
04:37:38,300 --> 04:37:39,660
It's like looking at a blurry picture

2099
04:37:39,660 --> 04:37:40,900
and it will get clearer tomorrow

2100
04:37:40,900 --> 04:37:42,340
and even clearer on Thursday.

2101
04:37:43,260 --> 04:37:50,460
and it's all a balance to to not overwhelm with too many details as on day one but yeah concepts

2102
04:37:50,460 --> 04:37:56,140
like what is really happening when we push what is happening when we pull we will do more of that

2103
04:37:56,140 --> 04:38:02,860
tomorrow and really we will get an understanding of it on thursday yeah feedback positive thing

2104
04:38:02,860 --> 04:38:06,940
cute cat very often we have this wanting to improve more more cat

2105
04:38:06,940 --> 04:38:18,900
it's usually there on days the cat doesn't come by anyway yeah yeah and

2106
04:38:18,900 --> 04:38:22,180
thanks also for the feedback about that maybe some examples need more detail

2107
04:38:22,180 --> 04:38:30,060
maybe more screenshots more detail for the command line oh one one cool thing

2108
04:38:30,060 --> 04:38:35,580
about this workshop is that by Thursday you will all be able to send pull

2109
04:38:35,580 --> 04:38:46,780
request to this repository and also maybe send us improvements for the lesson.

2110
04:38:46,780 --> 04:38:50,980
And an improvement can also be opening an issue and telling us about there.

2111
04:38:50,980 --> 04:38:54,100
But thanks a lot for telling us here.

2112
04:38:54,100 --> 04:38:57,820
So we look at this feedback and the thing that we can improve for tomorrow we will.

2113
04:38:57,820 --> 04:39:02,740
The things that we can improve until next workshop we will as well.

2114
04:39:02,740 --> 04:39:11,360
Under one of the things to improve for next time, it goes back to the question of using

2115
04:39:11,360 --> 04:39:13,400
Git for things like Word documents.

2116
04:39:13,400 --> 04:39:19,680
Also, by the way, can you please not select everything on the page?

2117
04:39:19,680 --> 04:39:24,480
Because there's a risk of it all getting deleted and it highlights it for everyone.

2118
04:39:24,480 --> 04:39:25,480
Yes.

2119
04:39:25,480 --> 04:39:26,480
Thanks.

2120
04:39:26,480 --> 04:39:28,560
So, Word document.

2121
04:39:28,560 --> 04:39:34,680
So let's say you have a file that's not a traditional code file or whatever.

2122
04:39:34,680 --> 04:39:40,740
So in that case, you don't edit it through the GitHub web interface.

2123
04:39:40,740 --> 04:39:46,740
So yes, you can upload it, you can download it, things like that.

2124
04:39:46,740 --> 04:39:52,440
If you're on your own computer, you can put it there, you can edit it with Word, and then

2125
04:39:52,440 --> 04:39:58,680
And you would basically tell Git, okay, now please update your memory of this file each

2126
04:39:58,680 --> 04:40:01,120
time you make a commit.

2127
04:40:01,120 --> 04:40:07,520
And things like comparing can't be done in the GitHub web interface.

2128
04:40:07,520 --> 04:40:10,120
It can't be done through the other editors.

2129
04:40:10,120 --> 04:40:16,000
Actually there are different extensions you can use for Git which let you compare different

2130
04:40:16,000 --> 04:40:21,640
types of files, but let's ignore those for now.

2131
04:40:21,640 --> 04:40:31,480
So what we'd say as far as this lesson is concerned, if it's not a text file, then basically

2132
04:40:31,480 --> 04:40:37,120
you modify it however you would normally, and then you tell Git, remember this new copy,

2133
04:40:37,120 --> 04:40:39,000
record the changes.

2134
04:40:39,000 --> 04:40:47,960
And that's the extent of what we'll talk about for now.

2135
04:40:47,960 --> 04:40:57,800
Yeah, really looking forward to tomorrow.

2136
04:40:57,800 --> 04:41:05,200
We will also then talk about how to ignore certain files, because maybe not all the files

2137
04:41:05,200 --> 04:41:06,200
should go into repository.

2138
04:41:06,200 --> 04:41:11,980
We left it out today, but we will return to it.

2139
04:41:11,980 --> 04:41:19,420
And really, my goal is that by tomorrow, everybody is able to share their work on places like

2140
04:41:19,420 --> 04:41:22,420
GitHub or GitLab.

2141
04:41:22,420 --> 04:41:23,420
Yeah.

2142
04:41:23,420 --> 04:41:24,620
Can you scroll down a little bit?

2143
04:41:24,620 --> 04:41:26,780
I'm writing news for day one.

2144
04:41:26,780 --> 04:41:27,780
Oh, thanks.

2145
04:41:27,780 --> 04:41:35,740
So tomorrow, we will do many of the same things but on our own computers.

2146
04:41:35,740 --> 04:41:37,180
Is that correct?

2147
04:41:37,180 --> 04:41:38,180
Yeah.

2148
04:41:38,180 --> 04:41:43,400
Being able to clone, so being able to copy a repository from the web to the laptop and

2149
04:41:43,400 --> 04:41:47,440
continue there, but also do the opposite.

2150
04:41:47,440 --> 04:41:53,720
Being able to share my work so that others can copy it and others can contribute it.

2151
04:41:53,720 --> 04:41:56,880
These are the goals for tomorrow.

2152
04:41:56,880 --> 04:42:00,640
Is there any special preparation to do?

2153
04:42:00,640 --> 04:42:14,640
Yes, there is, because tomorrow, since we will work locally, we tomorrow we will need

2154
04:42:14,640 --> 04:42:22,300
either something like VS code or the command line

2155
04:42:22,300 --> 04:42:24,340
to go through all the steps.

2156
04:42:24,340 --> 04:42:30,340
Now, if somebody doesn't have these and only wants to do everything on the web, I would

2157
04:42:30,340 --> 04:42:35,660
say that please still show up there is maybe a few steps that you can you then

2158
04:42:35,660 --> 04:42:40,860
cannot follow because they are about how to make a local commit yeah and you'll

2159
04:42:40,860 --> 04:42:47,140
learn what to prepare for in the future so yeah that's completely fine also yeah

2160
04:42:47,140 --> 04:42:52,500
okay so not much to prepare for tomorrow there will be something to prepare for

2161
04:42:52,500 --> 04:42:56,580
day three for Thursday which because then we want to collaborate and we will

2162
04:42:56,580 --> 04:43:04,180
make it possible to collaborate even if for individual participants. So then we

2163
04:43:04,180 --> 04:43:08,580
will the individual participants we will invite you into our exercise repository

2164
04:43:08,580 --> 04:43:13,820
and for this you will need to do a few quick clicks but we will send them we

2165
04:43:13,820 --> 04:43:20,820
will send a message about this.

2166
04:43:20,820 --> 04:43:32,500
Yeah, so as soon as this is done, if not already, the replay will be available on Twitch and

2167
04:43:32,500 --> 04:43:42,940
last there for 7 days, and probably by midnight Eastern European time, the videos will be

2168
04:43:42,940 --> 04:43:57,100
processed and on YouTube. So, yes, you can catch up with everything we did today.

2169
04:43:57,100 --> 04:44:03,300
And what an amazing time management we have. So it's half past the hour. Thanks so much

2170
04:44:03,300 --> 04:44:08,460
everybody who contributed and there were many people, not only those who we've seen here

2171
04:44:08,460 --> 04:44:14,540
video but also people in the background preparing things managing exercise teams answering questions

2172
04:44:14,540 --> 04:44:25,180
so thanks so much everybody and we will see you tomorrow yeah great okay so see you later then

2173
