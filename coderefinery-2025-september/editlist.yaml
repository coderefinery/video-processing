  title: 1.2 Git Intro (day 1)
  description: >
    Here, we go over the basics of git from first principles, using
    the GitHub web interface.  First, we talk about basic motivation
    about why version control.  Then, we use the GitHub web interface
    to understand the basics of history, branches, commits, and
    merges, conflict resolution (online), and how everything fits
    together.  This isn't how normal work would happen, but it's a
    much easier starting point.  Part 2 (on day 2) goes to local work
    using all the same concepts we learned today.

    Multi-user work and remotes is the next lesson, git-collaborative,
    on day 3.

    We continue where we left off from day 1.  We advance by working
    locally: first, cloning a repository and doing some of the same
    things we did yesterday (committing, branching, etc).  Then, we
    clone a sample repository and use it to practice more advanced
    history inspection.  Then, we show and practice taking a project
    that isn't controlled by git, using VSCode and doing all
    of the tracking, linking to the web repository (GitHub, GitLab,
    etc).  The day ends with lots of practical advice on various
    topics.

      Today, we expand from using git by yourself to using it in a
      team.  We use Github, centralized workflows, forking on Github,
      pull requests, code review, commenting on pull requests,
      practical advice on using Git and version control in real projects,
      contributing to other projects, and more.  This really puts the
      previous two days together and lets you know how things work in
      bigger projects.

#    If you can't get your code to do the same thing again, is it

#    work?  Reproducibilty is a big deal, but we don't always learn how
#    to do it.  In this lesson, we cover the basics, how to organize
#    projects, record computational steps with Snakemake or other
#    workflow managers, how to record environments with conda (and
#    containers a bit), and sharing code and data (FAIR).

#    We don't just program for ourselves: we are part of a community.
#    As scientists, we want to get citations, so how can our software
#    support this?  Our work is a constant balance between using the
#    work of others and hoping that others will use our work.  In this
#    lesson, we talk about the advantages and disadvantages of others
#    building on our work, and how to support that.
#

    In this lesson we discuss different solutions for implementing and

    how we would code documentation like to be. Then after a tour of
    available tools, we discuss how to write useful and accessible
    READMEs, and then we progress by demonstrating and practicing the
    Sphinx documentation generator and demonstrate how to deploy
    documentation to Github Pages.

    Topics and tools discussed: Markdown, reStructured text, README
    documentation, table of contents generation, Sphinx, Read the
    Docs, GitHub/GitLab pages.

#     reusability. The emphasis of this lesson is to demonstrate how to
#     use notebooks in combination with version control and how to share
#     reproducible notebooks via Binder.

#    started testing their software.
#
#    Tools covered include concepts of testing for science, unit
#    testing, pytest, continuous integration, and GitHub actions.  We
#    make demos in Python, but have examples in other languages and

#    In this live-coding demo session we take a Python script as

#    generates a plot. Together we then improve this code based on
#    suggestions from the audience to arrive at a more reusable code
#    with reusable components. We start in the Jupyter notebook, later
#    move to a Python script/module, introduce testing, and finally
#    introduce and motivate a command line interface to our code.
#
#    In this demonstration we use JupyterLab, Python, Pandas,
#    Matplotlib, pytest, and Click.  It is also a great demonstration
