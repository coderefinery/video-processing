1
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:13,101
Stream is online.

2
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,996
I have to send an email reminder.

3
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:58,714
All right, maybe I send already the email,

4
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,157
because you will start or maybe

5
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:01,379
I send it when you start

6
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,809
the jingle, which is in about one minute.

7
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:12,660
Yeah.

8
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,127
And I will be the first one screen sharing.

9
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,993
doing the intro, doing

10
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,996
the notes documentary cup, reminding

11
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:27,080
of the request for access.

12
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,844
And then I will introduce [name]

13
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:34,688
and [name], which reminds me that

14
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:36,150
I need to tell something about you.

15
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,071
What do you want me to

16
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,355
say about yourself, [name] and [name]?

17
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:43,018
Oh, I'll also turn my camera

18
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,199
on for the intro.

19
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,422
I don't mind.

20
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:47,903
I can also quickly...

21
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:50,514
We can also introduce ourselves.

22
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:53,997
I don't know what you prefer.

23
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:54,858
Otherwise, you could say that

24
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,600
we work in data performance computing.

25
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,682
Actually, first of all, we

26
00:06:58,682 --> 00:06:59,583
are a software engineering group

27
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,084
at UIT in Tromsø, Norway.

28
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:03,667
Well, the next Nordic RSC

29
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,649
conference will happen if you want

30
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,311
to use that as a platform to advertise.

31
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,572
Okay, that's good.

32
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:11,835
I'm starting the jingle now.

33
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,721
So you're both from the same...

34
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,127
Yeah.

35
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,243
We can also quickly introduce

36
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,246
ourselves at the beginning, if you prefer.

37
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,489
No, well, I mean, like you

38
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,892
said, it's a good reminder also to say

39
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,853
that you are from the

40
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,561
UIT, the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø.

41
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,462
You are part of the

42
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,944
research software engineering group.

43
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:53,810
specialist in high performance computing.

44
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,477
And it [name], you might

45
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,319
be the first engineer here who

46
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,064
does more RSC than HPC from the beginning.

47
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:08,466
That's good.

48
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:17,996
And you're not you will come down.

49
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,378
Sorry.

50
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,889
you will count down when we've

51
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:27,039
ah yeah yeah um very soon

52
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:36,865
10 seconds two five four three two one

53
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:41,668
Hello, hello, hello.

54
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,573
Let's first do a sound

55
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:49,061
check with the people on Zulip,

56
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,085
because in case you didn't know,

57
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,149
we have an amazing Zulip channel

58
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,874
with all the Code Refinery community.

59
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:56,595
So let's see.

60
00:08:56,595 --> 00:09:00,422
I can see...

61
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:10,636
Okay.

62
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:12,098
So we were actually, they

63
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,761
could already hear us before

64
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,983
we were live, which is good.

65
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,086
We didn't say anything.

66
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,207
All right.

67
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,490
So exciting day number three

68
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,332
of the Code Refinery

69
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,715
workshop, September, October, 2025.

70
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,418
As usual, I'm sharing

71
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:29,842
the workshop homepage, which is

72
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:32,065
the container of all the

73
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:35,269
links and useful information.

74
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:39,092
what else so today we are at day three

75
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:44,061
and we will I will soon do

76
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,644
a recap of day three but while

77
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,727
we are warming up for those

78
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:49,630
who were here yesterday you

79
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,394
might be familiar already with

80
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:54,840
this notes document there are

81
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,242
some icebreakers there

82
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,266
If you could ask for any

83
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,088
superpower, it can be a

84
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:03,051
computer related superpower, what

85
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:03,892
would you ask for?

86
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,054
So click on the pencil

87
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,777
and write your answer.

88
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:12,423
Today with us, we have [name] and [name].

89
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:13,724
I will introduce you properly

90
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:18,410
at the o'clock, but I could

91
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,753
ask you already [name], if you

92
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,996
could ask for any superpower, what

93
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,578
would you go for?

94
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:29,344
I should have had an answer.

95
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:30,225
I don't know.

96
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,187
Since we live in Tromsø,

97
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:32,048
not in Norway, we'll be

98
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,251
falling asleep whenever we want.

99
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,300
Not being affected by midnight sun.

100
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,760
It's true.

101
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:42,708
Well, soon you get whatever,

102
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,493
six months of night.

103
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:49,680
It's just one month.

104
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,473
Yeah.

105
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:52,995
So for those in the streaming,

106
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,318
both [name] and [name] are in Tromsø,

107
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,340
so north of Norway, north

108
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,561
of everything, basically.

109
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:02,306
You're not really at the top, top, top.

110
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,348
There would be a few more kilometers.

111
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,152
And what about you, [name]?

112
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:10,376
What would be your superpower?

113
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,438
I think my superpower would be flying.

114
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,140
I've always wanted that.

115
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,952
Yeah, that would be amazing.

116
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:19,974
I wrote there time traveling,

117
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,615
but not just with Git.

118
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,657
So actual time traveling would be fine.

119
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:26,219
But of course, I understand that

120
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,061
it's a bit too difficult.

121
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,263
But while everyone is connecting,

122
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,224
I could ask you a little bit,

123
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:34,727
how did you end up in

124
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,389
PROMSA doing research software

125
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,671
engineering related work?

126
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:43,435
What's the one minute story of your life?

127
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,777
I can start with [name].

128
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:47,620
I came as an Erasmus

129
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,903
student during my master's, and then

130
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:52,106
I got a PhD position offer, then a postdoc,

131
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,268
and now at this position

132
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,009
here in the research

133
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,571
software engineering group.

134
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:56,533
All right, interesting.

135
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,336
I wasn't planning to stay

136
00:11:58,336 --> 00:11:59,858
here for much longer than I

137
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,120
never managed to leave.

138
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,962
Yeah, I've seen this so many times

139
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,486
that nobody's sometimes planning

140
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:08,030
where to go, but then they

141
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,412
end up there and they will

142
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,255
stay there maybe for the rest of their lives.

143
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,197
What about you, [name]?

144
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:14,940
How did you end up in terms of

145
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:20,752
Well, I came to University in Tromsø

146
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:25,044
for doing a PhD and stuck around

147
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,107
and got hired to do

148
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:27,752
research software engineering and

149
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,795
high performance computing.

150
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,749
well this is really great so you

151
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,893
both kind of went there liked it there

152
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:37,096
but also on the other hand the people

153
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:38,658
who have been hiring you

154
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,860
they didn't want you to leave

155
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,642
because often you know we have the issue

156
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:44,666
that amazing doctoral doctoral

157
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,510
researchers they just leave because

158
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,212
they have a postdoc offer

159
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:50,874
somewhere else in the planet and

160
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,957
it's just lots of you know

161
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:56,120
knowledge and and clever people

162
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,122
that are leaving every time

163
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,082
that they finish but it's

164
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,785
good that some universities invest

165
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:02,966
and keep the people we try

166
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,268
to do the same sometimes at Aalto University

167
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:08,631
so in the icebreaker i see

168
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:11,814
some people are writing yeah no

169
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:14,716
need to sleep that's the superpower

170
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,359
you know we need to sleep

171
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,022
especially our brain needs need

172
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:22,423
sleep but also the body

173
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,502
Yeah, the any language, being

174
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:27,665
able to code speak in any

175
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,890
language, this is a very interesting one.

176
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,814
And I was watching the news

177
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:34,319
that they are planning, I don't know

178
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:35,722
if they are available, some

179
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:38,529
sort of like headphones, earphones

180
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:39,811
that you could, that would

181
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:41,455
do live translation.

182
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:42,677
so that you could talk

183
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,381
your language with anybody else

184
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:47,624
in talking another language and

185
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:50,108
they would live translate.

186
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,771
So if we talk about languages, not

187
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:53,493
yet programming languages, how

188
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,957
is your Norwegian, [name] and

189
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,720
[name], because I'm assuming you

190
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,304
are not native in Norway?

191
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:03,428
No, but I think Norwegian

192
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:04,991
is relatively easy to learn

193
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,293
if you speak German as a

194
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:06,974
native language and if you

195
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:07,515
speak English already.

196
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,399
So I guess I had an easier time than most.

197
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,611
Do you need to do

198
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,634
teaching or supporting Norwegian or

199
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,416
is it that you just do everything in English?

200
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,300
As a PhD student in postdoc,

201
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,342
I had to teach in Norwegian

202
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:21,123
in some bachelor class.

203
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:21,463
I see.

204
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,447
But I think it's easier in physics

205
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,709
than if it would be linguistics

206
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,711
or so because no one really cares

207
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:29,073
whether your Norwegian is perfect

208
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:29,794
as long as you're able

209
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:31,476
to communicate concepts.

210
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:32,819
Yeah.

211
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,502
In Finland, it's a bit

212
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:38,885
more challenging to learn the language.

213
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:41,247
I can do the very basics.

214
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,791
So [name], I noticed that you

215
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,574
had a little crash.

216
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:49,856
Yes, Zoom was being annoying.

217
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:51,117
All right.

218
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,901
Hopefully, it will not happen

219
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:55,601
during the stream.

220
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:57,903
If it happens, we know that

221
00:14:57,903 --> 00:14:59,505
you will be back a few seconds after.

222
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,964
And eventually [name] can scream for help.

223
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:04,666
We're all here with our camera off.

224
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:06,848
Right.

225
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:08,530
Then there's another icebreaker,

226
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,732
an important one before we start,

227
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,494
which is in preparation for today,

228
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,456
unless you are part of

229
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,099
an in-person classroom, we have

230
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:20,483
open an access request, or we are asking you

231
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,764
if you have opened an

232
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:25,328
access request issue so that

233
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:26,989
basically we can see your

234
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,353
GitHub handle username and, um,

235
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:37,131
and what and yeah actually this

236
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,840
is a good point that streaming

237
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,406
i think is showing

238
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,605
It's not showing my screen yet.

239
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:47,510
Oh, it got switched, I guess.

240
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,892
My screen is the one

241
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,816
with the icebreakers, yeah.

242
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,441
Yeah, so it's also going

243
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,284
to break the screen share.

244
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,967
That's good to remember.

245
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:58,029
That's good.

246
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:58,710
Let me know if the

247
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,954
screen share doesn't work or

248
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:02,497
if it's not showing the right thing.

249
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:05,724
So I was just showing these icebreakers.

250
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:07,889
And yeah, basically just a reminder,

251
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,572
if you click the link that

252
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,296
is there, you can request for access.

253
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,703
And then you will get an

254
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:16,407
email from GitHub to say that

255
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:17,830
you have been invited to be

256
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,215
a collaborator in this Git repository.

257
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:21,016
and then you need to

258
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,240
accept the invitation so it's

259
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,863
not enough just to request you

260
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:25,904
also need to wait for the

261
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,928
email and accept it and as

262
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,091
you know sometimes it might go to spam folder

263
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:32,475
or something like that so please check

264
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,078
and double check and we

265
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,820
will be checking this throughout the

266
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,107
day so if you see that you

267
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:43,172
don't have access or if you

268
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:46,017
are not sure just ask

269
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,559
All right, we have a couple

270
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,300
of minutes to go.

271
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,046
And anything else you want to say,

272
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,008
[name] and [name], before

273
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:56,909
we actually start?

274
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:00,894
Are you excited?

275
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:03,477
I am.

276
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:04,999
I think this is the most fun

277
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,040
day out of the course.

278
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:11,026
This is really the best day.

279
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,347
This is where you clearly see

280
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,249
the power of everything.

281
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:14,910
I know it.

282
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,907
how it joins together oh

283
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,211
yeah there was actually a nice question

284
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:23,093
or somebody noticed something

285
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,035
really interesting sorry if

286
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:26,578
i'm jumping between windows that

287
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,763
um then in our web page we

288
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,345
in the schedule of the workshop

289
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:34,087
we it used to say that there

290
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,810
was a gap between the icebreaker

291
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,213
and um and the workshop start

292
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:43,358
and so we fixed that and now basically

293
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,481
From next week, we will

294
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,805
have shorter workshop, no breaks,

295
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,468
and we start one hour after.

296
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,072
So that for those in

297
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,037
Oslo, Stockholm, Rome time zone, we

298
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,421
start at 12 and we end at 14.30.

299
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,284
There will be breaks, but

300
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:00,126
short breaks in between.

301
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:05,635
And someone is asking already,

302
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,177
what does it mean to be a collaborator?

303
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,501
But I will not spoil the fun.

304
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,022
and I have a look if we

305
00:18:13,022 --> 00:18:16,153
are yes 10 seconds before o'clock

306
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:20,588
and so we are ready to go

307
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:25,259
Hello everyone, we are starting

308
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,701
day three of the Code

309
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,666
Refinery workshop, September, October 2025.

310
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:33,372
I'm [name], I'm at Aalto University

311
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:34,954
and right now you might

312
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:37,578
already be seeing our instructors

313
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:39,702
of the day, [name] De Cristoforo.

314
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:41,224
Hello [name].

315
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:43,703
Hello.

316
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:46,647
and [name].

317
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,689
Did I pronounce it well?

318
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:47,969
Yes, you did.

319
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:48,890
Yes.

320
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,232
Hello, [name].

321
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:50,393
Hello.

322
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:51,955
But [name] and [name], they are

323
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:55,800
both in the UIT, University

324
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,523
of the Arctic of Norway.

325
00:18:57,523 --> 00:19:00,187
So up there in Tromsø.

326
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:00,788
They're part of the

327
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,330
Research Software Engineering Group

328
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,615
and they work with HPC and this type of stuff.

329
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:08,238
So lots of HPC experts

330
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:09,460
as instructors this year.

331
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,803
And you might also see [name].

332
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:12,444
Hello, [name].

333
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:13,606
Hello.

334
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:16,149
who is controlling the streaming

335
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,692
and the broadcasting for today right

336
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,294
so a couple of reminders

337
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,937
before we actually dive into the

338
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,599
best day well i mean i don't

339
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,481
want to say it's not maybe i don't know

340
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:27,643
if it's the best day but

341
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,725
one of the most amazing days

342
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:30,907
of the code refinery workshop

343
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,750
today it's day three and i'm

344
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,653
scrolling down to the schedule for

345
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:41,419
today and i click on this day three intro

346
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,983
and here we are so for day one

347
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,225
and two it was like

348
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,727
an introduction to version control

349
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,288
in day one you got all

350
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,591
the terms and you managed even

351
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,153
just using the github web

352
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:59,058
interface to do commits and things like

353
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:00,760
that for day two we kind

354
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,044
of moved on the local computer

355
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:05,806
which is very important because

356
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:08,669
then you already start feeling kind of the

357
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:10,891
the power of such tool that

358
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,893
you can work locally and when you're happy,

359
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:15,756
you can push on a remote place, GitHub,

360
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,079
GitLab, your server, whatever,

361
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,321
and collaborate with other people

362
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:23,544
who can then pull locally the

363
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:25,847
changes that you did and so on.

364
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,069
Today, which is day three,

365
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,311
everything comes together and we

366
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,593
show exactly this power of

367
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:36,057
the collaborative distributed version control.

368
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:38,001
so the concepts that are

369
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:39,804
introduced today they build on top of

370
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:41,447
what has been shown already in day one

371
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:46,978
and day two and so here

372
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,403
it's not necessary that you

373
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,427
do things locally you can also

374
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,651
use the GitHub web interface to

375
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,835
do this type of collaboration with others

376
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,537
But I really like I was saying

377
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:59,038
that this is the best day because

378
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,499
what you learn today is

379
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,001
something that even can go

380
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:06,344
beyond software engineering or code.

381
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:07,986
Because with this tool, with

382
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,728
what you will learn today, you can go out

383
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,829
and fix typos in documentation

384
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:15,333
of your favorite packages, software packages.

385
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,636
You can make web pages, help other people,

386
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:22,059
web pages and truly, you

387
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:24,461
know, unleash the power of

388
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:25,822
open source development.

389
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,747
What else?

390
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:28,950
Some practicalities.

391
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,339
I scroll up, I switch window

392
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,327
to this notes document, which

393
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,192
you should all have received via

394
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,757
email in the reminder that I

395
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:39,679
sent a minutes ago.

396
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:43,241
if you were not with us

397
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,206
in the previous days so in

398
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:46,609
this notes document on the

399
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,720
very top right corner which now

400
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,444
is hidden by our webcams but

401
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,389
it's okay you should see a pencil

402
00:21:55,592 --> 00:21:57,597
I can turn it off for a moment

403
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:59,879
yeah so you see my mouse

404
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,961
is moving there on top of the pencil

405
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,442
when I click the pencil it

406
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:06,385
will switch to like an editor edit mode

407
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:11,089
and here I'm scrolling down

408
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:12,731
and there's already some questions

409
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,572
and some of our helpers

410
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:16,734
have already answered and this

411
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:18,756
will be the main interface so

412
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:21,859
that everyone can ask and answer

413
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,380
at the same time you can

414
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,501
answer some of these questions

415
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:27,584
give your comments and feedback and and so on

416
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,989
but I don't want to steal precious time

417
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:33,691
so I switch back I click on

418
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,413
the eye it is also good

419
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:37,155
because then in this rendered

420
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,277
mode it's lighter for the server

421
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,582
so we can get the webcams back

422
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:46,705
and I think we could switch to

423
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:48,988
I think [name] is starting with

424
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:53,212
the screen share and enjoy

425
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:55,495
day three of Collaborative Git

426
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:57,557
Code Refinery workshop thank you

427
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,072
Yeah, thank you, Nico.

428
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,736
And welcome from our side.

429
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:03,738
I always consider this day to

430
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:04,840
be the most fun, since we

431
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,502
kind of build upon what we've

432
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:07,864
learned in the last two days.

433
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,186
And we now work together with

434
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,348
others on the same code base.

435
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,151
Expect today to be

436
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,514
slightly chaotic, because multiple

437
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:15,957
people will now work together

438
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:18,561
on pull requests, on code reviews.

439
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:21,004
We'll merge into one GitHub repository.

440
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,066
So not everything will work

441
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,789
according to plan, but that's fine.

442
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:26,545
That's part of the fun.

443
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:28,148
[name] already mentioned almost

444
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,951
everything in terms of bookkeeping

445
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,774
that was to be said.

446
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:32,815
Maybe just a few things on

447
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,138
my side that I want to add.

448
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:36,021
First of all, we will

449
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:38,264
have today three exercises and

450
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:39,466
you will have roughly 30

451
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:41,370
minutes for every exercise.

452
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,872
So it's a bit more time

453
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:45,445
than you did have in the last two days.

454
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:47,507
Um, so please keep an eye

455
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,490
on the Mata documents that

456
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,673
has mentioned, because we need to see that.

457
00:23:52,654 --> 00:23:53,875
What do you, at what stage

458
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:54,977
you are doing the exercises.

459
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:55,838
So please let us know

460
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:56,719
whether you're done or not,

461
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,441
whether you have any questions, this

462
00:23:58,441 --> 00:23:59,622
will be a central part now for

463
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:01,424
us to the way how we communicate to each other.

464
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:03,827
Also, please do remember the

465
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:04,768
code of conduct.

466
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:05,810
So please don't put anything

467
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,712
weird into the pull requests or

468
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,933
the reviews and so on.

469
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:13,599
Um, but otherwise, um, I think

470
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,440
we are ready to go.

471
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:17,625
As [name] already mentioned, so I

472
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,667
and [name], we both work at UIT

473
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,368
and we're a research soft

474
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:21,550
engineering group and we've both

475
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,312
worked as researchers before.

476
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:24,273
So in my case, it

477
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:26,216
was fusion plasma physics.

478
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:26,897
In the case of [name],

479
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:28,799
you have a background in

480
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,603
bioinformatics and computer science,

481
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,964
if I remember correctly.

482
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,145
Yes.

483
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:35,708
So what I'm trying to say

484
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,310
is we've been researchers, so we

485
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,231
have been in your shoes.

486
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,693
We know what kind of struggles

487
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:41,415
and challenges you have in

488
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:42,737
your everyday life when you work

489
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:44,399
with code as a researcher.

490
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,942
And hopefully we can

491
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,383
We can help you with most

492
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,485
of these topics now today during the seminar.

493
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:51,047
Okay.

494
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:53,449
I think that's all there is

495
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:55,411
to be said before we start with the lecture.

496
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,192
So I think we are ready to go ahead.

497
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:01,856
So the first thing we will

498
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:02,837
mention today is just a quick

499
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:04,058
reminder of the concepts that

500
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:05,640
we've discussed in the last few days.

501
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,961
So that's what is a repository?

502
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:07,622
What is a commit?

503
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:08,222
What is a branch?

504
00:25:08,222 --> 00:25:08,622
And so on.

505
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:10,784
You will have time during

506
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:11,965
the exercises to read up

507
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:13,026
on these concepts again, if

508
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,237
you feel slightly unsure about some of them.

509
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:16,078
You have 30 minutes, so

510
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,260
there's plenty of time to read

511
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,184
up on old topics and then build up on them.

512
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:21,485
But there is two specific things

513
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,467
that I want to pinpoint,

514
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,870
which we should emphasize now,

515
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,473
and that's cloning and forking the repository.

516
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:28,154
So I think that we

517
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:29,536
should start with discussing that

518
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:30,798
in a little bit more detail.

519
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,401
And a very easy way to

520
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:34,803
do that is by pointing out

521
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:37,057
this figure, which is shown here.

522
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:37,878
So what you can see here

523
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:39,580
now is a repository, which is

524
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,841
here indicated to be on GitHub.

525
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,263
So this cloud here refers

526
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,125
to a server, cloud server somewhere.

527
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,428
In this case, it's on GitHub.

528
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,729
And this repository here

529
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,091
contains multiple branches that you

530
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,412
can see here indicated in

531
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:51,654
these different colors.

532
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:52,855
So we have the blue main branch.

533
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,817
We have a green experimental branch.

534
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:55,978
We have this red ideas branch.

535
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,521
Every branch has multiple commits.

536
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:00,343
So each square here refers to a commit.

537
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,065
And we also have a tag here in this case.

538
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:04,310
So then the version 1.0 came out.

539
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,112
And then we can either clone

540
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:07,514
or fork this repository.

541
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,275
And you will do both

542
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,717
things today during the exercises.

543
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:11,879
So what you're already familiar

544
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:13,041
with is cloning.

545
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:13,942
So that means that you

546
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:15,925
copy the whole repository as one

547
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:18,147
piece to your laptop or

548
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,691
your workstation, wherever you work locally.

549
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:21,852
So you can see this then a copy,

550
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:22,993
which then changes here the

551
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:23,995
names of the branches, but

552
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,356
otherwise it stays exactly the same.

553
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:27,159
And then there's a second option,

554
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:27,960
which we will work in

555
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,862
the third exercise today, and that's forking.

556
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,012
And forking means that we

557
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:34,095
copy the repository inside of GitHub.

558
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:35,357
So we copy it from the

559
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:37,520
original place to another one,

560
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,963
usually your own GitHub account.

561
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:41,405
So then if this is,

562
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:42,927
for instance, the recipe book from

563
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:43,689
the code you found in the

564
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:44,730
repository, you would copy it

565
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,397
over to your personal GitHub repository.

566
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,401
And it stays exactly the same.

567
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:53,863
So conceptually, it's very much the same,

568
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:54,624
but we will see that in

569
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,646
exercise two and three what

570
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:56,507
the major differences are.

571
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:59,452
Now, maybe one of the first questions

572
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,554
that arise then is when

573
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:02,238
would you actually want to fork

574
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:03,982
and when would you want to clone?

575
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:05,285
So [name], may I ask you,

576
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:06,688
what do you usually do in

577
00:27:06,688 --> 00:27:08,392
your everyday life when you

578
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:09,935
work with code repositories?

579
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,361
In which case do you prefer

580
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,483
to clone and when do you fork?

581
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:17,332
Well, the main thing that decides

582
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,739
what you do is generally

583
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,243
whether you have right access

584
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,832
to the repository.

585
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:26,377
If you do, then you can

586
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:30,608
just clone and push your changes back.

587
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,314
In many cases, if you want to work on

588
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:36,958
or modify software that is managed

589
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,280
and maintained by someone else

590
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:41,365
at a different university or

591
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:46,713
wherever, it is easier to just make a fork

592
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:48,336
and then you can work on

593
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,339
it and modify it without

594
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:53,404
having to always request that

595
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,726
your changes be accepted.

596
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:57,869
Um, and so that's, that's

597
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:59,871
one main reason to fork as

598
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,973
instead of just cloning.

599
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,556
And often that's the case

600
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,218
when you work with repositories,

601
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:06,119
which are much bigger and

602
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,782
where multiple people are working in it.

603
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:08,883
So if it's just inside

604
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,645
of your own organization, if you only have two,

605
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:11,526
three people working on

606
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,249
one repository, then probably

607
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,510
cloning is enough.

608
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:17,474
But if you then want to contribute to,

609
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,837
let's say a large project, like NumPy,

610
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:20,939
for instance, for those of you

611
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:21,840
who work in Python, they

612
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,981
might recognize that immediately.

613
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,997
That's one of the most popular libraries.

614
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,098
then you cannot just clone that.

615
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:26,980
You would have to fork it

616
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,321
first and then work on the code.

617
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:30,745
So it's also correlated with

618
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:34,129
the size of the repository.

619
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,132
And one other reason that

620
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,514
people will fork is if they

621
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:40,318
want to take the particular code base

622
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,079
or software in a

623
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,280
completely different direction and

624
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,362
make changes that they have

625
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:46,346
either couldn't get accepted or

626
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:47,548
have no intention of trying to

627
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:49,811
merge back in with the original project.

628
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,043
Yes, that's also an option.

629
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,445
And also always keep in mind

630
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:55,346
what kind of license the

631
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:56,708
repositories use, right?

632
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,850
So if the license gives you

633
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,653
the rights to make changes to it and use it,

634
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:01,775
or if it's a restrictive

635
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,077
license, that's also something you

636
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:03,637
should keep in mind.

637
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,281
We will also learn today

638
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:07,763
how to synchronize the

639
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:09,565
changes between different repositories,

640
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:10,887
or like between fork repositories

641
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:12,409
and cloud repositories.

642
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:13,090
In the past, it has

643
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,212
been quite cumbersome on GitHub,

644
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,714
but they made it really easy now

645
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,897
in the UI, so it's just a few mouse clicks.

646
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:19,219
We will go through that later on as well.

647
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:22,945
And

648
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,026
We should also mention

649
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,188
generating repositories from templates.

650
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:27,530
That's relevant for those of you

651
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,852
who are now exercise class leaders,

652
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:30,633
so those of you who

653
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:35,277
will clone their repository for

654
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:36,298
your local group.

655
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,100
In this case, we can

656
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,722
use templates for that.

657
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:41,123
And the difference between a template

658
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,385
and a normal repository is

659
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:46,528
simply that a template will

660
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:47,389
flatten the history.

661
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:48,991
So it's like a Git squash,

662
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:50,806
if you remember from the previous days.

663
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,088
basically all the history

664
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:54,151
from this repository that you

665
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:55,793
cloned has been flattened so that

666
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,014
we start with an initial commit

667
00:29:57,014 --> 00:29:59,278
and start from a kind of new state.

668
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:00,079
So we don't have all the

669
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,402
history from the creation of the template.

670
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,385
So for those of you who will work on

671
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,626
or will lead an exercise

672
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,010
class, this will be important.

673
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:11,915
Okay, I think we have motivated

674
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:13,958
what we are working on today enough.

675
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,538
And I think we can

676
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:17,362
then start with introducing the first exercise.

677
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,898
Was there anything I have forgotten?

678
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,402
And I think that's everything.

679
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,247
Okay, so let's go to the next chapter.

680
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:27,471
And that's now collaborating

681
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:28,553
within the same repository.

682
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,578
So imagine you work together

683
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:33,882
with your research group on a package

684
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,324
that you develop, which is

685
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:36,346
at the moment only relevant

686
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:37,448
for two different people in

687
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:38,830
your research group, then you

688
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,711
probably would want to

689
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:41,254
start with collaborating inside

690
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:41,935
of one repository.

691
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:42,536
And that's what we will

692
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,678
practice now in this first round.

693
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,599
In this exercise, you will

694
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,623
be asked to create a pull request.

695
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,286
So what is a pull request?

696
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:52,087
Maybe we should give like

697
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,752
an explanation of the concept.

698
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,214
So if you haven't heard that before,

699
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,919
if the idea is to make

700
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,943
some changes to the code base, it

701
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,145
could be a new implementation.

702
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:03,587
It could be something completely new.

703
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:04,529
It could also be just a

704
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,811
change to existing code or a

705
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:09,598
fix of a mistake of a bug in the code and you

706
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:12,368
make this change as a proposal,

707
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:13,189
you put it out as a

708
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:15,833
proposal, so that other people can look at it,

709
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:16,794
give their opinion, say

710
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:17,475
whether they're happy with the

711
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,918
changes or not, and then get it merged.

712
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:20,979
So instead of merging it

713
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,662
directly into the main branch,

714
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:23,643
you have like this additional

715
00:31:25,726 --> 00:31:27,808
sets of controls that the changes

716
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,090
have to go through before you merge them.

717
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:35,198
In this exercise, we will now start with

718
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:41,809
the repository that is outlined here.

719
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:42,549
I'll just quickly give

720
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:45,073
some information about how the

721
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,374
team leaders would have to work with this.

722
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:49,698
And then I go to those of you

723
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:50,940
who are not in the team,

724
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,981
but will work directly with

725
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:54,785
the repository together with us.

726
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:56,367
So if you are part of a

727
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,930
team or an exercise room, please

728
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,034
go to this repository and book it.

729
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:05,098
And then you would have

730
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,898
to send invitations to all these people who are

731
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,380
parts of this group.

732
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,641
So I'll just quickly open

733
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:11,862
that in an additional tab.

734
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,444
So go to the tab now.

735
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:15,927
So you can hear, use this template.

736
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,348
And if you do that, then

737
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:18,970
you, I will just now show

738
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,852
the exercise that we will work on.

739
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:23,855
You can go to the settings

740
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:28,120
here, go to collaborators and

741
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,763
teams, and then you can invite people.

742
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:32,825
So in this case, let me

743
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,846
just make it a little bit

744
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:37,450
larger so that everyone can see.

745
00:32:38,982 --> 00:32:40,103
You have different roles, and

746
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:41,204
in this case it's important.

747
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:43,266
Okay, unfortunately I have to

748
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,087
scroll down to the right.

749
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:46,569
Let me see.

750
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:56,920
This is slightly difficult to see.

751
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,761
Let's just go back to the general one.

752
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:05,088
You will have to set it to read.

753
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,149
In this case, let's see, so

754
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:07,771
the, ah, here it is, sorry.

755
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:08,973
So we go to the team section.

756
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:20,495
Sorry, here it is.

757
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:20,816
OK.

758
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:22,720
I'm just not used to have

759
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:29,506
such large in the GitHub repository.

760
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,808
Here you have different roles,

761
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,929
so it will be important that

762
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,491
you set this to write, because

763
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,693
by default it might be read, which means

764
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:36,875
that those of you that

765
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:39,358
you invite to participate in this,

766
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,301
to work on this repository, will

767
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:44,504
not have the option to create,

768
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:48,068
yeah, to merge as pull requests.

769
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,349
So in this case, please set it to write.

770
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:52,092
Also, one thing that we can do,

771
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:54,075
which we should, which I want to mention,

772
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,236
is if you go to branches,

773
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:57,639
we can set additional rules for these branches.

774
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:59,577
And in this case, I've set up here a rule

775
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:00,818
for the main branch that

776
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:02,821
you have worked with already in

777
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,102
the last couple of days in

778
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:06,365
the code refinery workshop, we

779
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:09,509
can here add this additional

780
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:10,991
rule, which says that we require

781
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:12,272
a pull request before merging.

782
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:14,455
And I would recommend doing that

783
00:34:14,455 --> 00:34:15,716
for repositories where multiple

784
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,238
people work on it, since that means

785
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:21,664
that no one can just change

786
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:22,925
the code in the main branch

787
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:24,527
without anyone else approving the changes.

788
00:34:25,388 --> 00:34:26,129
So this is something that

789
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:27,431
you should enable, otherwise people

790
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:28,805
might just by accident

791
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,006
merge into the main byte, which

792
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:31,128
is not what we want to achieve today.

793
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,293
Okay, so let's go back to the material.

794
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,155
That was all the information

795
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:39,117
which is important for those of

796
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:44,023
you who manage a group of participants.

797
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:45,404
But those of you who

798
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:46,426
will work with decentralized

799
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,288
repositories, you will work together

800
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:49,970
with us, so with [name] and

801
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,371
also [name] and [name].

802
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:53,634
In this case, you have

803
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,016
two different options for this exercise.

804
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:57,939
You have the first one that

805
00:34:57,939 --> 00:34:59,045
we will not share,

806
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:00,587
in the stream, and then there

807
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:02,469
is one which we will show.

808
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:03,189
So this is the one that we

809
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:04,371
will show on the stream.

810
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:05,292
If you don't wish that

811
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:08,095
your username will be shown during the stream,

812
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:09,196
you will work on the

813
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:11,939
centralized workflow exercise repository.

814
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:12,940
And if you don't mind,

815
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,743
then please choose the recorded one.

816
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:16,544
It will be fun to see

817
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,166
a few people trying out this one as well,

818
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,088
so that we can see a

819
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:21,529
lot of different recipes that will be added.

820
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:23,972
Okay.

821
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,471
If you haven't already sent us

822
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:31,833
a request to be added to

823
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,155
the repository, please do so now.

824
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:34,377
You find all the instructions here.

825
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:36,400
We will then send you an invitation

826
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,161
and then which you need to

827
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:38,102
accept and then you can

828
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,947
participate in this repository.

829
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:44,352
And also one additional thing, by default,

830
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,754
you might have the setting

831
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:50,962
here to all activity, which is not

832
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,064
what you want since that would mean

833
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,125
that whenever someone creates

834
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,267
a pull request or an issue

835
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:55,749
in this repository, you will

836
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:57,027
be spammed by emails

837
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:59,470
So set it to participants and mentions.

838
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,152
That's a good idea.

839
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,554
Or you can also set it to ignore

840
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:03,255
so that you don't get

841
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:04,377
any notifications by email

842
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:08,202
whenever something happens in the repository.

843
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:10,004
OK.

844
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:13,368
So much about the whole UI stuff in GitHub.

845
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:14,570
But let's go to the lesson itself.

846
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:16,652
So we will work now

847
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,837
with this recipe cookbook.

848
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,539
So it's basically a collection

849
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:23,541
of different recipes in this repository.

850
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,325
Let me open that repository once again.

851
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,182
So if you go now to the

852
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:31,246
code, I'm now in this repository

853
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:32,047
that those of you will work

854
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:34,710
with who choose to work individually with us.

855
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,571
We are in the centralized

856
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:38,475
workflow exercise repository.

857
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:39,336
And you can see here, we

858
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:40,777
have here multiple directories,

859
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:43,681
which all contain different recipes.

860
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,183
So if I let's go to salads, for instance,

861
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,645
and I will just now open

862
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:48,266
a random document, let's say the

863
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,368
fruit salad in this case.

864
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,031
And you can see, we have here this file,

865
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:53,653
which contains an ingredient section

866
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:55,716
and also instructions, which are

867
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:56,937
in this case, relatively detailed.

868
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:58,878
Now, we don't ask you to spend

869
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:00,280
that much time on creating

870
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,522
a very sophisticated recipe.

871
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,084
It can be something super simple.

872
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:04,825
The idea is just that

873
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,467
you contribute or make a pull

874
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:07,428
request to a new recipe.

875
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:11,352
Now, some of the steps

876
00:37:11,352 --> 00:37:12,593
you're already familiar with.

877
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:13,775
So you will have to

878
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,318
first clone a repository, then create a branch,

879
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,399
then commit the changes to

880
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,121
a new branch, and then submit a pull request.

881
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:21,483
So that's what you've done so far already.

882
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:22,505
But then the new concepts here

883
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:27,430
will be how to push to this remote repository.

884
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:30,484
creates an issue, cross-reference

885
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:32,267
the issue in the pull request,

886
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:34,109
and then break the pull request.

887
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:35,611
The instructions are here, and

888
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:38,114
then you also find the solutions down here.

889
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,257
And checking the solutions is not cheating,

890
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,178
so please just have a look

891
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:44,342
at the solutions and follow them

892
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:45,984
in order to contribute.

893
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:48,247
Is there anything else we

894
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,889
should mention, or should we just

895
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:51,351
go into the exercises?

896
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:52,993
[name], did I forget anything?

897
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:55,156
Not that I'm aware.

898
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:55,797
That should be good.

899
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:59,871
Okay, so in this case, we

900
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,093
will then start the exercises.

901
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,518
It's now 20 past, so we

902
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:07,839
give you roughly half an hour.

903
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,362
So it's 10 to 12 in

904
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:12,164
Central European time, whatever that

905
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,747
is in your time area.

906
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:16,769
We will then get back to

907
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,731
you on the screen and then

908
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,052
start the break for 10 minutes.

909
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:21,093
So please use that break and

910
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:23,516
then we will go for this exercise ourselves.

911
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,460
So [name] will then contribute

912
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,624
a new recipe to the repository

913
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:30,670
and then we will go for the exercise together.

914
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:35,359
Okay, then I'll leave you

915
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,944
to the exercises and see you in half an hour.

916
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:38,305
Bye.

917
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:24,950
Hey, welcome back from the exercises.

918
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:27,674
You can see that there is

919
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:28,996
already a lot of nice

920
01:08:28,996 --> 01:08:30,499
contributions to the recipe book.

921
01:08:30,499 --> 01:08:31,820
So thank you all for contributing.

922
01:08:33,022 --> 01:08:33,964
So you can see here in

923
01:08:33,964 --> 01:08:35,426
this repository, the central aspect

924
01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:37,389
for exercises recorded repository,

925
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:38,570
there's a bunch of issues, a

926
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,053
lot of them have already been closed as well.

927
01:08:40,854 --> 01:08:42,035
There's a lot of pull

928
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,377
requests, many of them have

929
01:08:43,377 --> 01:08:45,260
also been already matched.

930
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,382
So thank you all for contributing.

931
01:08:46,382 --> 01:08:47,043
That looks really good.

932
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:49,066
Before we go into the break

933
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:50,488
in 30 seconds, let me just

934
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:53,056
quickly show you the graph.

935
01:08:53,056 --> 01:08:55,159
So we can go here on insights

936
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:56,280
and the repository, and you can

937
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,061
go to the network.

938
01:08:58,062 --> 01:08:59,083
And that gives us a very

939
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,326
good overview of the different

940
01:09:01,326 --> 01:09:03,128
branches and who's working on what.

941
01:09:03,128 --> 01:09:04,410
So we can see here the main branch,

942
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,111
and then we see here

943
01:09:05,111 --> 01:09:07,013
already some merged branches.

944
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:08,014
This is the other one, for

945
01:09:08,014 --> 01:09:09,376
instance, and we have some

946
01:09:09,376 --> 01:09:10,397
branches here, which are open.

947
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,020
So we can see there's

948
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,202
a lot of contributions already made.

949
01:09:15,604 --> 01:09:16,124
Okay.

950
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:17,828
So let's go into the break.

951
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:19,496
for 10 minutes and afterwards,

952
01:09:19,496 --> 01:09:21,284
[name] will create his own pull

953
01:09:21,284 --> 01:09:22,208
request and we will discuss

954
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,353
the whole exercise in detail.

955
01:09:25,423 --> 01:09:26,387
See you then, bye.

956
01:19:40,482 --> 01:19:41,904
Okay, welcome back, everyone.

957
01:19:43,926 --> 01:19:44,647
I see that a lot of

958
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,430
you have already submitted very nice recipes.

959
01:19:47,311 --> 01:19:48,052
Thank you all for that.

960
01:19:49,173 --> 01:19:50,415
And I have seen that there

961
01:19:50,415 --> 01:19:51,836
was a couple of questions

962
01:19:51,836 --> 01:19:53,138
about these automated tests.

963
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:55,161
So if you know, look here

964
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:57,404
at the repository again.

965
01:19:57,404 --> 01:19:58,545
So I'm here to centralize

966
01:19:58,545 --> 01:19:59,646
that exercise is recorded one.

967
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:01,629
You can see that some of

968
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:03,171
these recipes have like this

969
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:04,713
green checkmark and some of them

970
01:20:04,713 --> 01:20:06,615
have this red X, which

971
01:20:06,615 --> 01:20:07,657
we haven't discussed yet.

972
01:20:07,657 --> 01:20:08,878
So let's, let's have a look.

973
01:20:08,878 --> 01:20:09,699
Let's let's click on it

974
01:20:09,699 --> 01:20:10,320
and see what's happening.

975
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:11,909
So we have here this

976
01:20:11,909 --> 01:20:14,252
really nice biryani recipe that has been added.

977
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:19,520
And if you scroll down, aha, okay.

978
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,321
It tells us that there

979
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:21,042
have been some checks.

980
01:20:22,144 --> 01:20:23,365
We'll discuss them in a minute.

981
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:24,106
And if you look at them,

982
01:20:25,629 --> 01:20:27,391
it gives us an error message.

983
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:27,731
Okay.

984
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,617
Looks like the instructions are missing.

985
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:36,286
Okay, so what is this test here?

986
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:37,467
That's something that we'll discuss

987
01:20:37,467 --> 01:20:38,489
in more detail later on.

988
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:39,130
And also there will be

989
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,392
a whole section about this in

990
01:20:40,392 --> 01:20:43,356
a later stage of this workshop, so not today.

991
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:46,640
But just to give you a hint already,

992
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,683
so on GitHub, we can

993
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,508
create additional tests, which are

994
01:20:52,508 --> 01:20:56,594
here in this .github workflow directory.

995
01:20:56,594 --> 01:20:57,435
So let's click on that.

996
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:00,892
And here we have a file,

997
01:21:00,892 --> 01:21:03,114
which is called check-recipes.yaml.

998
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:05,076
So let's open that.

999
01:21:07,578 --> 01:21:10,381
And this now contains the tests

1000
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:11,622
that we run every time you

1001
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:12,763
create a pull request and if

1002
01:21:12,763 --> 01:21:15,246
you push towards the repository.

1003
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:16,187
So at the beginning, it gives

1004
01:21:16,187 --> 01:21:17,228
us a name of this check.

1005
01:21:17,228 --> 01:21:18,870
In this case, it's just basic recipe check.

1006
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,152
We can specify which branches

1007
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,733
we want to run these checks on,

1008
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:24,435
on main in this case.

1009
01:21:26,018 --> 01:21:27,760
And then down here, we can

1010
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,422
then specify on what kind of

1011
01:21:29,422 --> 01:21:30,223
server this is running.

1012
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:31,785
So this is something that GitHub provides.

1013
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:32,726
So in this case, we just

1014
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,568
use a standard Linux server.

1015
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:36,290
And then at the very end,

1016
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,511
this is the relevant part.

1017
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:39,293
We run a file, which is

1018
01:21:39,293 --> 01:21:41,496
called Python check recipes.

1019
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,237
And if you go back to

1020
01:21:42,237 --> 01:21:43,838
the repository, you can see that

1021
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:44,559
there is this file.

1022
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:47,382
Now, if you don't know

1023
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:48,824
Python syntax, that's perfectly fine.

1024
01:21:48,824 --> 01:21:49,605
You don't have to understand

1025
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:50,947
what's going on here.

1026
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:51,687
So let me just tell you

1027
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:53,339
the only thing that this file does

1028
01:21:53,339 --> 01:21:55,061
is it checks whether there

1029
01:21:55,061 --> 01:21:56,162
is an ingredients and an

1030
01:21:56,162 --> 01:21:58,745
instruction section in the recipe.

1031
01:21:58,745 --> 01:21:59,326
That's all it does.

1032
01:22:00,147 --> 01:22:01,048
And then if there is one,

1033
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,109
it gives a green check.

1034
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:03,270
And then if there isn't one,

1035
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,391
then it gives this red cross.

1036
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:06,814
Now, this is of course

1037
01:22:06,814 --> 01:22:08,536
a somehow silly example, like

1038
01:22:08,536 --> 01:22:10,198
you would use this later on, for instance,

1039
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:12,521
if you have tests written for your code

1040
01:22:12,521 --> 01:22:13,341
and you want to make sure

1041
01:22:13,341 --> 01:22:14,182
that every time there's a

1042
01:22:14,182 --> 01:22:15,944
new contribution to your code,

1043
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:17,366
that this doesn't break any

1044
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,428
of the existing functionalities of

1045
01:22:19,428 --> 01:22:20,089
your code base.

1046
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,861
But in this particular case,

1047
01:22:21,861 --> 01:22:22,923
we can now have a look

1048
01:22:22,923 --> 01:22:24,104
why this exactly happened.

1049
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,829
So let's go to the changes.

1050
01:22:27,829 --> 01:22:28,971
We can click on file changed.

1051
01:22:31,835 --> 01:22:33,076
And we see, okay, the problem

1052
01:22:33,076 --> 01:22:36,741
is that this user outsmarted us.

1053
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:38,924
Like the check is really stupid

1054
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:39,905
and just checks whether there's

1055
01:22:39,905 --> 01:22:42,529
a hashtag, hashtag ingredients

1056
01:22:42,529 --> 01:22:43,811
and instruction section.

1057
01:22:43,811 --> 01:22:45,212
What we haven't thought of is

1058
01:22:45,212 --> 01:22:46,955
that you might use Unicode characters here,

1059
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,697
which look really nice,

1060
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,179
but unfortunately our tests have

1061
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:50,920
not been prepared for.

1062
01:22:54,258 --> 01:22:55,860
So one could change that

1063
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:59,225
by suggesting to, there's a refresh button.

1064
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:00,106
Let's click that.

1065
01:23:00,106 --> 01:23:01,509
Someone has made changes to it right now.

1066
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,657
Okay, these things have not been changed,

1067
01:23:07,657 --> 01:23:08,919
but what we could do now

1068
01:23:08,919 --> 01:23:10,121
is to suggest to make the

1069
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:12,004
changes here, to remove this

1070
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:14,527
Unicode character here, and then

1071
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:15,929
the tests would pass.

1072
01:23:16,851 --> 01:23:17,632
So this was just a

1073
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:22,419
quick kind of introduction to tests.

1074
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:23,380
We'll discuss it in further

1075
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:23,961
detail later on,

1076
01:23:25,207 --> 01:23:25,607
Okay.

1077
01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:28,410
I think it's time that we

1078
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,592
now discuss the whole exercise

1079
01:23:30,592 --> 01:23:31,412
in further detail.

1080
01:23:31,412 --> 01:23:33,714
So [name], can I give you

1081
01:23:33,714 --> 01:23:36,116
the mic and you would focus for the exercise?

1082
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:37,898
Sure.

1083
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:40,200
Okay.

1084
01:23:41,981 --> 01:23:43,302
And I guess we can switch

1085
01:23:43,302 --> 01:23:44,683
to my screen share.

1086
01:23:48,387 --> 01:23:49,307
Oh, sorry.

1087
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:53,331
Let's unpause that, resume.

1088
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:54,792
Okay, there we go.

1089
01:23:55,717 --> 01:23:57,439
All right, so we're working

1090
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:00,322
our way through the exercise tasks.

1091
01:24:00,322 --> 01:24:02,023
We begin with opening an issue.

1092
01:24:02,023 --> 01:24:04,206
And so let's find a

1093
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,108
particular issue that we have

1094
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:08,610
that needs modifying.

1095
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:09,431
So here I'm looking at

1096
01:24:09,431 --> 01:24:10,552
the guacamole recipe.

1097
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:13,595
And I happen to think that

1098
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:15,076
it needs some garlic to give

1099
01:24:15,076 --> 01:24:15,957
it a little more kick.

1100
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,382
So let's go ahead and do that.

1101
01:24:20,382 --> 01:24:21,623
So we'll create an issue here.

1102
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:24,841
And let me just resize this

1103
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:25,884
so we can see that.

1104
01:24:25,884 --> 01:24:26,787
Here's our new issue.

1105
01:24:29,915 --> 01:24:33,024
And we'll call it guacamole

1106
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:37,215
needs more garlic or it needs garlic.

1107
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:48,370
Okay, guacamole tastes better if

1108
01:24:49,411 --> 01:24:50,753
it has garlic.

1109
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:59,044
So we should include it as an ingredient.

1110
01:25:01,428 --> 01:25:03,370
Okay, so there's our issue

1111
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,193
that we can reference and we'll

1112
01:25:05,193 --> 01:25:06,915
go ahead and click on create there.

1113
01:25:08,262 --> 01:25:10,625
All right, now heading back

1114
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:11,425
over to the code.

1115
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,129
So here we're not working

1116
01:25:15,129 --> 01:25:17,772
locally, so we're going to skip step two.

1117
01:25:17,772 --> 01:25:20,155
If you are working locally,

1118
01:25:20,155 --> 01:25:25,260
then you need to clone using the URL here.

1119
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:28,424
And that's covered elsewhere, so

1120
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:30,346
I'm not going to go over that right now.

1121
01:25:30,346 --> 01:25:31,387
But we need to create our

1122
01:25:31,387 --> 01:25:33,409
new branch that's going to contain our changes.

1123
01:25:34,942 --> 01:25:37,887
So here we can just type

1124
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:43,035
in, and I'm all for descriptive naming.

1125
01:25:43,035 --> 01:25:49,825
So guacamole, add garlic.

1126
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:51,748
Okay, and so we can say

1127
01:25:51,748 --> 01:25:55,755
create that branch from Maine.

1128
01:25:57,097 --> 01:25:57,878
And so there we go.

1129
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,662
So now we're working in

1130
01:26:00,662 --> 01:26:02,926
this branch rather than main.

1131
01:26:02,926 --> 01:26:04,488
You can see that it doesn't say main here.

1132
01:26:04,488 --> 01:26:06,131
It says guacamole, add garlic.

1133
01:26:06,973 --> 01:26:07,714
And so now we're going to

1134
01:26:07,714 --> 01:26:09,377
go ahead and make this modification.

1135
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,122
If you're working locally, this

1136
01:26:12,122 --> 01:26:12,803
would be where you would

1137
01:26:12,803 --> 01:26:15,207
edit the file directly, but we're

1138
01:26:15,207 --> 01:26:17,451
going to do that in GitHub.

1139
01:26:18,613 --> 01:26:20,957
So here's the guacamole recipe

1140
01:26:20,957 --> 01:26:23,141
here, and we can go and edit it.

1141
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:24,523
And there's the edit this file.

1142
01:26:27,406 --> 01:26:29,209
And so we can go down

1143
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:40,529
here and add two cloves of garlic.

1144
01:26:42,453 --> 01:26:43,555
And then additionally in

1145
01:26:43,555 --> 01:26:49,465
the instructions, mince garlic.

1146
01:26:52,533 --> 01:26:54,535
Okay, so there we go.

1147
01:26:54,535 --> 01:26:56,517
And we can then go back up

1148
01:26:56,517 --> 01:26:58,159
here and go to commit changes.

1149
01:27:01,242 --> 01:27:02,704
And so then when our

1150
01:27:02,704 --> 01:27:08,910
commit message add garlic, and we

1151
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,392
can add an extended description,

1152
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,513
but I think it's pretty simple.

1153
01:27:12,654 --> 01:27:15,016
Here, we can add garlic

1154
01:27:16,658 --> 01:27:21,443
as an ingredient and include.

1155
01:27:22,975 --> 01:27:24,839
instruction item.

1156
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:26,361
OK.

1157
01:27:27,484 --> 01:27:32,233
So we can then commit that.

1158
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,295
There is also an option.

1159
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:34,337
We could have skipped the

1160
01:27:34,337 --> 01:27:37,022
branch creation previously and just

1161
01:27:37,022 --> 01:27:40,729
done that right here and given it a new one.

1162
01:27:40,729 --> 01:27:44,356
And that's fine if you're just doing one

1163
01:27:44,356 --> 01:27:47,340
one change, but in this case,

1164
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,281
you often may want to

1165
01:27:48,281 --> 01:27:49,543
have multiple files change and

1166
01:27:49,543 --> 01:27:52,507
so it's easier to use a

1167
01:27:52,507 --> 01:27:54,330
dedicated branch that you've already created.

1168
01:27:55,472 --> 01:27:57,214
Okay, so then we'll commit changes.

1169
01:28:01,099 --> 01:28:05,546
Okay, and so then we can see that

1170
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,528
that is now added there and

1171
01:28:07,528 --> 01:28:09,391
we have the instruction there.

1172
01:28:10,613 --> 01:28:12,996
Okay, and then going back

1173
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:16,104
We can see that it says

1174
01:28:16,104 --> 01:28:20,048
now that this branch is one commit ahead.

1175
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:22,210
And because of that, we

1176
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,071
have the option here to

1177
01:28:23,071 --> 01:28:26,414
contribute our changes back to the main branch.

1178
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:28,856
And so let's see, looking

1179
01:28:28,856 --> 01:28:31,158
at the instructions here, we've

1180
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:32,939
created a change on the new branch.

1181
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:36,142
Oh, we forgot to commit

1182
01:28:36,142 --> 01:28:37,484
the cross-reference to the issue.

1183
01:28:38,484 --> 01:28:40,807
So let's go back and do that real quick.

1184
01:28:40,807 --> 01:28:42,868
First of all, the issue is number 23.

1185
01:28:42,868 --> 01:28:44,650
We can see that here.

1186
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:48,117
Then let's come back over and

1187
01:28:48,117 --> 01:28:51,303
go to this commit.

1188
01:28:51,303 --> 01:28:57,715
Okay.

1189
01:29:00,732 --> 01:29:01,753
Well, I think we'll just

1190
01:29:02,694 --> 01:29:04,997
reference that in the pull request.

1191
01:29:04,997 --> 01:29:06,800
So here we have the option

1192
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,901
then to create the pull request.

1193
01:29:07,901 --> 01:29:09,002
As you can see, we can

1194
01:29:09,002 --> 01:29:11,225
create it from the commit itself,

1195
01:29:11,225 --> 01:29:15,731
or we also have the option to,

1196
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:18,274
if we're in that particular branch,

1197
01:29:19,215 --> 01:29:22,239
to use the contribute option here.

1198
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,963
So let's do that open pull request.

1199
01:29:25,963 --> 01:29:26,884
Let's make sure.

1200
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:28,326
Yeah, open pull request towards

1201
01:29:28,326 --> 01:29:29,828
the main branch, step six.

1202
01:29:31,732 --> 01:29:32,933
open pull request.

1203
01:29:34,775 --> 01:29:37,698
Okay, so here we have the description.

1204
01:29:37,698 --> 01:29:46,346
This solves the issue number 23,

1205
01:29:46,346 --> 01:29:48,409
and it automatically knows where

1206
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:49,009
that is for us.

1207
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,131
And then we can do this.

1208
01:29:51,992 --> 01:29:56,216
Okay, so we now can then

1209
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:57,958
create the pull request.

1210
01:30:02,107 --> 01:30:06,973
Okay, so now it is telling

1211
01:30:06,973 --> 01:30:08,535
us that we have a review required.

1212
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:10,217
And it is also, as we

1213
01:30:10,217 --> 01:30:11,838
can see right here, that it

1214
01:30:11,838 --> 01:30:15,423
is performing the basic recipe checks.

1215
01:30:15,423 --> 01:30:19,547
And since the ingredients heading

1216
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:23,032
and the instructions headings were

1217
01:30:23,032 --> 01:30:24,954
both there properly, then

1218
01:30:24,954 --> 01:30:27,737
that particular pass check passes.

1219
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:30,781
[name], do you want to switch

1220
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:31,962
to your share and do the review?

1221
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:33,897
We can.

1222
01:30:33,897 --> 01:30:35,227
First, what you could do is

1223
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:36,516
to assign me as a reviewer.

1224
01:30:36,516 --> 01:30:37,382
That's something we could share.

1225
01:30:37,382 --> 01:30:37,986
Sure, yeah.

1226
01:30:39,755 --> 01:30:40,616
OK.

1227
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:46,144
Yes, now this we have this

1228
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,446
window is very narrow, so

1229
01:30:47,446 --> 01:30:51,412
that assignment is shows up in the bottom.

1230
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,554
If we were to actually have

1231
01:30:52,554 --> 01:30:55,598
a normal sized window that's going

1232
01:30:55,598 --> 01:30:57,101
to show up on the right hand

1233
01:30:57,101 --> 01:31:00,566
side here so we can see here reviewers.

1234
01:31:00,566 --> 01:31:01,848
And so then it makes a

1235
01:31:01,848 --> 01:31:04,231
suggestion here and we can request that.

1236
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:06,274
We also click here and search

1237
01:31:06,274 --> 01:31:07,997
for or choose a user that way.

1238
01:31:07,997 --> 01:31:09,539
So we'll go ahead and click on

1239
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:12,303
[name] there.

1240
01:31:12,303 --> 01:31:15,508
And so he is now listed

1241
01:31:15,508 --> 01:31:17,531
as a reviewer and will

1242
01:31:17,531 --> 01:31:19,434
hopefully approve our changes.

1243
01:31:21,938 --> 01:31:23,060
So over to you, [name].

1244
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:26,305
Okay, thank you.

1245
01:31:27,848 --> 01:31:29,049
So we'll now wait until

1246
01:31:30,932 --> 01:31:31,914
I'm sharing the screen again.

1247
01:31:36,401 --> 01:31:37,082
Okay, here we go.

1248
01:31:38,615 --> 01:31:39,896
Nice, so I'm now still

1249
01:31:39,896 --> 01:31:40,897
in the same repository.

1250
01:31:40,897 --> 01:31:42,559
And I see in the issues, I see

1251
01:31:42,559 --> 01:31:46,704
that [name] has created this issue

1252
01:31:46,704 --> 01:31:47,424
where he says that the

1253
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:48,866
guacamole recipe needs more garlic,

1254
01:31:51,309 --> 01:31:52,210
which is quite nice.

1255
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,211
I can already see that there

1256
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:55,073
is a pull request here linked to it.

1257
01:31:55,073 --> 01:31:56,314
So that's because [name] has

1258
01:31:56,314 --> 01:31:58,897
now linked the pull request

1259
01:31:58,897 --> 01:32:00,218
to this issue number.

1260
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:03,021
So that's what shows up already here.

1261
01:32:03,021 --> 01:32:04,723
So I could now click on that directly.

1262
01:32:05,665 --> 01:32:06,686
But of course, I could also

1263
01:32:06,686 --> 01:32:07,727
find the same thing if I

1264
01:32:07,727 --> 01:32:09,149
click on pull request here, it

1265
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:09,849
will also show up.

1266
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:11,932
So I will now open this file.

1267
01:32:14,554 --> 01:32:16,256
Okay, so let's have a look.

1268
01:32:17,457 --> 01:32:18,318
So what are the first things

1269
01:32:18,318 --> 01:32:19,600
you should do when you look

1270
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,563
at a pull request as a reviewer?

1271
01:32:22,563 --> 01:32:23,824
So first of all, of course,

1272
01:32:23,824 --> 01:32:25,005
let's look at the title.

1273
01:32:25,005 --> 01:32:26,086
Does this seem to make sense?

1274
01:32:27,107 --> 01:32:28,669
Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

1275
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:29,630
That's something we can work on.

1276
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:31,332
It's not some kind of

1277
01:32:31,332 --> 01:32:32,253
spam or something which has

1278
01:32:32,253 --> 01:32:33,394
no relevance for the project.

1279
01:32:35,163 --> 01:32:36,204
Now, if you scroll down, what

1280
01:32:36,204 --> 01:32:36,705
do we see here?

1281
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:40,809
We see the initial message

1282
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:42,591
that [name] has written.

1283
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:45,094
I can click here to see the commits.

1284
01:32:45,094 --> 01:32:46,555
So in this case, it's one simple commit.

1285
01:32:46,555 --> 01:32:47,416
So this would then show

1286
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:49,578
me the commit message, which

1287
01:32:49,578 --> 01:32:50,800
you remember from the previous days.

1288
01:32:52,862 --> 01:32:54,544
Now, since we have a check,

1289
01:32:54,544 --> 01:32:55,885
it also shows me whether

1290
01:32:55,885 --> 01:32:56,706
the checks have passed.

1291
01:32:56,706 --> 01:32:57,827
In this case, they have.

1292
01:32:57,827 --> 01:32:59,589
So everything seems to be fine.

1293
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,711
And now the most important tab

1294
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:03,533
is this one called Files Changed.

1295
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:05,557
because that actually shows me

1296
01:33:05,557 --> 01:33:06,438
the changes in the code.

1297
01:33:06,438 --> 01:33:09,761
So I will click on that now.

1298
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:10,102
Okay.

1299
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,347
So in this tab, it shows

1300
01:33:15,347 --> 01:33:17,309
me which documents or which

1301
01:33:17,309 --> 01:33:19,131
files have been changed in this pull request.

1302
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:20,352
In this case, it's only one.

1303
01:33:20,352 --> 01:33:22,054
It's in the site directory

1304
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:24,136
and it's the guacamole.md, so

1305
01:33:24,136 --> 01:33:25,737
this markdown document.

1306
01:33:25,737 --> 01:33:27,039
If this pull request would

1307
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:28,500
contain multiple files that

1308
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,282
have contained changes, then they

1309
01:33:30,282 --> 01:33:31,343
would be listed down here.

1310
01:33:32,352 --> 01:33:33,233
So we could scroll down

1311
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,014
and then multiple files would be listed here.

1312
01:33:35,975 --> 01:33:36,756
In this case, there was

1313
01:33:36,756 --> 01:33:38,337
only two lines which are added.

1314
01:33:39,378 --> 01:33:40,879
So if this pull request

1315
01:33:40,879 --> 01:33:41,900
would delete some lines or

1316
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:44,422
rename them, they would also appear as red.

1317
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:45,944
So you've probably already seen it.

1318
01:33:45,944 --> 01:33:47,145
If you have reviewed some

1319
01:33:47,145 --> 01:33:48,226
other pull requests, otherwise you

1320
01:33:48,226 --> 01:33:49,747
will see probably later.

1321
01:33:49,747 --> 01:33:52,189
So if like [name] would have said, okay,

1322
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:53,770
I don't want any onions in my recipe,

1323
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:54,971
then this would have been

1324
01:33:54,971 --> 01:34:00,977
shown as missing now in this pull request.

1325
01:34:00,977 --> 01:34:01,397
Okay.

1326
01:34:02,339 --> 01:34:05,722
So what should we do now as a reviewer?

1327
01:34:05,722 --> 01:34:06,383
First of all, we have a

1328
01:34:06,383 --> 01:34:07,464
look whether the changes in the

1329
01:34:07,464 --> 01:34:08,565
code make any sense.

1330
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:09,346
So in this case, we see

1331
01:34:09,346 --> 01:34:11,168
that the only changes that happened

1332
01:34:11,168 --> 01:34:13,650
is that two cloves of garlic have been added.

1333
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:14,791
And in the instructions, we

1334
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:17,234
see that the garlic needs to be minced.

1335
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:18,655
So that's very simple.

1336
01:34:18,655 --> 01:34:19,876
There's not many things going on here.

1337
01:34:20,877 --> 01:34:21,738
So in this case, I can

1338
01:34:21,738 --> 01:34:22,599
then click on review.

1339
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:26,883
And since it's just very small changes,

1340
01:34:26,883 --> 01:34:28,005
I will just approve them

1341
01:34:28,005 --> 01:34:30,507
right away and write a nice message.

1342
01:34:39,953 --> 01:34:40,674
something like that.

1343
01:34:43,098 --> 01:34:44,520
And I can submit a review

1344
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,344
and say that I approve this request.

1345
01:34:49,948 --> 01:34:50,670
Now, I think it's always

1346
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:52,993
very important to be very polite

1347
01:34:52,993 --> 01:34:54,996
since in this case, it didn't

1348
01:34:54,996 --> 01:34:57,320
take [name] a lot of time to make this change,

1349
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,882
but let's assume this is now

1350
01:34:58,882 --> 01:35:00,505
a very large code base and

1351
01:35:00,505 --> 01:35:05,092
[name] has spent weeks on working

1352
01:35:05,092 --> 01:35:06,434
on a specific feature that

1353
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:08,422
he contributed to this project.

1354
01:35:08,422 --> 01:35:09,303
And if you then kind of

1355
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:10,825
submit like after weeks of

1356
01:35:10,825 --> 01:35:12,468
work, it's pull request.

1357
01:35:12,468 --> 01:35:14,511
And then the only feedback you

1358
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:15,612
get from a reviewer is like,

1359
01:35:15,612 --> 01:35:16,614
here's a spelling mistake.

1360
01:35:16,614 --> 01:35:18,316
And here is like something

1361
01:35:18,316 --> 01:35:19,338
which is not really relevant.

1362
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:21,521
Then this can be quite discouraging.

1363
01:35:21,521 --> 01:35:23,103
So I think it's always very important

1364
01:35:23,103 --> 01:35:24,525
that the first time an

1365
01:35:24,525 --> 01:35:26,027
external person collaborates with

1366
01:35:26,027 --> 01:35:27,009
a new project that it gets

1367
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:30,133
welcomed and gets a good impression.

1368
01:35:30,133 --> 01:35:31,916
Because otherwise, if you would

1369
01:35:31,916 --> 01:35:33,017
be now very nitpicky and

1370
01:35:33,017 --> 01:35:34,720
mean, then [name] would probably

1371
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:35,901
think twice whether he would

1372
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:37,163
want to contribute to that project again.

1373
01:35:38,712 --> 01:35:39,072
Okay.

1374
01:35:40,114 --> 01:35:40,995
And in this case, I

1375
01:35:40,995 --> 01:35:42,237
think everything seems fine.

1376
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,578
So we can go ahead and

1377
01:35:43,578 --> 01:35:44,480
merge the pull request.

1378
01:35:48,745 --> 01:35:49,747
And guess what this merge is?

1379
01:35:49,747 --> 01:35:51,309
It's another commit, right?

1380
01:35:51,309 --> 01:35:53,552
So we can here create a commit message.

1381
01:35:53,552 --> 01:35:55,033
In this case, it already

1382
01:35:55,033 --> 01:35:58,959
has this proposal here, which

1383
01:35:58,959 --> 01:36:00,160
is simply merge pull request

1384
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,283
number 24 from this branch

1385
01:36:02,283 --> 01:36:03,044
into the main branch.

1386
01:36:04,346 --> 01:36:05,127
So in this case, now we

1387
01:36:05,127 --> 01:36:06,829
click on that merge.

1388
01:36:11,011 --> 01:36:12,493
And now what I can do

1389
01:36:12,493 --> 01:36:13,694
is to delete the branch.

1390
01:36:13,694 --> 01:36:14,896
And that is safe to do,

1391
01:36:14,896 --> 01:36:16,078
because now the changes from

1392
01:36:16,078 --> 01:36:17,259
this particular branch are already

1393
01:36:17,259 --> 01:36:18,300
in the main branch, so all

1394
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,443
the checks have been stored.

1395
01:36:20,443 --> 01:36:21,404
So I can now delete this one.

1396
01:36:23,347 --> 01:36:24,408
It's often good practice to

1397
01:36:24,408 --> 01:36:26,351
delete unused branches, stale

1398
01:36:26,351 --> 01:36:28,213
branches, so that you keep a good overview.

1399
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:30,797
If you would now go to the code

1400
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:37,025
and have a look here at

1401
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:38,847
the history of our repository, then

1402
01:36:38,847 --> 01:36:39,668
we see here that

1403
01:36:40,897 --> 01:36:42,200
The latest commit now refers

1404
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,162
to the launch pull request.

1405
01:36:46,309 --> 01:36:47,311
One thing we haven't mentioned

1406
01:36:47,311 --> 01:36:49,776
yet are draft pull requests.

1407
01:36:50,578 --> 01:36:51,681
I really quickly want to

1408
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:52,763
mention them since that was one

1409
01:36:52,763 --> 01:36:53,725
point of the exercise.

1410
01:36:55,325 --> 01:36:55,906
Sure.

1411
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,132
Certainly, there are times

1412
01:37:00,132 --> 01:37:02,376
when it's important that you

1413
01:37:02,376 --> 01:37:04,579
keep your collaborators informed

1414
01:37:04,579 --> 01:37:06,382
of your progress, that they can review it

1415
01:37:07,384 --> 01:37:10,248
and catch if you're heading

1416
01:37:10,248 --> 01:37:11,490
off in the wrong direction as

1417
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:13,533
far as the approach that you're taking.

1418
01:37:13,533 --> 01:37:15,896
Or if you need feedback on

1419
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:17,617
what you've done so far, it

1420
01:37:17,617 --> 01:37:21,842
can be useful to have draft pull requests

1421
01:37:21,842 --> 01:37:24,425
that are works in progress so

1422
01:37:24,425 --> 01:37:25,346
that you can get that

1423
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:27,648
feedback and people can look and

1424
01:37:27,648 --> 01:37:29,450
see what you have so far.

1425
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:32,273
And that can be very useful.

1426
01:37:32,273 --> 01:37:35,537
And the other issue is that, of course,

1427
01:37:35,537 --> 01:37:37,799
it's important not to commit

1428
01:37:37,799 --> 01:37:42,865
half working code into your tree, obviously.

1429
01:37:45,123 --> 01:37:46,084
Yeah, it's always important

1430
01:37:46,084 --> 01:37:47,546
to communicate with the maintainers

1431
01:37:47,546 --> 01:37:49,488
and the other people in the project

1432
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:50,990
because the last thing you want

1433
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:54,013
to do is to write 5,000 lines of codes

1434
01:37:54,013 --> 01:37:55,254
and then realize that no

1435
01:37:55,254 --> 01:37:56,256
one else is interested or no

1436
01:37:56,256 --> 01:37:57,577
one else actually wants that feature

1437
01:37:57,577 --> 01:37:58,658
or has a different plan.

1438
01:37:58,658 --> 01:38:00,440
So if the reviewer says, okay,

1439
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,282
I want this repository to go

1440
01:38:02,282 --> 01:38:03,864
in a different direction, I'm

1441
01:38:03,864 --> 01:38:04,585
not interested in your

1442
01:38:04,585 --> 01:38:07,028
particular implementation, then it's

1443
01:38:07,028 --> 01:38:08,329
much better to ask in advance

1444
01:38:08,329 --> 01:38:10,071
instead of like working on

1445
01:38:10,071 --> 01:38:12,308
it without telling anyone else.

1446
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:14,276
Also by communicating that way

1447
01:38:14,276 --> 01:38:15,420
you make sure that no one

1448
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,066
else is duplicating your work.

1449
01:38:17,066 --> 01:38:19,194
So you save time as a, as a whole group.

1450
01:38:20,881 --> 01:38:21,222
Yeah.

1451
01:38:22,484 --> 01:38:23,945
- it's that's sorry

1452
01:38:23,945 --> 01:38:26,067
I just that's also why we

1453
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,769
started out this with the creation

1454
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:30,271
of an issue, so that if even before you begin.

1455
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:32,233
- Writing your 5000

1456
01:38:32,233 --> 01:38:34,194
lines of code, you can get feedback

1457
01:38:34,194 --> 01:38:36,036
and not really opening an issue

1458
01:38:36,036 --> 01:38:38,858
to say this is a problem and then going off

1459
01:38:38,858 --> 01:38:41,100
and working to solve it, but

1460
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,602
opening it up and including

1461
01:38:42,602 --> 01:38:43,262
a statement that you're

1462
01:38:43,262 --> 01:38:44,463
planning on approaching.

1463
01:38:44,463 --> 01:38:46,885
The solution

1464
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:47,946
in a particular way, so you

1465
01:38:47,946 --> 01:38:49,548
can get feedback as soon as possible.

1466
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:52,170
Exactly yeah.

1467
01:38:53,062 --> 01:38:53,865
[name], what do you think?

1468
01:38:53,865 --> 01:38:55,009
How large should pull requests

1469
01:38:55,009 --> 01:38:55,631
be on average?

1470
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:01,671
They can be any size.

1471
01:39:02,714 --> 01:39:08,022
They should be cohesive, one unit.

1472
01:39:08,022 --> 01:39:10,866
You don't want to make a

1473
01:39:10,866 --> 01:39:14,952
set of changes that make

1474
01:39:14,952 --> 01:39:16,295
changes in three different places

1475
01:39:16,295 --> 01:39:17,817
in the file and commit

1476
01:39:17,817 --> 01:39:19,620
those all three separately if

1477
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,324
they don't actually function collectively

1478
01:39:22,324 --> 01:39:25,208
as a unit.

1479
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:28,533
For larger code base, yeah.

1480
01:39:28,533 --> 01:39:30,456
Ideally, your commits should

1481
01:39:30,456 --> 01:39:36,885
always leave the branch or in working state.

1482
01:39:38,147 --> 01:39:39,549
It's not always possible, but

1483
01:39:39,549 --> 01:39:40,951
it certainly is an ideal

1484
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:41,873
that you should strive for.

1485
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,378
Yeah, so you should have,

1486
01:39:45,378 --> 01:39:46,239
the better thing is to have

1487
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:48,262
many small pull requests if that's possible.

1488
01:39:48,262 --> 01:39:50,302
Of course, sometimes it's just impossible.

1489
01:39:50,302 --> 01:39:51,845
If you have a very large change

1490
01:39:51,845 --> 01:39:53,168
that needs to be done to the code base,

1491
01:39:53,168 --> 01:39:54,832
but in principle, it's always

1492
01:39:54,832 --> 01:39:55,934
better to have many small

1493
01:39:55,934 --> 01:39:57,858
ones, since it's less work for

1494
01:39:57,858 --> 01:40:00,464
the reviewer to go through 50

1495
01:40:00,464 --> 01:40:01,667
or 100 lines of code and

1496
01:40:01,667 --> 01:40:02,930
understand what's going on than

1497
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,593
going through a major rewrite of

1498
01:40:04,593 --> 01:40:05,275
the whole code base.

1499
01:40:08,021 --> 01:40:10,065
Also,

1500
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:12,471
As you said, we should always

1501
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:14,193
keep the pull requests cohesive in

1502
01:40:14,193 --> 01:40:16,375
a sense of like it's one particular feature

1503
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:17,195
and then it doesn't matter

1504
01:40:17,195 --> 01:40:18,336
whether it's spread over three

1505
01:40:18,336 --> 01:40:19,718
or four different files or

1506
01:40:19,718 --> 01:40:21,039
whether it's just one.

1507
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:21,900
That's much better to have

1508
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,881
like one coherent feature in

1509
01:40:23,881 --> 01:40:24,882
one pull request than having

1510
01:40:24,882 --> 01:40:27,605
like three completely unrelated things

1511
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,306
in one pull request.

1512
01:40:29,306 --> 01:40:31,909
So it's better to keep it that way

1513
01:40:31,909 --> 01:40:34,111
so that you have a, that

1514
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,051
you also make it easier for

1515
01:40:35,051 --> 01:40:36,132
the review of what's going on.

1516
01:40:36,132 --> 01:40:36,733
Like if there are two

1517
01:40:36,733 --> 01:40:37,934
completely separate things from each

1518
01:40:37,934 --> 01:40:39,323
other in a pull request,

1519
01:40:39,323 --> 01:40:44,007
then it's not good practice.

1520
01:40:44,868 --> 01:40:45,729
There were a few other things

1521
01:40:45,729 --> 01:40:46,790
that I wanted to mention

1522
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,591
about good practice for pull requests.

1523
01:40:50,433 --> 01:40:52,035
And one thing we've already

1524
01:40:52,035 --> 01:40:53,896
seen are these automated tests.

1525
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:54,997
So what you should focus on

1526
01:40:54,997 --> 01:40:57,439
as a reviewer is doing things

1527
01:40:57,439 --> 01:40:58,961
that humans are good at and

1528
01:40:58,961 --> 01:41:00,722
not things that can be easily automated.

1529
01:41:01,643 --> 01:41:02,704
So if you, for instance,

1530
01:41:03,765 --> 01:41:05,006
have a particular way how you

1531
01:41:05,006 --> 01:41:07,437
want the code style to look like,

1532
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:09,479
then you can use something called linters,

1533
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:10,260
which is a tool that

1534
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,581
checks whether the code formatting

1535
01:41:11,581 --> 01:41:12,602
is the way you want it to.

1536
01:41:13,743 --> 01:41:14,584
This will be mentioned in

1537
01:41:14,584 --> 01:41:15,545
further detail at a later

1538
01:41:15,545 --> 01:41:17,427
stage, but I'm mentioning this

1539
01:41:17,427 --> 01:41:18,848
in order to pinpoint like you

1540
01:41:18,848 --> 01:41:20,910
as a code reviewer should really

1541
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:22,011
focus on the things that only

1542
01:41:22,011 --> 01:41:22,872
you as a human could do

1543
01:41:22,872 --> 01:41:25,354
that no automation tool can do for you.

1544
01:41:28,798 --> 01:41:29,939
You should also probably merge

1545
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:31,220
as soon as possible since

1546
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:33,642
you want the other collaborators,

1547
01:41:33,642 --> 01:41:35,164
so everyone in your team have

1548
01:41:35,164 --> 01:41:36,715
access to the latest changes.

1549
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:37,496
So you don't want to keep

1550
01:41:37,496 --> 01:41:39,579
that away from everyone for a few months

1551
01:41:39,579 --> 01:41:40,681
and then only merge it once

1552
01:41:40,681 --> 01:41:41,943
it's a hundred percent perfect.

1553
01:41:41,943 --> 01:41:44,086
Like things are never fully perfect.

1554
01:41:44,086 --> 01:41:45,989
It's better to merge as soon as possible

1555
01:41:45,989 --> 01:41:47,010
so that like everyone can

1556
01:41:48,152 --> 01:41:49,434
benefit from the changes that you make.

1557
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:52,158
And also it doesn't really matter

1558
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:53,460
whether the review is done by someone

1559
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:55,082
who is more experienced or not,

1560
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:56,945
because code review is not

1561
01:41:56,945 --> 01:41:58,227
just there to make sure that

1562
01:41:58,227 --> 01:42:00,450
the changes that you do don't

1563
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:01,812
screw up anything in the code.

1564
01:42:01,812 --> 01:42:03,195
They're also there to communicate.

1565
01:42:03,195 --> 01:42:05,338
So if [name] now, for instance,

1566
01:42:05,338 --> 01:42:06,618
as a very senior

1567
01:42:06,618 --> 01:42:08,260
engineer has a brilliant idea

1568
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:09,162
what to implement, then he

1569
01:42:09,162 --> 01:42:10,143
can create a pull request, and

1570
01:42:10,143 --> 01:42:13,428
me, let's say I'm a junior member of the team,

1571
01:42:13,428 --> 01:42:14,689
I'm not as experienced yet,

1572
01:42:14,689 --> 01:42:16,172
I still would learn a lot

1573
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:17,874
from doing the code review, since

1574
01:42:17,874 --> 01:42:19,797
that's a very easy or very

1575
01:42:19,797 --> 01:42:22,340
good way of transferring

1576
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:23,682
information and transferring knowledge.

1577
01:42:24,564 --> 01:42:27,468
Also, the perspective of someone

1578
01:42:27,468 --> 01:42:28,689
who is not as experienced can

1579
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:29,851
also be very important, since

1580
01:42:30,973 --> 01:42:33,076
one quality of code, it's not

1581
01:42:33,076 --> 01:42:34,077
just what it works well,

1582
01:42:35,305 --> 01:42:36,027
I mean, of course it should

1583
01:42:36,027 --> 01:42:37,430
do what it's supposed to do.

1584
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:39,314
It should be hopefully performant

1585
01:42:39,314 --> 01:42:41,418
and so on, but readability is

1586
01:42:41,418 --> 01:42:44,064
also a major criteria for good code.

1587
01:42:44,064 --> 01:42:46,269
So if I, as someone who let's

1588
01:42:46,269 --> 01:42:46,950
say is new to this

1589
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,008
programming language that [name] is using,

1590
01:42:49,008 --> 01:42:50,229
and completely unable to

1591
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:51,571
understand what's happening, then

1592
01:42:51,571 --> 01:42:53,714
maybe that's on one hand the side

1593
01:42:53,714 --> 01:42:55,075
that I'm not particularly experienced

1594
01:42:55,075 --> 01:42:56,137
and I should learn more, but

1595
01:42:56,137 --> 01:42:57,178
it could also be a sign that

1596
01:42:57,178 --> 01:42:58,499
maybe the code is written in such a way

1597
01:42:58,499 --> 01:43:00,302
that it's very overcomplicated

1598
01:43:00,302 --> 01:43:01,563
and it could be written in

1599
01:43:01,563 --> 01:43:02,444
an easier way, which is

1600
01:43:02,444 --> 01:43:04,507
then better for everyone who

1601
01:43:04,507 --> 01:43:05,928
works with the code and also for new users.

1602
01:43:06,729 --> 01:43:09,733
So the perspective of like

1603
01:43:09,733 --> 01:43:10,794
a diverse team of different

1604
01:43:10,794 --> 01:43:11,655
people with different levels of

1605
01:43:11,655 --> 01:43:13,197
experience can be very valuable.

1606
01:43:13,197 --> 01:43:14,879
So there's no reason to assume

1607
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:15,920
that code reviews can only

1608
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,222
be done by senior people

1609
01:43:17,222 --> 01:43:18,103
who are very experienced.

1610
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:21,081
Is there anything else, [name],

1611
01:43:21,081 --> 01:43:22,362
that we should mention before we

1612
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:23,804
go back to the material?

1613
01:43:26,066 --> 01:43:27,667
I think that's most of it.

1614
01:43:29,689 --> 01:43:30,010
Okay.

1615
01:43:31,591 --> 01:43:34,994
So in that case, let's go

1616
01:43:34,994 --> 01:43:37,937
now to the next section.

1617
01:43:37,937 --> 01:43:43,782
So I'm here, the material of the lesson.

1618
01:43:43,782 --> 01:43:44,843
So I just scroll to the bottom.

1619
01:43:46,325 --> 01:43:47,486
We have discussed protected

1620
01:43:47,486 --> 01:43:48,647
branches already.

1621
01:43:50,534 --> 01:43:51,955
And then we have here a quick summary.

1622
01:43:53,056 --> 01:43:54,338
Let's just quickly have a look

1623
01:43:54,338 --> 01:43:55,499
whether there are any questions

1624
01:43:55,499 --> 01:43:59,002
in the markdown document that

1625
01:43:59,002 --> 01:44:00,123
we could answer now, which

1626
01:44:00,123 --> 01:44:02,486
are still connected to this topic.

1627
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:03,206
Let's see.

1628
01:44:03,206 --> 01:44:04,187
I'm just going here to the

1629
01:44:04,187 --> 01:44:05,248
end of this document.

1630
01:44:08,351 --> 01:44:09,372
I see that there are already

1631
01:44:09,372 --> 01:44:10,554
a lot of answers there.

1632
01:44:13,236 --> 01:44:14,878
Any recommendations of using Copilot?

1633
01:44:16,099 --> 01:44:17,200
Okay, that's a good question.

1634
01:44:19,525 --> 01:44:20,186
[name], do you want to

1635
01:44:20,186 --> 01:44:21,388
share your thoughts on this?

1636
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:23,591
I will pass to you.

1637
01:44:25,473 --> 01:44:28,217
Okay.

1638
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:31,582
So personally, that's not

1639
01:44:31,582 --> 01:44:32,743
my personal opinion.

1640
01:44:32,743 --> 01:44:34,586
So take that with a pinch of salt.

1641
01:44:34,586 --> 01:44:35,607
I think it can be very

1642
01:44:35,607 --> 01:44:39,813
useful to use Copilot if you're familiar with,

1643
01:44:40,635 --> 01:44:42,177
if you can decipher what

1644
01:44:42,177 --> 01:44:45,642
the code that Copilot spits out does.

1645
01:44:45,642 --> 01:44:47,204
So if you're already experienced

1646
01:44:47,204 --> 01:44:48,500
in your programming language,

1647
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,682
and you can understand everything

1648
01:44:49,682 --> 01:44:50,463
that Copilot does, then I

1649
01:44:50,463 --> 01:44:53,667
think it's a great tool that

1650
01:44:53,667 --> 01:44:55,209
can make you much more productive.

1651
01:44:56,611 --> 01:44:57,913
However, you should always remember

1652
01:44:57,913 --> 01:44:59,835
that you still have the

1653
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:01,798
responsibility for the code.

1654
01:45:01,798 --> 01:45:02,639
Copilot doesn't take this

1655
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:03,480
responsibility away.

1656
01:45:04,442 --> 01:45:06,384
So if you are unsure

1657
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:09,128
whether what Copilot does makes

1658
01:45:09,128 --> 01:45:10,770
sense, then that's maybe a

1659
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:13,153
sign that you shouldn't fully rely on it.

1660
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:13,734
And you should always

1661
01:45:13,734 --> 01:45:17,002
check yourself whether

1662
01:45:17,002 --> 01:45:18,164
What are the changes that

1663
01:45:18,164 --> 01:45:19,326
couplet suggests make sense?

1664
01:45:19,326 --> 01:45:20,087
I mean, that's the case for

1665
01:45:20,087 --> 01:45:20,908
any AI tool, really.

1666
01:45:23,132 --> 01:45:24,654
So I would encourage you to

1667
01:45:24,654 --> 01:45:29,322
use it, but always don't become too complacent.

1668
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:33,568
Always try to always understand

1669
01:45:33,568 --> 01:45:34,830
what couplet does, whether that

1670
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:36,577
makes any sense for your quick base.

1671
01:45:36,577 --> 01:45:37,518
Yeah.

1672
01:45:37,518 --> 01:45:39,861
I was just going to say

1673
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:42,264
that it's very important to

1674
01:45:42,264 --> 01:45:44,848
understand the code, not rely on

1675
01:45:44,848 --> 01:45:47,812
does it give me an error when I run it.

1676
01:45:47,812 --> 01:45:48,492
If it doesn't give me

1677
01:45:48,492 --> 01:45:49,193
an error, that doesn't mean

1678
01:45:49,193 --> 01:45:51,056
the code is correct.

1679
01:45:52,077 --> 01:45:55,702
So you have to be very careful about,

1680
01:45:55,702 --> 01:45:57,624
particularly with more extensive

1681
01:45:57,624 --> 01:46:01,349
amounts of code being provided.

1682
01:46:01,349 --> 01:46:04,574
it's very critical because particularly

1683
01:46:04,574 --> 01:46:05,535
if you're working with anything

1684
01:46:05,535 --> 01:46:06,857
that has the potential for

1685
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:10,763
resulting in erroneous results

1686
01:46:10,763 --> 01:46:12,646
or potential for security

1687
01:46:12,646 --> 01:46:15,651
implications, those are all things

1688
01:46:15,651 --> 01:46:17,534
where it's particularly important

1689
01:46:17,534 --> 01:46:18,796
to be very careful in

1690
01:46:18,796 --> 01:46:21,620
reviewing AI generated code.

1691
01:46:24,865 --> 01:46:27,329
Okay.

1692
01:46:27,329 --> 01:46:30,425
Yes, so someone has posted a question

1693
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:32,648
probably a very good resource

1694
01:46:32,648 --> 01:46:33,449
that you can read up on.

1695
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:35,352
Let's see, there's another question.

1696
01:46:35,352 --> 01:46:37,755
In the exercise, we created a branch.

1697
01:46:37,755 --> 01:46:39,277
Does modifying a file work the

1698
01:46:39,277 --> 01:46:41,380
same way of pull requests?

1699
01:46:42,682 --> 01:46:45,686
Yeah, so if you remember from the lecture,

1700
01:46:45,686 --> 01:46:46,747
pull requests, they're always

1701
01:46:46,747 --> 01:46:48,410
from one branch to another branch.

1702
01:46:50,172 --> 01:46:54,138
So if you would contribute

1703
01:46:54,138 --> 01:46:56,321
directly, let's say if you

1704
01:46:56,321 --> 01:46:58,103
push something directly from your

1705
01:46:58,103 --> 01:47:00,142
main branch locally to the main branch,

1706
01:47:00,142 --> 01:47:01,063
on GitHub, or if you

1707
01:47:01,063 --> 01:47:02,245
just change something directly on

1708
01:47:02,245 --> 01:47:04,088
GitHub, it is not a pull request.

1709
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:06,691
Pull requests always work from

1710
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:07,693
one branch to another branch.

1711
01:47:10,417 --> 01:47:11,138
So let's see, does that

1712
01:47:11,138 --> 01:47:12,319
answer the question, does modifying

1713
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:14,743
a file work the same way for pull requests?

1714
01:47:14,743 --> 01:47:16,005
Yeah, so if you then change

1715
01:47:16,005 --> 01:47:19,309
the file in one pull request, then, sorry,

1716
01:47:19,309 --> 01:47:20,932
in one branch that is connected

1717
01:47:20,932 --> 01:47:22,294
by a pull request, then it

1718
01:47:22,294 --> 01:47:23,836
will update the pull request automatically.

1719
01:47:24,717 --> 01:47:25,478
So that's maybe something

1720
01:47:25,478 --> 01:47:26,600
we haven't explicitly mentioned,

1721
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,601
but how would we deal

1722
01:47:27,601 --> 01:47:29,740
with a situation where we are,

1723
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:31,783
I'm happy with some changes, right?

1724
01:47:32,624 --> 01:47:37,850
So I'll open the repository again.

1725
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:43,016
And I will now use

1726
01:47:43,016 --> 01:47:44,498
again this adding Periani recipe.

1727
01:47:47,542 --> 01:47:49,244
We can see here that's a

1728
01:47:49,244 --> 01:47:54,350
pull request from Bergen to Maine.

1729
01:47:55,832 --> 01:47:57,895
And we saw that particular

1730
01:47:57,895 --> 01:47:59,697
pull request had the issue that

1731
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:04,377
the tests failed because there

1732
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:06,420
was this Unicode character which

1733
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,663
our automated tested capsule

1734
01:48:08,663 --> 01:48:09,484
were unprepared for.

1735
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:11,547
So what we did here was

1736
01:48:11,547 --> 01:48:13,790
to change the file in this branch.

1737
01:48:15,012 --> 01:48:17,916
I suggested here, let us show the change.

1738
01:48:17,916 --> 01:48:18,838
What I suggested here is

1739
01:48:18,838 --> 01:48:21,321
to remove this character so

1740
01:48:21,321 --> 01:48:24,266
that we have ingredients here

1741
01:48:24,266 --> 01:48:25,507
written only like that without

1742
01:48:25,507 --> 01:48:27,217
a Unicode character.

1743
01:48:27,217 --> 01:48:29,299
And this was then committed.

1744
01:48:29,299 --> 01:48:30,220
So if you see here, I

1745
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,202
made a commit, which is, you can

1746
01:48:32,202 --> 01:48:33,023
have a look at this commit.

1747
01:48:35,045 --> 01:48:36,867
So I changed here this line.

1748
01:48:36,867 --> 01:48:37,868
I removed just this character.

1749
01:48:39,309 --> 01:48:40,771
And this now updates the branch.

1750
01:48:42,032 --> 01:48:43,413
And by updating the branch,

1751
01:48:43,413 --> 01:48:44,294
which is connected by a

1752
01:48:44,294 --> 01:48:46,897
pull request, it automatically updates

1753
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:48,518
the pull request as well.

1754
01:48:48,518 --> 01:48:49,960
And then the tests will run again.

1755
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,022
And in this case, they passed.

1756
01:48:52,022 --> 01:48:53,283
So in theory, now we see

1757
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:54,304
that all checks have passed.

1758
01:48:55,516 --> 01:48:56,617
And we see that someone

1759
01:48:56,617 --> 01:48:58,179
had, okay, we actually didn't

1760
01:48:58,179 --> 01:48:59,601
do a formal review.

1761
01:48:59,601 --> 01:49:00,802
So let's do it quickly.

1762
01:49:00,802 --> 01:49:01,223
Let's go up.

1763
01:49:02,464 --> 01:49:03,505
And it already has this pop

1764
01:49:03,505 --> 01:49:05,147
up here asking me to do a review.

1765
01:49:05,147 --> 01:49:05,888
So I'm going to click on it.

1766
01:49:09,192 --> 01:49:09,492
Okay.

1767
01:49:10,313 --> 01:49:11,234
I'll have one last look.

1768
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:16,720
Okay.

1769
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,601
That looks all good.

1770
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,748
Ah.

1771
01:49:23,748 --> 01:49:24,409
Okay.

1772
01:49:24,409 --> 01:49:25,410
So I can give some additional

1773
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:26,552
comments if I want to, I can say.

1774
01:49:33,862 --> 01:49:34,162
I don't know.

1775
01:49:34,162 --> 01:49:35,204
Let me make sure I don't

1776
01:49:35,204 --> 01:49:36,125
make any spelling mistakes.

1777
01:49:37,347 --> 01:49:38,188
Let's just start to review.

1778
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:40,150
Okay.

1779
01:49:41,592 --> 01:49:42,333
Let's see if there's anything

1780
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:44,657
else that needs special attention.

1781
01:49:44,657 --> 01:49:46,439
It looks all good.

1782
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:47,040
Even tips.

1783
01:49:47,901 --> 01:49:48,642
That's very helpful.

1784
01:49:54,325 --> 01:49:55,827
quickly add review comment, okay?

1785
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:00,072
Okay, so let's go up and

1786
01:50:00,072 --> 01:50:01,474
we can finish your review.

1787
01:50:01,474 --> 01:50:02,215
We can click on it and

1788
01:50:02,215 --> 01:50:04,437
I can approve it now.

1789
01:50:04,437 --> 01:50:05,959
So I'm gonna now submit the review.

1790
01:50:10,284 --> 01:50:10,945
And we can merge it.

1791
01:50:19,596 --> 01:50:20,597
Okay, let's see, are there

1792
01:50:20,597 --> 01:50:22,459
any other questions in the document?

1793
01:50:24,886 --> 01:50:26,087
I hope that this question

1794
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:27,809
is answered, number 20.

1795
01:50:27,809 --> 01:50:30,131
So let's go back to the material.

1796
01:50:31,172 --> 01:50:31,913
I'll just bring it up again.

1797
01:50:34,896 --> 01:50:35,717
We now go to the next

1798
01:50:35,717 --> 01:50:38,359
page, and we now start with the next exercise.

1799
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:39,220
So this will be the last

1800
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:40,882
thing we do before we go into the lunch break.

1801
01:50:42,784 --> 01:50:44,546
We will now basically focus

1802
01:50:44,546 --> 01:50:45,527
on the code review process.

1803
01:50:46,367 --> 01:50:51,012
So a lot of it is repetition.

1804
01:50:55,193 --> 01:50:56,335
Just to focus this time is

1805
01:50:56,335 --> 01:50:57,656
now on the creating the

1806
01:50:57,656 --> 01:51:00,280
pull request and suggesting changes to it.

1807
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,622
So we've already shown most

1808
01:51:01,622 --> 01:51:05,347
of these steps here during the stream,

1809
01:51:05,347 --> 01:51:06,208
but I will ask you

1810
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:11,375
now to create additional, let's

1811
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:12,917
see how many pull requests we have.

1812
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:14,680
If we don't have enough, we

1813
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,342
might need to make a few more pull requests.

1814
01:51:16,342 --> 01:51:17,824
Let me just take this down.

1815
01:51:17,824 --> 01:51:18,705
No, sorry, how do I?

1816
01:51:19,827 --> 01:51:22,971
Okay, let's go to the number

1817
01:51:22,971 --> 01:51:24,843
of issues and pull requests

1818
01:51:24,843 --> 01:51:26,405
Okay.

1819
01:51:26,405 --> 01:51:27,386
So for this exercise, we'll

1820
01:51:27,386 --> 01:51:28,727
ask you to create a pull request again,

1821
01:51:28,727 --> 01:51:29,749
and now then go through

1822
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:31,450
the review process here, which is mentioned.

1823
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:34,554
So I just screwed up my

1824
01:51:34,554 --> 01:51:35,455
screen share a little bit.

1825
01:51:35,455 --> 01:51:36,436
Let's open the other window.

1826
01:51:38,899 --> 01:51:39,139
Okay.

1827
01:51:40,841 --> 01:51:42,202
Okay, so all the, what you

1828
01:51:42,202 --> 01:51:44,665
need to do is describe here exercise number two.

1829
01:51:44,665 --> 01:51:47,669
As I said, focus on the review button,

1830
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:49,651
on the review function, use

1831
01:51:49,651 --> 01:51:54,276
this plus minus button to suggest changes, and

1832
01:51:55,201 --> 01:51:56,583
Otherwise, I think it's mainly

1833
01:51:56,583 --> 01:51:57,043
the same thing.

1834
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,445
So now you can practice doing code reviews.

1835
01:51:59,506 --> 01:52:03,870
And I think we give you roughly 25 minutes.

1836
01:52:03,870 --> 01:52:06,273
So we would then finish

1837
01:52:06,273 --> 01:52:09,997
at Central European time, that would be 12.58.

1838
01:52:09,997 --> 01:52:12,540
I will then just quickly say

1839
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:13,521
a few words before we then

1840
01:52:13,521 --> 01:52:14,342
go into the lunch break.

1841
01:52:15,283 --> 01:52:16,724
So with that said, good

1842
01:52:16,724 --> 01:52:19,387
luck with the exercise and see

1843
01:52:19,387 --> 01:52:20,689
you in 25 minutes.

1844
01:52:20,689 --> 01:52:20,989
Bye.

1845
02:16:24,254 --> 02:16:25,516
Okay, welcome back from

1846
02:16:25,516 --> 02:16:26,377
exercise number two.

1847
02:16:27,699 --> 02:16:29,442
We are almost at the lunch break,

1848
02:16:29,442 --> 02:16:31,305
but let me just use the

1849
02:16:31,305 --> 02:16:32,767
remaining time to quickly discuss

1850
02:16:32,767 --> 02:16:33,829
one question which appeared here

1851
02:16:33,829 --> 02:16:34,810
in the collaborative document.

1852
02:16:35,832 --> 02:16:38,155
And that is here, one

1853
02:16:38,155 --> 02:16:39,818
participant has a hard time to

1854
02:16:39,818 --> 02:16:40,939
find a plus and minus symbol.

1855
02:16:40,939 --> 02:16:43,023
So let me quickly show where

1856
02:16:43,023 --> 02:16:44,224
you can find that by creating

1857
02:16:44,224 --> 02:16:46,207
a pull request or doing a readme.

1858
02:16:47,249 --> 02:16:48,992
So I'm now again at the

1859
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:50,033
same repository as before.

1860
02:16:50,033 --> 02:16:51,475
And now let me just pick

1861
02:16:51,475 --> 02:16:53,198
one of the pull requests here.

1862
02:16:54,022 --> 02:16:56,245
I go again to files changed to see

1863
02:16:56,245 --> 02:16:57,287
what the code actually looks

1864
02:16:57,287 --> 02:16:58,108
like that has been changed.

1865
02:16:59,770 --> 02:17:01,673
And now, in this case, I

1866
02:17:01,673 --> 02:17:03,876
can click on this blue plus sign.

1867
02:17:09,003 --> 02:17:10,685
And let's see.

1868
02:17:15,072 --> 02:17:15,733
That's interesting.

1869
02:17:15,733 --> 02:17:17,375
It doesn't show it to me right now.

1870
02:17:17,375 --> 02:17:17,976
That's strange.

1871
02:17:19,638 --> 02:17:20,499
Let me try a different one.

1872
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:22,442
That should not be the case.

1873
02:17:25,274 --> 02:17:25,975
It's changed.

1874
02:17:27,277 --> 02:17:28,619
I click on the sign.

1875
02:17:28,619 --> 02:17:29,179
Ah, and here it is.

1876
02:17:30,661 --> 02:17:31,523
Actually, I don't know why

1877
02:17:31,523 --> 02:17:32,985
it didn't show previously.

1878
02:17:32,985 --> 02:17:34,527
Does anyone else know who's in the call?

1879
02:17:41,837 --> 02:17:42,518
I guess that's a no.

1880
02:17:43,319 --> 02:17:44,861
But what we need is this

1881
02:17:44,861 --> 02:17:46,203
Add a Suggestion tab.

1882
02:17:46,203 --> 02:17:46,743
So I click on it.

1883
02:17:48,045 --> 02:17:51,009
And now it displays this one line.

1884
02:17:52,071 --> 02:17:53,032
And then here's suggestions.

1885
02:17:53,032 --> 02:17:55,143
So if I make changes here, let's say

1886
02:17:55,143 --> 02:17:56,024
Okay, what is that actually?

1887
02:17:56,024 --> 02:17:57,846
That's 500,000 avocados might

1888
02:17:57,846 --> 02:17:59,748
be slightly too many.

1889
02:17:59,748 --> 02:18:01,831
So let's reduce it to 50,000.

1890
02:18:01,831 --> 02:18:02,511
I believe that's enough.

1891
02:18:03,312 --> 02:18:05,575
Then I can do up a single comment.

1892
02:18:15,806 --> 02:18:17,028
Now, if I go to

1893
02:18:17,028 --> 02:18:19,851
conversation, I scroll down.

1894
02:18:21,535 --> 02:18:24,298
And now it just suggests a change,

1895
02:18:24,298 --> 02:18:25,900
but also it does it twice

1896
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:27,842
for some reason, I guess I misclicked.

1897
02:18:27,842 --> 02:18:29,264
But if I now click to

1898
02:18:29,264 --> 02:18:32,988
commit suggestion, I can make

1899
02:18:32,988 --> 02:18:34,209
this commit automatically.

1900
02:18:34,209 --> 02:18:35,090
So now I create an

1901
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:37,253
additional commit without the person

1902
02:18:37,253 --> 02:18:39,956
having to actually do it themselves.

1903
02:18:39,956 --> 02:18:41,878
So that way we can suggest

1904
02:18:41,878 --> 02:18:43,319
changes to the code automatically

1905
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:46,963
as a reviewer, and we can also merge it

1906
02:18:46,963 --> 02:18:48,125
if the person who creates

1907
02:18:48,125 --> 02:18:50,427
the pull request enables that, which

1908
02:18:50,427 --> 02:18:51,188
is done by default.

1909
02:18:52,062 --> 02:18:52,843
So this makes it much

1910
02:18:52,843 --> 02:18:54,044
faster to suggest changes to

1911
02:18:54,044 --> 02:18:57,989
the code than doing it back and forth.

1912
02:18:57,989 --> 02:18:59,371
If you're telling the person

1913
02:18:59,371 --> 02:19:00,412
who created the progress what to

1914
02:19:00,412 --> 02:19:02,034
do, then that person has to do it.

1915
02:19:02,034 --> 02:19:02,955
You can just create it right

1916
02:19:02,955 --> 02:19:04,017
away with this plus minus sign.

1917
02:19:05,598 --> 02:19:06,500
I am a bit surprised that

1918
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:07,981
I didn't see it the first time I clicked on it.

1919
02:19:07,981 --> 02:19:08,943
So I'm not entirely sure

1920
02:19:08,943 --> 02:19:10,344
whether that's because I'm zoomed

1921
02:19:10,344 --> 02:19:11,145
in so far again.

1922
02:19:11,145 --> 02:19:15,150
[name], have you encountered this before?

1923
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:17,253
I don't remember ever not seeing this.

1924
02:19:17,253 --> 02:19:17,493
Okay.

1925
02:19:18,995 --> 02:19:20,256
So this is strange, but

1926
02:19:20,256 --> 02:19:22,032
thank you for noticing.

1927
02:19:22,032 --> 02:19:23,393
We just, I'll try another one

1928
02:19:23,393 --> 02:19:25,215
just to see whether this

1929
02:19:25,215 --> 02:19:26,776
is a reoccurring theme.

1930
02:19:28,078 --> 02:19:29,679
So we see here different pull requests.

1931
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:30,900
I click on fast changed

1932
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:35,004
500 gram of chicken.

1933
02:19:35,004 --> 02:19:36,706
Okay, let's say we want to

1934
02:19:36,706 --> 02:19:37,406
make a change here.

1935
02:19:37,406 --> 02:19:38,648
And I say we want to have

1936
02:19:38,648 --> 02:19:41,971
700 grams, add a single comment.

1937
02:19:43,752 --> 02:19:46,195
And now it appears here.

1938
02:19:46,195 --> 02:19:47,916
So I can commit it directly here

1939
02:19:47,916 --> 02:19:48,937
if I want to create a

1940
02:19:48,937 --> 02:19:52,019
commit by add these changes to the,

1941
02:19:52,019 --> 02:19:52,520
request.

1942
02:19:53,902 --> 02:19:55,844
Or I can also do it in conversation.

1943
02:19:55,844 --> 02:19:56,906
It appears in both places.

1944
02:19:59,789 --> 02:20:01,231
And yeah, I can then commit if I want.

1945
02:20:02,053 --> 02:20:03,114
But I'll leave that now for

1946
02:20:03,114 --> 02:20:06,018
the person who created the pull request.

1947
02:20:06,018 --> 02:20:07,139
I hope that answers the question.

1948
02:20:12,166 --> 02:20:13,588
There are some other questions.

1949
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:18,963
Yes, so pull requests, this

1950
02:20:18,963 --> 02:20:21,366
feature is also available on GitLab.

1951
02:20:21,366 --> 02:20:22,688
So for those of you who

1952
02:20:22,688 --> 02:20:23,589
are not familiar with GitLab,

1953
02:20:23,589 --> 02:20:24,791
GitLab is basically an alternative

1954
02:20:24,791 --> 02:20:25,592
platform to GitHub.

1955
02:20:27,074 --> 02:20:28,877
It is not owned by Microsoft,

1956
02:20:28,877 --> 02:20:30,079
but you can host your

1957
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:31,501
own GitLab instance if you want.

1958
02:20:31,501 --> 02:20:33,924
So it's a kind of a free version.

1959
02:20:33,924 --> 02:20:35,526
But some of the functionalities

1960
02:20:35,526 --> 02:20:36,428
that GitHub provides are

1961
02:20:36,428 --> 02:20:38,350
not automatically enabled in GitLab.

1962
02:20:38,350 --> 02:20:39,051
But you can think of it

1963
02:20:39,051 --> 02:20:41,635
just as a different option instead of GitHub.

1964
02:20:43,066 --> 02:20:44,749
The strange or funny thing is

1965
02:20:44,749 --> 02:20:46,311
that GitLab calls pull

1966
02:20:46,311 --> 02:20:48,294
requests, merge requests, but

1967
02:20:48,294 --> 02:20:49,416
they're exactly the same thing.

1968
02:20:49,416 --> 02:20:52,400
They just have a different name.

1969
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:53,261
So all the concepts that

1970
02:20:53,261 --> 02:20:55,264
you've learned today in the last two days,

1971
02:20:55,264 --> 02:20:56,246
they are also applicable if

1972
02:20:56,246 --> 02:20:57,628
you use a slightly different

1973
02:20:57,628 --> 02:20:58,950
stack in the future.

1974
02:20:58,950 --> 02:21:00,652
So like there's maybe the

1975
02:21:00,652 --> 02:21:01,754
names change, but in principle,

1976
02:21:01,754 --> 02:21:02,375
it's the same idea.

1977
02:21:03,517 --> 02:21:03,677
Okay.

1978
02:21:03,677 --> 02:21:05,019
I see we have two minutes over time.

1979
02:21:05,019 --> 02:21:07,082
So, um,

1980
02:21:08,362 --> 02:21:10,224
Let's go into the lunch break.

1981
02:21:10,224 --> 02:21:11,806
So here in central Europe,

1982
02:21:11,806 --> 02:21:14,069
that would be from right now

1983
02:21:14,069 --> 02:21:15,631
until 2 o'clock, so 14.00.

1984
02:21:17,654 --> 02:21:20,698
If you are in other parts of Europe

1985
02:21:20,698 --> 02:21:21,318
or somewhere else in the

1986
02:21:21,318 --> 02:21:22,660
world, then you can, I

1987
02:21:22,660 --> 02:21:24,622
guess, easily calculate when we are back.

1988
02:21:24,622 --> 02:21:26,004
So we are back in 57 minutes.

1989
02:21:27,226 --> 02:21:28,327
And we will then go for

1990
02:21:28,327 --> 02:21:32,032
the last part of the material today,

1991
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,693
where we then go for

1992
02:21:32,693 --> 02:21:37,640
the third exercise that we'll focus on.

1993
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:39,268
creating pull requests from

1994
02:21:39,268 --> 02:21:40,292
forked repositories.

1995
02:21:41,458 --> 02:21:42,442
So have a nice lunch break

1996
02:21:42,442 --> 02:21:44,472
and see you then in 57 minutes.

1997
02:21:44,472 --> 02:21:44,713
Bye.

1998
03:18:23,352 --> 03:18:24,654
Okay, welcome back, everyone.

1999
03:18:24,654 --> 03:18:26,477
I hope you have a nice lunch break.

2000
03:18:27,499 --> 03:18:28,801
We are now in the last

2001
03:18:28,801 --> 03:18:30,664
section of today's workshop.

2002
03:18:30,664 --> 03:18:32,186
So we will now discuss how

2003
03:18:32,186 --> 03:18:34,550
to work with repositories where

2004
03:18:34,550 --> 03:18:36,313
you don't have access to them

2005
03:18:36,313 --> 03:18:37,875
or write access to them.

2006
03:18:37,875 --> 03:18:38,897
But we will now show how

2007
03:18:38,897 --> 03:18:40,459
you can work with them.

2008
03:18:40,459 --> 03:18:41,581
You can even contribute to them,

2009
03:18:41,581 --> 03:18:42,503
even if you're not part

2010
03:18:42,503 --> 03:18:45,007
of the original organization that

2011
03:18:45,007 --> 03:18:46,188
created the repository.

2012
03:18:46,188 --> 03:18:47,531
It can be a complete outsider

2013
03:18:47,531 --> 03:18:48,592
and still pay for requests.

2014
03:18:48,592 --> 03:18:49,714
And we'll show you how to do that now.

2015
03:18:50,538 --> 03:18:53,342
And before we go to the last bit, however,

2016
03:18:53,342 --> 03:18:56,005
let me just quickly kind of show at

2017
03:18:56,005 --> 03:18:57,006
what stage we have now

2018
03:18:57,006 --> 03:18:59,770
the repository from the previous exercise.

2019
03:18:59,770 --> 03:19:00,611
So you can see there have been

2020
03:19:00,611 --> 03:19:01,812
a lot of new issues and

2021
03:19:01,812 --> 03:19:03,654
pull requests, which is really nice.

2022
03:19:03,654 --> 03:19:06,558
We can have a look here at the history.

2023
03:19:06,558 --> 03:19:09,302
I can see all the last commits

2024
03:19:09,302 --> 03:19:09,902
and you can see there's a

2025
03:19:09,902 --> 03:19:11,604
bunch of new pull requests

2026
03:19:11,604 --> 03:19:12,746
that have been merged.

2027
03:19:12,746 --> 03:19:13,587
Thank you all for doing that.

2028
03:19:14,728 --> 03:19:15,569
And one thing which is

2029
03:19:15,569 --> 03:19:16,551
quite interesting, we can go

2030
03:19:16,551 --> 03:19:17,972
here to the settings or here

2031
03:19:17,972 --> 03:19:20,055
on these three dots and then click on insights.

2032
03:19:21,537 --> 03:19:22,298
And then if you click on

2033
03:19:22,298 --> 03:19:24,340
network, it shows us all

2034
03:19:24,340 --> 03:19:26,241
the different branches that people

2035
03:19:26,241 --> 03:19:28,083
have been working on and

2036
03:19:28,083 --> 03:19:28,764
that have been merged.

2037
03:19:29,665 --> 03:19:32,247
So here, you can scroll

2038
03:19:32,247 --> 03:19:32,888
back to the beginning.

2039
03:19:37,992 --> 03:19:39,554
So here, September 9th, and

2040
03:19:39,554 --> 03:19:42,997
I originally created this repository

2041
03:19:42,997 --> 03:19:44,819
based on the templates that was shown earlier.

2042
03:19:44,819 --> 03:19:45,539
We can now see all

2043
03:19:45,539 --> 03:19:46,560
the different branches that I've

2044
03:19:46,560 --> 03:19:48,042
created, and we can see that

2045
03:19:48,042 --> 03:19:49,223
many of them have been merged.

2046
03:19:49,223 --> 03:19:50,464
So here, for instance,

2047
03:19:51,355 --> 03:19:53,637
merged pull request from this user.

2048
03:19:53,637 --> 03:19:54,838
And you can see here, some

2049
03:19:54,838 --> 03:19:56,319
of them have not been merged, just a little bit.

2050
03:19:59,803 --> 03:20:01,564
And this gives us a really good overview.

2051
03:20:01,564 --> 03:20:02,165
So if you have a very

2052
03:20:02,165 --> 03:20:03,706
complex structure of a repository,

2053
03:20:03,706 --> 03:20:05,188
then you can always use these

2054
03:20:05,188 --> 03:20:06,709
network graphs in order to

2055
03:20:06,709 --> 03:20:07,810
get a better overview of how

2056
03:20:07,810 --> 03:20:09,071
many branches are at the

2057
03:20:09,071 --> 03:20:10,152
moment, how many people are working

2058
03:20:10,152 --> 03:20:11,533
on it and so on.

2059
03:20:11,533 --> 03:20:14,036
And we already see here a new owner.

2060
03:20:14,036 --> 03:20:14,976
So that's kind of a hint

2061
03:20:14,976 --> 03:20:16,378
to the exercise we do now.

2062
03:20:16,378 --> 03:20:19,604
And that's now to fork

2063
03:20:19,604 --> 03:20:21,788
repositories and faithful requests

2064
03:20:21,788 --> 03:20:22,830
from four repositories to

2065
03:20:22,830 --> 03:20:23,731
the upstream repository.

2066
03:20:24,673 --> 03:20:27,919
So let us go back to the lecture material.

2067
03:20:27,919 --> 03:20:29,502
So we are now back here and

2068
03:20:29,502 --> 03:20:30,684
we are now in the last section.

2069
03:20:30,684 --> 03:20:32,848
So this is the, how

2070
03:20:32,848 --> 03:20:33,690
to contribute changes to

2071
03:20:33,690 --> 03:20:35,092
repositories that belong to other users.

2072
03:20:35,914 --> 03:20:36,475
Let's open that.

2073
03:20:40,802 --> 03:20:41,123
Okay.

2074
03:20:43,111 --> 03:20:44,313
So we will now introduce

2075
03:20:44,313 --> 03:20:45,515
the third exercise, and then

2076
03:20:45,515 --> 03:20:46,797
[name] will basically show the

2077
03:20:46,797 --> 03:20:48,679
most important steps before we then

2078
03:20:48,679 --> 03:20:51,103
let you do the exercise again.

2079
03:20:52,926 --> 03:20:54,288
So as I already hinted, we

2080
03:20:54,288 --> 03:20:55,169
are now in a situation where

2081
03:20:55,169 --> 03:20:56,351
we want to contribute changes

2082
03:20:56,351 --> 03:20:58,695
to a repository that belongs to someone else.

2083
03:20:58,695 --> 03:20:59,816
It doesn't have to be someone we know.

2084
03:20:59,816 --> 03:21:00,798
It could be also like

2085
03:21:00,798 --> 03:21:01,839
a large repository from

2086
03:21:01,839 --> 03:21:04,023
a different organization.

2087
03:21:04,023 --> 03:21:06,246
So let's use NumPy again as an example.

2088
03:21:06,246 --> 03:21:07,227
So let's say you have found

2089
03:21:07,227 --> 03:21:08,890
a bug in NumPy, and you also

2090
03:21:08,890 --> 03:21:10,499
happen to know how to fix it.

2091
03:21:10,499 --> 03:21:11,681
So again, NumPy is this

2092
03:21:11,681 --> 03:21:13,424
very famous Python library that

2093
03:21:13,424 --> 03:21:14,325
probably many of you use.

2094
03:21:15,767 --> 03:21:17,009
Then you wouldn't be in

2095
03:21:17,009 --> 03:21:19,153
the NumPy core team, most likely.

2096
03:21:19,153 --> 03:21:19,954
I would be very surprised

2097
03:21:19,954 --> 03:21:22,498
if all team members would take this course.

2098
03:21:25,202 --> 03:21:26,324
So probably what you would have

2099
03:21:26,324 --> 03:21:27,045
to do in order to make

2100
03:21:27,045 --> 03:21:28,207
contributions is to fork the

2101
03:21:28,207 --> 03:21:29,449
repository and then create a

2102
03:21:29,449 --> 03:21:30,250
pull request from there.

2103
03:21:33,695 --> 03:21:34,917
So before we start with

2104
03:21:34,917 --> 03:21:36,239
the exercise, I'll just quickly

2105
03:21:36,239 --> 03:21:38,005
start on the bookkeeping again.

2106
03:21:38,005 --> 03:21:40,769
we will now use a different repository.

2107
03:21:40,769 --> 03:21:44,234
So we will start with the same template.

2108
03:21:44,234 --> 03:21:46,237
And if you are now a group leader

2109
03:21:46,237 --> 03:21:49,642
who is working with a

2110
03:21:49,642 --> 03:21:51,245
small group of participants of

2111
03:21:51,245 --> 03:21:53,969
this course locally, you can

2112
03:21:53,969 --> 03:21:55,651
generate a new template.

2113
03:21:55,651 --> 03:21:56,693
And the difference to the

2114
03:21:56,693 --> 03:21:57,814
previous case is that you now

2115
03:21:57,814 --> 03:22:01,023
do not have to add any collaborators.

2116
03:22:01,023 --> 03:22:02,225
because now people will fork

2117
03:22:02,225 --> 03:22:04,508
it and will contribute that way.

2118
03:22:04,508 --> 03:22:06,932
So there's less to do for

2119
03:22:06,932 --> 03:22:11,198
the people who work in these groups.

2120
03:22:11,198 --> 03:22:11,839
And if you want to work

2121
03:22:11,839 --> 03:22:12,700
together with us, then it's

2122
03:22:12,700 --> 03:22:14,422
a similar story again.

2123
03:22:14,422 --> 03:22:15,744
We have two new repositories,

2124
03:22:15,744 --> 03:22:17,767
so we don't use the same ones as we did before.

2125
03:22:17,767 --> 03:22:18,508
And again, there are

2126
03:22:18,508 --> 03:22:21,312
two repositories, because one will

2127
03:22:21,312 --> 03:22:23,556
be the recorded one, and the

2128
03:22:23,556 --> 03:22:25,559
other one is the one which is not recorded.

2129
03:22:25,559 --> 03:22:26,400
And during the stream, we

2130
03:22:26,400 --> 03:22:28,141
will now again focus on the recorded one.

2131
03:22:28,141 --> 03:22:28,782
So if you don't want

2132
03:22:28,782 --> 03:22:30,324
that username appears on the screen,

2133
03:22:30,324 --> 03:22:31,206
which then later on might

2134
03:22:31,206 --> 03:22:32,447
be then published to YouTube and

2135
03:22:32,447 --> 03:22:34,631
so on, please use the first one.

2136
03:22:34,631 --> 03:22:35,552
If you don't mind, please

2137
03:22:35,552 --> 03:22:37,936
use the second one, because if

2138
03:22:37,936 --> 03:22:39,498
you can show during the live stream

2139
03:22:39,498 --> 03:22:40,880
that many people use this

2140
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:42,483
repository, then I think it's a benefit.

2141
03:22:44,826 --> 03:22:45,167
OK.

2142
03:22:46,148 --> 03:22:46,889
So if you look at the

2143
03:22:46,889 --> 03:22:51,136
exercise itself, a lot of it

2144
03:22:51,136 --> 03:22:52,718
will be very familiar.

2145
03:22:52,718 --> 03:22:53,739
So you will be very familiar

2146
03:22:53,739 --> 03:22:57,385
with a lot of the steps here.

2147
03:22:57,385 --> 03:22:58,867
are just a few small changes

2148
03:22:58,867 --> 03:22:59,989
and the first one is that we

2149
03:22:59,989 --> 03:23:03,113
will now fork the repository and

2150
03:23:03,113 --> 03:23:04,015
then create a pull request

2151
03:23:04,015 --> 03:23:05,297
from the fork repository to

2152
03:23:05,297 --> 03:23:08,081
the upstream repository and during

2153
03:23:08,081 --> 03:23:08,922
that we will then also

2154
03:23:08,922 --> 03:23:10,504
learn how to synchronize their

2155
03:23:10,504 --> 03:23:16,213
repositories and also again mention

2156
03:23:16,213 --> 03:23:17,995
the issues in the original

2157
03:23:17,995 --> 03:23:20,099
repository so that they are connected

2158
03:23:20,099 --> 03:23:21,681
And also, then we will talk

2159
03:23:21,681 --> 03:23:22,863
a little bit more about the tests

2160
03:23:22,863 --> 03:23:23,784
that you've already encountered

2161
03:23:23,784 --> 03:23:25,327
so we didn't expect that you would.

2162
03:23:26,288 --> 03:23:27,330
So many of you will encounter

2163
03:23:27,330 --> 03:23:28,251
the tests in the first

2164
03:23:28,251 --> 03:23:29,873
exercise so we'll probably do

2165
03:23:29,873 --> 03:23:31,676
a little bit faster than we intended to,

2166
03:23:31,676 --> 03:23:32,838
but we will still mention it,

2167
03:23:32,838 --> 03:23:33,719
so if you have any questions

2168
03:23:33,719 --> 03:23:34,680
about that and just let us know

2169
03:23:34,680 --> 03:23:35,462
when we came up with that.

2170
03:23:36,944 --> 03:23:40,249
Again, the solutions are down

2171
03:23:40,249 --> 03:23:41,665
here, so if you have any.

2172
03:23:41,665 --> 03:23:42,927
If you're unsure about something,

2173
03:23:42,927 --> 03:23:45,330
then just have a look here for the documents.

2174
03:23:45,330 --> 03:23:46,252
This is not cheating.

2175
03:23:46,252 --> 03:23:48,535
It's just reading up on how to do things.

2176
03:23:48,535 --> 03:23:49,897
But we will also present it fast,

2177
03:23:49,897 --> 03:23:50,878
since I guess everyone's coming

2178
03:23:50,878 --> 03:23:51,600
back from lunch break.

2179
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:54,884
And maybe to give you a slower start,

2180
03:23:54,884 --> 03:23:56,166
we will quickly show you

2181
03:23:56,166 --> 03:23:58,049
the most important steps first.

2182
03:23:58,049 --> 03:23:59,591
Before I give the microphone to [name],

2183
03:23:59,591 --> 03:24:00,252
let me just quickly see

2184
03:24:00,252 --> 03:24:01,073
whether there are any new

2185
03:24:02,315 --> 03:24:04,278
questions in the collaborative document.

2186
03:24:04,278 --> 03:24:04,699
Let's see.

2187
03:24:08,845 --> 03:24:10,067
Is there an echo?

2188
03:24:10,067 --> 03:24:10,407
OK.

2189
03:24:11,500 --> 03:24:12,662
I hope that's just you.

2190
03:24:15,285 --> 03:24:16,948
If I ask some of my

2191
03:24:16,948 --> 03:24:19,231
co-teachers, do you encounter that?

2192
03:24:20,993 --> 03:24:21,394
I hope not.

2193
03:24:22,535 --> 03:24:23,437
Well, I take that as a no.

2194
03:24:25,199 --> 03:24:27,402
Ah, how to fork with command line, okay.

2195
03:24:27,402 --> 03:24:28,303
Yeah, so that's a good question.

2196
03:24:30,166 --> 03:24:31,348
Forking is not done on

2197
03:24:31,348 --> 03:24:33,951
the command line since it's a mechanism

2198
03:24:33,951 --> 03:24:34,833
or it's a feature that is

2199
03:24:34,833 --> 03:24:35,874
done inside of GitHub or

2200
03:24:35,874 --> 03:24:39,935
GitLab or whatever platform you use.

2201
03:24:39,935 --> 03:24:40,896
If you go, maybe we can

2202
03:24:40,896 --> 03:24:43,580
go quickly back to the first lecture.

2203
03:24:43,580 --> 03:24:45,162
Sorry, that was not what I intended.

2204
03:24:45,162 --> 03:24:48,966
I wanted to show this one.

2205
03:24:48,966 --> 03:24:53,912
And you remember this figure here.

2206
03:24:55,134 --> 03:24:55,755
You see we have this

2207
03:24:55,755 --> 03:24:57,897
repository and then cloning would

2208
03:24:57,897 --> 03:24:58,979
be down to your laptop.

2209
03:24:58,979 --> 03:24:59,840
So then that would mean that

2210
03:24:59,840 --> 03:25:01,342
you copy the whole repository

2211
03:25:01,342 --> 03:25:02,803
down to your machine.

2212
03:25:02,803 --> 03:25:05,226
But forking is inside of the cloud.

2213
03:25:05,226 --> 03:25:06,568
So inside of GitHub in this case.

2214
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:09,672
So we just copy the,

2215
03:25:11,440 --> 03:25:13,604
repository from the organization

2216
03:25:13,604 --> 03:25:16,008
that they're in to your private one.

2217
03:25:16,008 --> 03:25:17,189
I can maybe quickly demonstrate that.

2218
03:25:18,211 --> 03:25:19,233
So if I now go to

2219
03:25:19,233 --> 03:25:23,300
the organization, and let's now

2220
03:25:23,300 --> 03:25:24,461
take the forked one.

2221
03:25:24,461 --> 03:25:25,183
So we see here,

2222
03:25:25,984 --> 03:25:28,428
centralized workflow exercise recorded.

2223
03:25:31,673 --> 03:25:33,396
And now I see already two

2224
03:25:33,396 --> 03:25:36,942
people forked it, but I want to fork it myself.

2225
03:25:40,786 --> 03:25:42,629
Now, if I wouldn't have to zoom in

2226
03:25:42,629 --> 03:25:43,550
as closely as I am right

2227
03:25:43,550 --> 03:25:44,511
now for the stream, then it

2228
03:25:44,511 --> 03:25:45,453
would actually also tell me

2229
03:25:45,453 --> 03:25:47,195
fork, so it's easier to find.

2230
03:25:47,195 --> 03:25:48,157
But now I will click on

2231
03:25:48,157 --> 03:25:51,441
it, and then it will show

2232
03:25:51,441 --> 03:25:54,185
me the organization in which it will be stored.

2233
03:25:54,185 --> 03:25:54,986
So in this case, it's my

2234
03:25:54,986 --> 03:25:56,629
private one, but I can also choose other ones.

2235
03:25:56,629 --> 03:25:57,250
You can see here all

2236
03:25:57,250 --> 03:25:58,852
the organizations that I'm part of.

2237
03:25:58,852 --> 03:25:59,493
But in this case, I'll

2238
03:25:59,493 --> 03:26:00,995
just choose my private one.

2239
03:26:00,995 --> 03:26:02,217
And then here, the name I

2240
03:26:02,217 --> 03:26:03,499
can also change, but I can

2241
03:26:03,499 --> 03:26:04,380
also keep it the same.

2242
03:26:05,609 --> 03:26:06,570
And then I can choose whether

2243
03:26:06,570 --> 03:26:07,592
I only want to copy the main

2244
03:26:07,592 --> 03:26:09,595
branch or all of the branches that are existing.

2245
03:26:09,595 --> 03:26:10,296
And then I can create a

2246
03:26:10,296 --> 03:26:11,177
fork by clicking on this.

2247
03:26:12,860 --> 03:26:14,101
And that will take a little bit of time.

2248
03:26:14,943 --> 03:26:15,904
And it's now forking the

2249
03:26:15,904 --> 03:26:20,851
repository into my own GitHub account.

2250
03:26:20,851 --> 03:26:21,612
So now if you have

2251
03:26:21,612 --> 03:26:24,957
a look here, unfortunately, yeah.

2252
03:26:24,957 --> 03:26:27,000
So if I vlog this a

2253
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:28,643
little bit, maybe it's showing it properly.

2254
03:26:28,643 --> 03:26:29,183
Let's see.

2255
03:26:29,183 --> 03:26:29,604
Yeah.

2256
03:26:29,604 --> 03:26:30,505
Then you can see now it

2257
03:26:30,505 --> 03:26:33,810
is in my personal GitHub organization.

2258
03:26:35,326 --> 03:26:37,729
Okay, so that was walking.

2259
03:26:37,729 --> 03:26:40,713
[name], may I ask you to then go

2260
03:26:40,713 --> 03:26:47,562
through the exercise and we will, sorry,

2261
03:26:47,562 --> 03:26:48,663
go through the exercise here

2262
03:26:48,663 --> 03:26:50,646
of the third part of the lecture today.

2263
03:26:53,109 --> 03:26:54,651
So may I give the screenshot to you?

2264
03:26:57,935 --> 03:26:58,115
Yep.

2265
03:27:01,820 --> 03:27:03,462
And waiting for it to switch.

2266
03:27:03,462 --> 03:27:05,164
Oh, sorry, there we go.

2267
03:27:06,528 --> 03:27:09,400
All right, so looking at this,

2268
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:12,742
We're going to, what's going to

2269
03:27:12,742 --> 03:27:15,145
be new in this thing, first

2270
03:27:15,145 --> 03:27:15,665
of all, we're going to

2271
03:27:15,665 --> 03:27:17,547
fork the repository, create a

2272
03:27:17,547 --> 03:27:22,552
branch, making a change, and

2273
03:27:22,552 --> 03:27:23,934
of course, making pull requests.

2274
03:27:24,895 --> 03:27:29,580
And there, of course, are going to be,

2275
03:27:29,580 --> 03:27:31,682
but in this case, doing the forking

2276
03:27:31,682 --> 03:27:34,926
and getting pull requests back

2277
03:27:34,926 --> 03:27:40,011
to the main or the official repository.

2278
03:27:41,780 --> 03:27:44,422
We'll go up here and take a look at that.

2279
03:27:46,564 --> 03:27:48,926
So here is the official

2280
03:27:50,027 --> 03:27:53,911
forking workflow exercise repository here.

2281
03:27:53,911 --> 03:27:55,512
And as [name] showed, we're

2282
03:27:55,512 --> 03:27:57,274
just going to click here to fork that.

2283
03:27:59,756 --> 03:28:04,220
And I'm going to call it recipe book.

2284
03:28:06,942 --> 03:28:07,283
OK.

2285
03:28:07,283 --> 03:28:10,065
Oh, I already have one forked.

2286
03:28:11,783 --> 03:28:13,487
Okay, and we're just going to

2287
03:28:13,487 --> 03:28:15,291
copy the main branch because I

2288
03:28:15,291 --> 03:28:17,475
don't need to modify all those

2289
03:28:17,475 --> 03:28:18,658
and have all those other ones

2290
03:28:18,658 --> 03:28:19,620
so we'll create that fork.

2291
03:28:26,555 --> 03:28:29,452
Oh, I I sort of skipped over.

2292
03:28:29,452 --> 03:28:31,175
Yeah, well, so then that

2293
03:28:31,175 --> 03:28:33,559
prepares us for number one.

2294
03:28:33,559 --> 03:28:37,767
So going back to the

2295
03:28:38,949 --> 03:28:41,273
exercises here, let's go ahead

2296
03:28:41,273 --> 03:28:42,175
and create an issue.

2297
03:28:42,996 --> 03:28:44,639
Now, just to see what

2298
03:28:44,639 --> 03:28:46,964
issues might exist here, I'm going

2299
03:28:46,964 --> 03:28:48,025
to go look in desserts.

2300
03:28:49,408 --> 03:28:52,253
Or let's see.

2301
03:28:54,393 --> 03:28:56,395
Sure, desserts works.

2302
03:28:56,395 --> 03:28:57,276
Pumpkin pie.

2303
03:28:57,276 --> 03:28:59,319
And we have these nice

2304
03:28:59,319 --> 03:29:01,101
ingredients here and instructions.

2305
03:29:01,982 --> 03:29:04,425
And perhaps I want to make

2306
03:29:04,425 --> 03:29:09,912
this to have some optional ingredients such

2307
03:29:09,912 --> 03:29:14,016
as marshmallows on top or

2308
03:29:15,718 --> 03:29:17,080
chocolate chips or something to make

2309
03:29:17,080 --> 03:29:20,144
it a more interesting pumpkin pie.

2310
03:29:20,144 --> 03:29:24,143
So let's open an issue to do that.

2311
03:29:24,143 --> 03:29:25,826
So new issue.

2312
03:29:28,190 --> 03:29:36,423
Add optional ingredients to pumpkin pie.

2313
03:29:39,287 --> 03:29:40,870
We need some

2314
03:29:42,757 --> 03:29:49,350
additional ingredients to make the

2315
03:29:49,350 --> 03:29:51,154
pie more interesting.

2316
03:29:52,838 --> 03:29:55,483
Okay, so we'll go ahead and create that.

2317
03:29:59,378 --> 03:30:01,160
Okay, so this issue exists

2318
03:30:01,160 --> 03:30:02,302
and we're going to be able to

2319
03:30:02,302 --> 03:30:04,985
refer to it going forward.

2320
03:30:04,985 --> 03:30:06,968
So now coming over here, this

2321
03:30:06,968 --> 03:30:08,630
is our fork of my own

2322
03:30:09,431 --> 03:30:11,654
local repository here of that.

2323
03:30:11,654 --> 03:30:13,356
And it says here forked from,

2324
03:30:13,356 --> 03:30:15,699
so it knows where the original came from.

2325
03:30:16,601 --> 03:30:18,423
And so then step two is

2326
03:30:18,423 --> 03:30:20,385
going to be, of course, to create a branch.

2327
03:30:20,385 --> 03:30:21,066
So we can create a

2328
03:30:21,066 --> 03:30:27,715
branch, better pumpkin pie.

2329
03:30:29,011 --> 03:30:29,933
Rafal Dittwald, And we'll

2330
03:30:29,933 --> 03:30:33,319
create that French.

2331
03:30:33,319 --> 03:30:34,240
Rafal Dittwald, Okay, so then

2332
03:30:34,240 --> 03:30:36,204
we maybe mentioned yes i'm

2333
03:30:36,204 --> 03:30:38,227
sorry sorry could you maybe mention

2334
03:30:38,227 --> 03:30:39,129
why it's a good idea to

2335
03:30:39,129 --> 03:30:41,053
still create a new branch, because

2336
03:30:41,053 --> 03:30:42,114
we are in a different repository

2337
03:30:42,114 --> 03:30:43,577
now just use the main branch.

2338
03:30:44,738 --> 03:30:46,261
Well, we may want to

2339
03:30:46,261 --> 03:30:50,008
have multiple changes and we don't

2340
03:30:50,008 --> 03:30:52,272
want to have those all intermingled.

2341
03:30:53,394 --> 03:30:57,862
Also, if this is under review

2342
03:30:57,862 --> 03:31:00,167
and we come and add

2343
03:31:00,167 --> 03:31:03,713
more changes, then those changes

2344
03:31:03,713 --> 03:31:05,717
are included because we pull branch to branch.

2345
03:31:08,009 --> 03:31:08,850
So we don't

2346
03:31:08,850 --> 03:31:10,813
want to get things all combined.

2347
03:31:11,774 --> 03:31:13,236
So it's it's

2348
03:31:13,236 --> 03:31:15,338
it's best to have you

2349
03:31:15,338 --> 03:31:17,861
know compartmentalization keep a

2350
03:31:17,861 --> 03:31:19,864
separate branch for each separate

2351
03:31:19,864 --> 03:31:21,506
set of modifications that you're making.

2352
03:31:23,769 --> 03:31:24,290
- Okay.

2353
03:31:25,711 --> 03:31:26,372
- So we have

2354
03:31:26,372 --> 03:31:28,255
better pumpkin pie here and

2355
03:31:28,255 --> 03:31:29,636
now let's actually go and

2356
03:31:29,636 --> 03:31:34,202
make that happen desserts pumpkin pie.

2357
03:31:37,355 --> 03:31:39,537
- And so I

2358
03:31:39,537 --> 03:31:42,440
want some optional ingredients.

2359
03:31:49,208 --> 03:31:51,770
Chocolate chips

2360
03:31:51,770 --> 03:31:54,093
or marshmallows.

2361
03:31:55,875 --> 03:32:01,641
Okay, and we can throw in.

2362
03:32:03,612 --> 03:32:05,155
yeah okay so there,

2363
03:32:05,155 --> 03:32:07,098
there they are and we'll we'll

2364
03:32:07,098 --> 03:32:08,660
put in an instruction.

2365
03:32:08,660 --> 03:32:12,547
Add marshmallow

2366
03:32:12,547 --> 03:32:16,032
mellows on top, if included.

2367
03:32:16,032 --> 03:32:18,576
And now, this

2368
03:32:18,576 --> 03:32:19,859
is optional ingredients and then

2369
03:32:19,859 --> 03:32:20,680
we're going to put this and

2370
03:32:20,680 --> 03:32:22,583
call it required ingredients.

2371
03:32:23,862 --> 03:32:28,048
so that we can make use of

2372
03:32:28,048 --> 03:32:29,770
that in a future discussion.

2373
03:32:29,770 --> 03:32:30,731
Okay, so I'm going to go

2374
03:32:30,731 --> 03:32:32,153
ahead and commit changes there.

2375
03:32:32,153 --> 03:32:35,698
And I'm going to go ahead

2376
03:32:35,698 --> 03:32:37,240
and commit this directly to

2377
03:32:37,240 --> 03:32:38,682
my own branch because I'm doing it.

2378
03:32:40,965 --> 03:32:42,327
But I do like better

2379
03:32:42,327 --> 03:32:49,296
commit messages and optional ingredients.

2380
03:32:53,528 --> 03:32:55,230
Okay, so that's been committed.

2381
03:32:57,072 --> 03:32:58,274
All right, so now if we

2382
03:32:58,274 --> 03:33:02,299
go back to files here, not files,

2383
03:33:02,299 --> 03:33:04,602
go back to the main code location.

2384
03:33:05,884 --> 03:33:08,367
Okay, so we now have this

2385
03:33:08,367 --> 03:33:09,648
and you'll see here that

2386
03:33:09,648 --> 03:33:10,950
we have this indication where

2387
03:33:10,950 --> 03:33:11,891
it says this branch is now

2388
03:33:11,891 --> 03:33:15,456
one commit ahead of the repository

2389
03:33:15,456 --> 03:33:16,377
it was forked from.

2390
03:33:16,377 --> 03:33:19,020
And so we then have an

2391
03:33:19,020 --> 03:33:23,606
option to contribute this

2392
03:33:23,606 --> 03:33:25,509
particular branch that we've

2393
03:33:25,509 --> 03:33:29,333
constructed back to the original repository.

2394
03:33:31,536 --> 03:33:32,758
So let's look just looking

2395
03:33:32,758 --> 03:33:35,061
briefly at our list of steps.

2396
03:33:35,882 --> 03:33:38,605
We want to then, of course,

2397
03:33:40,610 --> 03:33:42,676
Make a pull request.

2398
03:33:44,802 --> 03:33:45,845
So we can do that here.

2399
03:33:47,569 --> 03:33:50,437
Open pull request.

2400
03:33:50,437 --> 03:33:53,005
And this is, well, sure.

2401
03:33:53,005 --> 03:33:56,374
Add optional agreements to pumpkin pie.

2402
03:33:58,447 --> 03:33:59,609
And here, if

2403
03:33:59,609 --> 03:34:00,910
we look back at our original

2404
03:34:00,910 --> 03:34:03,233
this was issue number four.

2405
03:34:04,515 --> 03:34:08,781
We need more ingredients.

2406
03:34:10,463 --> 03:34:14,688
In pumpkin I recipe.

2407
03:34:16,190 --> 03:34:17,853
Okay.

2408
03:34:17,853 --> 03:34:19,014
highlights the

2409
03:34:19,014 --> 03:34:19,695
branch names.

2410
03:34:20,502 --> 03:34:21,184
Yes.

2411
03:34:21,184 --> 03:34:22,026
Because that's the difference

2412
03:34:22,026 --> 03:34:22,587
to previously.

2413
03:34:24,311 --> 03:34:28,320
This addresses issue number four.

2414
03:34:28,320 --> 03:34:29,944
And there is the issue

2415
03:34:29,944 --> 03:34:30,906
that we're addressing.

2416
03:34:30,906 --> 03:34:31,187
Okay.

2417
03:34:32,049 --> 03:34:33,853
So here,

2418
03:34:34,778 --> 03:34:37,342
uh we were uh we forked

2419
03:34:37,342 --> 03:34:39,185
from a branch called main here um

2420
03:34:40,847 --> 03:34:44,873
but in our uh uh repository

2421
03:34:44,873 --> 03:34:49,300
we're um have this fork the

2422
03:34:49,300 --> 03:34:50,862
the branch is called better pumpkin pie

2423
03:34:51,723 --> 03:34:53,867
and so that's uh we're

2424
03:34:53,867 --> 03:34:55,890
committing it back into there uh

2425
03:34:55,890 --> 03:34:57,712
in in a different repository which

2426
03:34:57,712 --> 03:34:58,714
we can see the difference there

2427
03:34:58,714 --> 03:35:03,263
is that uh did you want additional comment okay

2428
03:35:03,263 --> 03:35:04,465
Yeah, so you can see

2429
03:35:04,465 --> 03:35:06,269
here the base repository and

2430
03:35:06,269 --> 03:35:08,032
the head repository is different,

2431
03:35:08,032 --> 03:35:09,636
but it's there to make sure

2432
03:35:09,636 --> 03:35:10,718
that we are forking into the

2433
03:35:10,718 --> 03:35:12,481
original one and not accidentally

2434
03:35:12,481 --> 03:35:14,645
into our own main branch.

2435
03:35:14,645 --> 03:35:14,806
Yeah.

2436
03:35:15,788 --> 03:35:16,810
So we wouldn't want it to

2437
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:19,816
be this because that wouldn't be

2438
03:35:19,816 --> 03:35:20,597
much of a change.

2439
03:35:22,012 --> 03:35:23,814
Um, of course now having done

2440
03:35:23,814 --> 03:35:26,797
that, it, uh, just goes away.

2441
03:35:28,138 --> 03:35:32,803
So, um, let's do that again.

2442
03:35:32,803 --> 03:35:33,844
Um, okay.

2443
03:35:33,844 --> 03:35:34,425
Contribute.

2444
03:35:34,425 --> 03:35:41,392
Oh yes.

2445
03:35:41,392 --> 03:35:42,413
Okay.

2446
03:35:42,413 --> 03:35:44,014
Let's go to our better pumpkin pie.

2447
03:35:44,014 --> 03:35:44,535
There we are.

2448
03:35:45,516 --> 03:35:45,796
Okay.

2449
03:35:45,796 --> 03:35:46,877
Now it's one commit ahead.

2450
03:35:46,877 --> 03:35:49,660
We can contribute, um, open

2451
03:35:49,660 --> 03:35:50,601
the pull request.

2452
03:35:53,146 --> 03:35:54,748
Okay.

2453
03:35:57,031 --> 03:36:01,016
Add more ingredients to pumpkin pie.

2454
03:36:03,440 --> 03:36:08,026
This fixes issue number four.

2455
03:36:08,947 --> 03:36:10,188
Okay.

2456
03:36:10,188 --> 03:36:13,753
And so then we create that pull request.

2457
03:36:17,378 --> 03:36:18,259
and allow

2458
03:36:18,259 --> 03:36:20,303
as maintainers and for now we're

2459
03:36:20,303 --> 03:36:22,487
going to just do this like that okay.

2460
03:36:22,487 --> 03:36:24,450
And that creates

2461
03:36:24,450 --> 03:36:25,973
our pull request and it heads

2462
03:36:25,973 --> 03:36:29,438
off to to now now, you can see that this is.

2463
03:36:30,540 --> 03:36:33,626
In the exercises.

2464
03:36:33,626 --> 03:36:36,510
account under

2465
03:36:36,510 --> 03:36:37,492
the original.

2466
03:36:38,594 --> 03:36:40,918
repository and

2467
03:36:40,918 --> 03:36:43,302
it's now listed here in the pull requests.

2468
03:36:45,188 --> 03:36:49,454
Okay, [name], you wanna now review that?

2469
03:36:51,196 --> 03:36:52,758
Sure, let's do that together.

2470
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:55,342
So I'm gonna wait until the

2471
03:36:56,303 --> 03:36:58,546
screen share is on my side again.

2472
03:37:02,091 --> 03:37:05,255
Okay, no, it's not right yet.

2473
03:37:05,255 --> 03:37:06,497
Yeah, that's yours.

2474
03:37:06,497 --> 03:37:07,959
Okay, okay.

2475
03:37:09,361 --> 03:37:11,364
Yeah, so we are back in the repository.

2476
03:37:12,505 --> 03:37:14,804
So we see here now the issue that

2477
03:37:14,804 --> 03:37:16,346
[name] has created.

2478
03:37:16,346 --> 03:37:17,127
Okay.

2479
03:37:17,127 --> 03:37:19,230
We need some additional ingredients

2480
03:37:19,230 --> 03:37:20,572
to make this part more interesting.

2481
03:37:20,572 --> 03:37:21,774
Sounds good.

2482
03:37:21,774 --> 03:37:25,379
And again, since [name] mentioned

2483
03:37:25,379 --> 03:37:29,105
the issue in this pull request,

2484
03:37:29,105 --> 03:37:30,827
it is already shown here that

2485
03:37:30,827 --> 03:37:31,688
we have this pull request,

2486
03:37:31,688 --> 03:37:33,171
which is addressing this issue.

2487
03:37:33,171 --> 03:37:33,852
Let's click on it.

2488
03:37:35,975 --> 03:37:36,616
Okay.

2489
03:37:36,616 --> 03:37:38,058
So same as before, we can

2490
03:37:38,058 --> 03:37:38,939
check now the name.

2491
03:37:39,980 --> 03:37:41,838
That seems to make sense.

2492
03:37:41,838 --> 03:37:44,301
We also see here from where

2493
03:37:44,301 --> 03:37:47,184
to where the pull request is

2494
03:37:47,184 --> 03:37:48,005
supposed to take place.

2495
03:37:48,005 --> 03:37:48,946
So we see here from

2496
03:37:48,946 --> 03:37:53,852
[name]'s forked repository into

2497
03:37:53,852 --> 03:37:56,415
the main branch of the

2498
03:37:56,415 --> 03:37:57,476
code refinery repository.

2499
03:37:57,476 --> 03:37:59,318
So that's what we want to have.

2500
03:37:59,318 --> 03:38:01,861
So let's look here further

2501
03:38:01,861 --> 03:38:03,904
down and see, okay, these tests,

2502
03:38:03,904 --> 03:38:05,546
they seem to fail.

2503
03:38:05,546 --> 03:38:06,407
So that's maybe something

2504
03:38:06,407 --> 03:38:06,867
we should address.

2505
03:38:08,809 --> 03:38:10,071
But before that, let's have a

2506
03:38:10,071 --> 03:38:11,052
look at the files itself.

2507
03:38:14,575 --> 03:38:17,759
Okay, so we see here there

2508
03:38:17,759 --> 03:38:19,121
are a few changes to this file.

2509
03:38:20,042 --> 03:38:21,585
We have optional ingredients.

2510
03:38:21,585 --> 03:38:23,988
So again, you can comment.

2511
03:38:32,600 --> 03:38:34,262
Developing ingredients.

2512
03:38:40,070 --> 03:38:40,971
So we can start to review.

2513
03:38:43,533 --> 03:38:45,155
Let's see, okay, we add

2514
03:38:45,155 --> 03:38:46,477
this, this looks also good.

2515
03:38:46,477 --> 03:38:47,878
And then here, okay, I might

2516
03:38:47,878 --> 03:38:48,779
spot what the problem is.

2517
03:38:50,782 --> 03:38:51,763
The problem is that our

2518
03:38:51,763 --> 03:38:54,006
test script requires there to

2519
03:38:54,006 --> 03:38:55,147
be an ingredient section and

2520
03:38:55,147 --> 03:38:56,189
not required ingredients.

2521
03:38:57,030 --> 03:38:57,991
So this is not something that

2522
03:38:57,991 --> 03:38:59,112
I can suggest to change.

2523
03:38:59,112 --> 03:39:01,375
And this time I will use

2524
03:39:01,375 --> 03:39:02,476
this plus minus sign again.

2525
03:39:02,476 --> 03:39:05,841
So I'll now make some suggestions.

2526
03:39:05,841 --> 03:39:07,002
So I'll suggest to remove

2527
03:39:07,002 --> 03:39:11,127
this required and add that as a new comment.

2528
03:39:12,659 --> 03:39:19,485
Okay, so now I can finish up the review.

2529
03:39:19,485 --> 03:39:20,246
So I can choose between

2530
03:39:20,246 --> 03:39:21,627
just commenting, I can approve it,

2531
03:39:21,627 --> 03:39:22,849
or I can request changes.

2532
03:39:22,849 --> 03:39:23,910
And since there is this one

2533
03:39:24,930 --> 03:39:27,913
change that I suggested, you could use that.

2534
03:39:27,913 --> 03:39:28,654
But I mean, in this case,

2535
03:39:28,654 --> 03:39:29,675
it's such a small one that I

2536
03:39:29,675 --> 03:39:30,456
might just do it myself.

2537
03:39:31,717 --> 03:39:33,779
Right, so I will approve this pull request.

2538
03:39:33,779 --> 03:39:34,800
Let's click on Submit Review.

2539
03:39:38,583 --> 03:39:40,805
Let's go to here, the overview

2540
03:39:40,805 --> 03:39:41,586
of the pull request.

2541
03:39:42,848 --> 03:39:44,530
So we see here the comment that I made,

2542
03:39:44,530 --> 03:39:45,351
and then we also see

2543
03:39:45,351 --> 03:39:46,953
here the suggestions that I made.

2544
03:39:46,953 --> 03:39:48,495
So I can now click

2545
03:39:48,495 --> 03:39:51,058
on commit suggestions, and I

2546
03:39:51,058 --> 03:39:52,300
can basically create a new

2547
03:39:52,300 --> 03:39:53,602
commit with the suggestions that

2548
03:39:53,602 --> 03:39:54,082
I made earlier.

2549
03:39:54,963 --> 03:39:56,005
So let's just maybe use

2550
03:39:56,005 --> 03:39:59,529
a more meaningful commit message than this.

2551
03:39:59,529 --> 03:40:06,338
Let's say fix subtitle, or what is this?

2552
03:40:06,338 --> 03:40:09,902
This title or section title.

2553
03:40:11,772 --> 03:40:17,399
to make it compatible with tests.

2554
03:40:19,923 --> 03:40:20,804
Hopefully that's fair enough.

2555
03:40:24,769 --> 03:40:25,570
And if I do this again,

2556
03:40:25,570 --> 03:40:27,573
let's see what the tests are passing this time.

2557
03:40:30,617 --> 03:40:31,918
So we see that they're running.

2558
03:40:31,918 --> 03:40:33,140
So we can click on this and

2559
03:40:33,140 --> 03:40:34,101
it will show us the details.

2560
03:40:35,683 --> 03:40:37,606
So we see the different steps in this test.

2561
03:40:37,606 --> 03:40:38,607
So it's setting up the job.

2562
03:40:39,447 --> 03:40:41,850
So setting a Python, installing PyTest,

2563
03:40:41,850 --> 03:40:42,751
which is the library that we

2564
03:40:42,751 --> 03:40:43,832
use for doing these tests.

2565
03:40:45,934 --> 03:40:47,276
And then we see, okay,

2566
03:40:47,276 --> 03:40:48,497
everything seems to work.

2567
03:40:48,497 --> 03:40:49,038
Nice.

2568
03:40:49,038 --> 03:40:49,678
The checks agree.

2569
03:40:50,880 --> 03:40:52,101
It's ready to be merged.

2570
03:40:52,101 --> 03:40:54,924
So let's go back to the pull request.

2571
03:40:58,328 --> 03:40:59,249
So we have to go back

2572
03:40:59,249 --> 03:41:00,671
to, sorry, not from action set,

2573
03:41:00,671 --> 03:41:02,152
click on pull request, of course.

2574
03:41:02,152 --> 03:41:03,013
Go to this pull request.

2575
03:41:03,995 --> 03:41:05,276
And now it can be merged.

2576
03:41:05,276 --> 03:41:06,197
So now I can merge it.

2577
03:41:15,830 --> 03:41:16,251
Okay.

2578
03:41:17,633 --> 03:41:18,554
[name], do you want to show

2579
03:41:18,554 --> 03:41:19,315
how it looks now on your

2580
03:41:19,315 --> 03:41:21,057
end, in the fork repository?

2581
03:41:21,899 --> 03:41:24,222
Sure.

2582
03:41:24,222 --> 03:41:26,826
So I'll give the screenshot back to you.

2583
03:41:26,826 --> 03:41:27,527
Maybe just one thing.

2584
03:41:27,527 --> 03:41:29,109
I'll just show you the history.

2585
03:41:29,109 --> 03:41:32,133
So the last thing in the

2586
03:41:32,133 --> 03:41:35,358
history of the main repository now

2587
03:41:35,358 --> 03:41:36,640
is I can see here that

2588
03:41:36,640 --> 03:41:37,701
I managed this pull request.

2589
03:41:38,783 --> 03:41:39,043
Okay.

2590
03:41:39,043 --> 03:41:40,345
But now there's a next

2591
03:41:40,345 --> 03:41:42,028
step in the exercise, [name], which

2592
03:41:42,028 --> 03:41:43,069
you have to do on your side.

2593
03:41:44,129 --> 03:41:46,213
synchronizing the two repositories?

2594
03:41:47,316 --> 03:41:48,679
Yeah.

2595
03:41:48,679 --> 03:41:49,059
Okay.

2596
03:41:49,059 --> 03:41:52,446
So as it says here, after

2597
03:41:52,446 --> 03:41:53,529
a few pull requests are

2598
03:41:53,529 --> 03:41:56,094
merged, your update your fork with changes.

2599
03:41:56,094 --> 03:41:58,680
So let's see what that's all about.

2600
03:41:58,680 --> 03:42:02,287
So here we are at main

2601
03:42:02,287 --> 03:42:04,251
here in my own repository.

2602
03:42:04,251 --> 03:42:04,632
There's

2603
03:42:04,632 --> 03:42:07,559
My account, this is the

2604
03:42:07,559 --> 03:42:08,823
repository that I named it.

2605
03:42:08,823 --> 03:42:09,925
And this is where it's from.

2606
03:42:10,727 --> 03:42:12,211
And we have this little information here.

2607
03:42:12,211 --> 03:42:13,655
This branch is three commits

2608
03:42:13,655 --> 03:42:16,722
behind this particular, I mean,

2609
03:42:16,722 --> 03:42:20,191
the original branch, the original, yeah.

2610
03:42:20,191 --> 03:42:23,197
repository and branch.

2611
03:42:23,197 --> 03:42:24,219
And so then we have the

2612
03:42:24,219 --> 03:42:26,764
option to update this branch

2613
03:42:26,764 --> 03:42:29,009
and pull the changes from it

2614
03:42:29,009 --> 03:42:33,979
into our local fork of the repository.

2615
03:42:34,841 --> 03:42:36,043
So we can click there and

2616
03:42:36,043 --> 03:42:37,947
then click update branch.

2617
03:42:41,082 --> 03:42:42,424
And then they come and now

2618
03:42:42,424 --> 03:42:45,188
it's all is there.

2619
03:42:45,188 --> 03:42:48,033
And so we have here the commits there.

2620
03:42:48,033 --> 03:42:49,876
We have the additional optional,

2621
03:42:49,876 --> 03:42:52,780
fix the section title and the

2622
03:42:52,780 --> 03:42:54,483
merge of the request.

2623
03:42:55,365 --> 03:42:56,707
So that has it there.

2624
03:42:56,707 --> 03:42:57,588
And if we wanted to just

2625
03:42:57,588 --> 03:42:58,990
see what that looks like, we

2626
03:42:58,990 --> 03:43:05,821
can go to the, oops, the forks.

2627
03:43:05,821 --> 03:43:06,282
Which was.

2628
03:43:08,145 --> 03:43:08,365
Right.

2629
03:43:10,468 --> 03:43:11,570
I think maybe.

2630
03:43:13,333 --> 03:43:13,513
Yes.

2631
03:43:17,560 --> 03:43:18,762
And I'm just going to move this.

2632
03:43:18,762 --> 03:43:19,723
And so there, we can see

2633
03:43:19,723 --> 03:43:26,133
how we have this fork and

2634
03:43:26,133 --> 03:43:27,956
that we've merged it back in,

2635
03:43:27,956 --> 03:43:31,742
into our main repository.

2636
03:43:31,742 --> 03:43:32,824
So there it is.

2637
03:43:34,525 --> 03:43:35,386
So this is something you

2638
03:43:35,386 --> 03:43:37,789
have to do yourself

2639
03:43:37,789 --> 03:43:39,410
because synchronization between

2640
03:43:39,410 --> 03:43:40,512
four repositories does not

2641
03:43:40,512 --> 03:43:41,373
happen automatically.

2642
03:43:42,314 --> 03:43:44,496
It's easy to do, to update it

2643
03:43:44,496 --> 03:43:45,978
as you have just seen now,

2644
03:43:45,978 --> 03:43:46,879
but you should keep in mind

2645
03:43:46,879 --> 03:43:47,640
that this is not something

2646
03:43:47,640 --> 03:43:48,621
that is done automatically.

2647
03:43:50,663 --> 03:43:51,844
So if you want to make

2648
03:43:51,844 --> 03:43:52,685
sure that you are not working

2649
03:43:52,685 --> 03:43:54,047
on an outdated one, regularly

2650
03:43:54,047 --> 03:43:55,408
check whether you can synchronize it.

2651
03:43:57,291 --> 03:43:59,153
Okay, I think we have

2652
03:43:59,153 --> 03:44:02,576
now 25 minutes planned again.

2653
03:44:02,576 --> 03:44:03,958
So I will share my screen again.

2654
03:44:11,785 --> 03:44:13,047
Okay, so if you go down

2655
03:44:13,047 --> 03:44:15,632
here, we have 25 minutes.

2656
03:44:15,632 --> 03:44:16,514
So that would mean that

2657
03:44:16,514 --> 03:44:21,243
the exercise will end by 10 to the full hour.

2658
03:44:21,243 --> 03:44:23,347
And then we have a 10 minute break.

2659
03:44:23,347 --> 03:44:24,810
So in 25 minutes, I will

2660
03:44:24,810 --> 03:44:27,535
just announce that the break will start.

2661
03:44:27,535 --> 03:44:29,018
And then in 35 minutes, we

2662
03:44:29,018 --> 03:44:30,581
are back to discuss any

2663
03:44:30,581 --> 03:44:32,786
remaining questions and wrap up

2664
03:44:32,786 --> 03:44:33,507
what we've learned today.

2665
03:44:35,377 --> 03:44:37,407
So having said that, good

2666
03:44:37,407 --> 03:44:39,075
luck with the last exercise and

2667
03:44:39,075 --> 03:44:41,508
see you in 25 minutes.

2668
03:44:41,508 --> 03:44:41,809
Bye.

2669
04:08:22,799 --> 04:08:24,461
Okay, we're back online.

2670
04:08:24,461 --> 04:08:24,982
Welcome back.

2671
04:08:26,564 --> 04:08:27,345
I see that a lot of

2672
04:08:27,345 --> 04:08:28,287
pull requests have already been

2673
04:08:28,287 --> 04:08:29,068
created and managed.

2674
04:08:29,068 --> 04:08:29,669
Thank you for that.

2675
04:08:31,852 --> 04:08:32,893
There was one question which

2676
04:08:32,893 --> 04:08:34,135
I quickly wanted to address since

2677
04:08:34,135 --> 04:08:35,437
I think it's not something

2678
04:08:35,437 --> 04:08:37,760
we have mentioned and can be quite confusing.

2679
04:08:37,760 --> 04:08:39,282
And that's this question here.

2680
04:08:39,282 --> 04:08:40,724
How do you create a folder on GitHub?

2681
04:08:41,526 --> 04:08:42,387
So let me just go to

2682
04:08:42,387 --> 04:08:43,248
one of the repositories.

2683
04:08:44,069 --> 04:08:47,174
This is maybe a bit counterintuitive,

2684
04:08:47,174 --> 04:08:49,417
but in GitHub, it doesn't

2685
04:08:49,417 --> 04:08:52,178
track any folders, only files.

2686
04:08:52,178 --> 04:08:53,079
So, but you can trick

2687
04:08:53,079 --> 04:08:54,781
it into creating folders by

2688
04:08:54,781 --> 04:08:56,884
creating a file inside of that folder.

2689
04:08:56,884 --> 04:08:57,745
So I just quickly want to

2690
04:08:57,745 --> 04:08:58,426
show how to do that.

2691
04:08:59,467 --> 04:09:00,168
If you're in your GitHub

2692
04:09:00,168 --> 04:09:01,230
repository like this one, you

2693
04:09:01,230 --> 04:09:02,611
can click here on plus and

2694
04:09:02,611 --> 04:09:03,473
then create new file.

2695
04:09:05,335 --> 04:09:06,737
And then you can choose the file name here.

2696
04:09:06,737 --> 04:09:12,945
And by making a directory, we can do

2697
04:09:12,945 --> 04:09:14,707
that by choosing the directory

2698
04:09:14,707 --> 04:09:17,150
name, let's say fish with this.

2699
04:09:17,150 --> 04:09:19,904
And then we do slash.

2700
04:09:19,904 --> 04:09:21,326
And now we've created a directory,

2701
04:09:21,326 --> 04:09:22,347
and now we've created a file

2702
04:09:22,347 --> 04:09:24,089
inside of the directory.

2703
04:09:24,089 --> 04:09:25,110
So we can have, I don't

2704
04:09:29,736 --> 04:09:32,038
know, let's see, I don't know, .

2705
04:09:41,970 --> 04:09:43,952
So if I do it like this,

2706
04:09:43,952 --> 04:09:46,956
and I commit the changes, which I

2707
04:09:46,956 --> 04:09:48,117
now do, by the way, in my

2708
04:09:48,117 --> 04:09:50,465
own repository, so I'm not

2709
04:09:50,465 --> 04:09:51,987
I'm not screwing up the central one.

2710
04:09:52,968 --> 04:09:55,171
If I commit this, cool, but

2711
04:09:55,171 --> 04:09:58,274
I was thinking of a nice commit message.

2712
04:09:58,274 --> 04:09:59,296
Yeah, okay, I'm happy with that.

2713
04:10:03,541 --> 04:10:04,983
If I now go to the code,

2714
04:10:04,983 --> 04:10:08,126
and now I see there is an additional directory,

2715
04:10:08,126 --> 04:10:09,268
and inside of this directory,

2716
04:10:09,268 --> 04:10:10,469
I have now the file that I created.

2717
04:10:11,370 --> 04:10:13,077
So this might not be really

2718
04:10:13,077 --> 04:10:14,258
intuitive, at least.

2719
04:10:15,099 --> 04:10:16,200
I run into this problem also

2720
04:10:16,200 --> 04:10:17,402
myself a few times where I

2721
04:10:17,402 --> 04:10:18,923
was confused about not being

2722
04:10:18,923 --> 04:10:19,904
able to add directories.

2723
04:10:19,904 --> 04:10:21,126
So hopefully this answers the question.

2724
04:10:22,447 --> 04:10:23,388
Let's see whether there are

2725
04:10:23,388 --> 04:10:24,189
any other questions.

2726
04:10:25,150 --> 04:10:25,951
Yeah, so should you make

2727
04:10:25,951 --> 04:10:28,193
a draft pull request or a pull request?

2728
04:10:28,193 --> 04:10:30,395
This is something we addressed

2729
04:10:30,395 --> 04:10:32,318
earlier, but I think it's good to repeat it.

2730
04:10:32,318 --> 04:10:35,181
So you would create a draft pull request

2731
04:10:35,181 --> 04:10:36,942
if you have some changes that

2732
04:10:36,942 --> 04:10:40,685
are not done yet, but that you want to

2733
04:10:40,685 --> 04:10:41,546
get feedback on.

2734
04:10:41,546 --> 04:10:42,287
So it can already show

2735
04:10:42,287 --> 04:10:43,209
other people, look, this is

2736
04:10:43,209 --> 04:10:43,890
what I'm working on.

2737
04:10:43,890 --> 04:10:45,372
This is the structure of the

2738
04:10:45,372 --> 04:10:46,213
code that I envisioned.

2739
04:10:46,213 --> 04:10:49,338
These are the topics that I want to tackle.

2740
04:10:49,338 --> 04:10:49,999
And then you can already

2741
04:10:49,999 --> 04:10:51,121
get feedback before you actually

2742
04:10:51,121 --> 04:10:52,363
have to implement every single bit.

2743
04:10:53,284 --> 04:10:54,566
But if you have a really clear idea of

2744
04:10:54,566 --> 04:10:55,447
what you want to do, and

2745
04:10:55,447 --> 04:10:56,970
you already have everything with

2746
04:10:56,970 --> 04:10:57,851
mouse, then you would try to

2747
04:10:57,851 --> 04:10:58,872
no local requests because then

2748
04:10:58,872 --> 04:10:59,453
it can be crashed.

2749
04:11:01,496 --> 04:11:01,837
Okay.

2750
04:11:03,079 --> 04:11:03,940
We said that we would have

2751
04:11:03,940 --> 04:11:04,921
a 10 minute break now.

2752
04:11:04,921 --> 04:11:06,604
So that would be the last break.

2753
04:11:06,604 --> 04:11:10,182
So we have it now.

2754
04:11:10,182 --> 04:11:11,926
1452 in Central Europe.

2755
04:11:11,926 --> 04:11:13,250
So let's say we meet at

2756
04:11:13,250 --> 04:11:15,696
two past the full hour for

2757
04:11:15,696 --> 04:11:17,841
the last Q&A session and to wrap up

2758
04:11:17,841 --> 04:11:18,703
what we've learned today and

2759
04:11:18,703 --> 04:11:20,307
give you an outlook on the

2760
04:11:20,307 --> 04:11:21,470
lectures that will follow up in

2761
04:11:21,470 --> 04:11:22,332
the next couple of weeks in

2762
04:11:22,332 --> 04:11:24,478
the Codify Me seminar.

2763
04:11:24,478 --> 04:11:27,325
So with that said, see you all at two past.

2764
04:11:27,325 --> 04:11:27,465
Bye.

2765
04:20:23,480 --> 04:20:25,863
Okay, welcome back everyone to

2766
04:20:25,863 --> 04:20:28,226
the last part of today's

2767
04:20:28,226 --> 04:20:30,909
seminar, of today's lectures.

2768
04:20:31,810 --> 04:20:34,012
I see there was actually quite

2769
04:20:34,012 --> 04:20:36,155
a few good questions here in the document.

2770
04:20:36,155 --> 04:20:37,176
Most of them are already answered,

2771
04:20:37,176 --> 04:20:37,957
but the last one I would

2772
04:20:37,957 --> 04:20:40,720
like to discuss here on stream as well.

2773
04:20:41,922 --> 04:20:43,103
So the question is, when

2774
04:20:43,103 --> 04:20:45,085
we have modified our own fork,

2775
04:20:46,187 --> 04:20:46,867
and in the meantime, the

2776
04:20:46,867 --> 04:20:48,289
original repository has moved on.

2777
04:20:50,716 --> 04:20:52,057
how do we deal with these situations?

2778
04:20:52,057 --> 04:20:53,879
Like when do we sync and

2779
04:20:53,879 --> 04:20:56,061
how do we make sure that, or

2780
04:20:56,061 --> 04:20:58,283
what is the best approach in this situation?

2781
04:21:01,086 --> 04:21:03,388
So this is hinting one concept

2782
04:21:03,388 --> 04:21:04,309
that we have not discussed

2783
04:21:04,309 --> 04:21:05,270
today, but yesterday, and

2784
04:21:05,270 --> 04:21:06,291
that's merge conflicts.

2785
04:21:07,111 --> 04:21:09,834
So if the changes that you have made

2786
04:21:09,834 --> 04:21:10,955
and the changes which have

2787
04:21:10,955 --> 04:21:12,937
happened on the upstream repository,

2788
04:21:12,937 --> 04:21:15,319
if they don't address the same

2789
04:21:15,319 --> 04:21:16,961
files or the same lines in

2790
04:21:16,961 --> 04:21:18,482
the same file, then this is

2791
04:21:18,482 --> 04:21:19,808
not a problem really.

2792
04:21:19,808 --> 04:21:21,070
But of course you can

2793
04:21:21,070 --> 04:21:22,531
run into merge conflicts.

2794
04:21:22,531 --> 04:21:23,292
So let's say like you

2795
04:21:23,292 --> 04:21:25,875
are working on changing a recipe.

2796
04:21:25,875 --> 04:21:27,357
Let's say this baked salmon recipe

2797
04:21:27,357 --> 04:21:28,358
that I made previously, like

2798
04:21:28,358 --> 04:21:31,041
in the instructions I added a certain tool.

2799
04:21:31,041 --> 04:21:31,742
And then in the meantime,

2800
04:21:31,742 --> 04:21:33,745
someone else has done something similar

2801
04:21:33,745 --> 04:21:35,487
and the other one has been merged

2802
04:21:35,487 --> 04:21:36,228
and there will be a

2803
04:21:36,228 --> 04:21:38,030
merge conflict which then needs to be resolved.

2804
04:21:38,030 --> 04:21:38,831
And then you need actually

2805
04:21:38,831 --> 04:21:40,993
one person during the review

2806
04:21:40,993 --> 04:21:45,799
then deciding which, which,

2807
04:21:46,707 --> 04:21:48,089
commits to or like which

2808
04:21:48,089 --> 04:21:51,094
changed to actually then commit to the branch.

2809
04:21:51,094 --> 04:21:52,757
So merge conflicts can still occur,

2810
04:21:52,757 --> 04:21:53,859
even if you use pull requests

2811
04:21:53,859 --> 04:21:54,319
and if you work

2812
04:21:54,319 --> 04:21:56,864
between different repositories, that's

2813
04:21:56,864 --> 04:21:58,206
not something you can magically escape from.

2814
04:21:59,528 --> 04:22:00,630
So I think, yeah, so thank

2815
04:22:00,630 --> 04:22:01,491
you very much for this question.

2816
04:22:01,491 --> 04:22:03,414
I think it kind of pinpointed, well,

2817
04:22:03,414 --> 04:22:05,357
like it's good that you asked

2818
04:22:05,357 --> 04:22:06,820
because it's reminded me

2819
04:22:06,820 --> 04:22:08,963
of mentioning merge conflicts once again.

2820
04:22:10,446 --> 04:22:13,859
In general, I would try to always think

2821
04:22:13,859 --> 04:22:15,601
branch that I work on as frequently

2822
04:22:15,601 --> 04:22:16,542
as possible with the upstream

2823
04:22:16,542 --> 04:22:17,544
branch to make sure that

2824
04:22:17,544 --> 04:22:19,206
they don't diverge too far.

2825
04:22:20,207 --> 04:22:25,073
Because if you get kind of,

2826
04:22:25,073 --> 04:22:25,934
if you end up working with

2827
04:22:25,934 --> 04:22:27,135
an outdated version of the

2828
04:22:27,135 --> 04:22:29,138
curves, then your changes are

2829
04:22:29,959 --> 04:22:30,940
probably not going to be very

2830
04:22:30,940 --> 04:22:38,089
welcome in the original repository.

2831
04:22:38,089 --> 04:22:38,409
Okay.

2832
04:22:40,933 --> 04:22:42,154
So let's wrap up.

2833
04:22:42,154 --> 04:22:42,955
Let's go to the

2834
04:22:43,812 --> 04:22:47,677
summary section of the lecture material.

2835
04:22:48,559 --> 04:22:49,420
So we've learned now how

2836
04:22:49,420 --> 04:22:50,962
we can approach other people's repositories.

2837
04:22:52,204 --> 04:22:53,706
And we have here this nice summary,

2838
04:22:53,706 --> 04:22:54,908
which tells you what to do

2839
04:22:54,908 --> 04:22:55,929
depending on the size of the

2840
04:22:55,929 --> 04:22:56,931
project or the changes that

2841
04:22:56,931 --> 04:22:58,413
you want to propose.

2842
04:22:58,413 --> 04:22:59,314
So if it's just a very

2843
04:22:59,314 --> 04:23:02,999
small one, then the go-to suggestion

2844
04:23:02,999 --> 04:23:05,723
would be to clone the repository,

2845
04:23:05,723 --> 04:23:07,866
create a new branch, push your

2846
04:23:07,866 --> 04:23:10,350
changes to the repository, and

2847
04:23:10,350 --> 04:23:11,271
then create a pull request.

2848
04:23:13,276 --> 04:23:15,478
If you work on the largest system,

2849
04:23:15,478 --> 04:23:17,140
or sorry, a larger project

2850
04:23:17,140 --> 04:23:18,461
with more people or with someone

2851
04:23:18,461 --> 04:23:19,943
that you don't know as well,

2852
04:23:19,943 --> 04:23:21,044
let's say you want to reach

2853
04:23:21,044 --> 04:23:24,507
out to the maintainers of the Python library,

2854
04:23:24,507 --> 04:23:25,809
or it could be Julia library, whatever,

2855
04:23:27,090 --> 04:23:28,411
you might want to actually

2856
04:23:28,411 --> 04:23:31,414
discuss it first via an issue

2857
04:23:31,414 --> 04:23:32,756
or a draft pull request, whether

2858
04:23:32,756 --> 04:23:34,478
what you intend to do makes

2859
04:23:34,478 --> 04:23:35,419
sense to them and whether

2860
04:23:35,419 --> 04:23:36,940
that's something, or whether that's

2861
04:23:36,940 --> 04:23:40,083
a direction they want the project to go in.

2862
04:23:40,083 --> 04:23:40,804
So in this case, you will

2863
04:23:40,804 --> 04:23:42,726
also create a issue first,

2864
04:23:43,735 --> 04:23:44,776
But you describe the problem,

2865
04:23:44,776 --> 04:23:47,579
so always over-describe, how would

2866
04:23:47,579 --> 04:23:49,641
you say, like over-explain what the issue is.

2867
04:23:49,641 --> 04:23:50,742
Like you're not talking to

2868
04:23:50,742 --> 04:23:51,764
people in person, you're doing

2869
04:23:51,764 --> 04:23:53,145
everything by text.

2870
04:23:53,145 --> 04:23:55,928
So you be very specific

2871
04:23:55,928 --> 04:23:56,829
and be very concrete.

2872
04:23:58,210 --> 04:24:00,293
And then in the best case, like wait

2873
04:24:00,293 --> 04:24:02,495
for feedback before you start

2874
04:24:02,495 --> 04:24:04,817
writing 5,000 lines of code to make sure

2875
04:24:04,817 --> 04:24:06,519
that your contributions are

2876
04:24:06,519 --> 04:24:11,204
actually welcomed by the contributors

2877
04:24:11,204 --> 04:24:12,966
or by the maintainers of the project.

2878
04:24:13,942 --> 04:24:15,504
And then if you have received feedback

2879
04:24:15,504 --> 04:24:16,766
and if they give the green

2880
04:24:16,766 --> 04:24:17,908
lights to go on and work

2881
04:24:17,908 --> 04:24:19,330
on this project, then you can

2882
04:24:19,330 --> 04:24:20,833
put in the hours and actually

2883
04:24:20,833 --> 04:24:22,014
write the code that you want to contribute.

2884
04:24:24,939 --> 04:24:27,142
And also by creating this

2885
04:24:27,142 --> 04:24:29,005
issue, you also indicate that

2886
04:24:29,005 --> 04:24:30,508
this is something that you work

2887
04:24:30,508 --> 04:24:31,850
on to make sure that not

2888
04:24:31,850 --> 04:24:33,252
other people have the same, find

2889
04:24:33,252 --> 04:24:34,073
out the same problem.

2890
04:24:34,073 --> 04:24:35,095
And then you have three,

2891
04:24:35,095 --> 04:24:36,156
four people working on the

2892
04:24:36,156 --> 04:24:37,318
same, fixing the same issue if

2893
04:24:37,318 --> 04:24:38,340
only one would be required.

2894
04:24:41,324 --> 04:24:41,805
Okay.

2895
04:24:45,532 --> 04:24:47,915
Yeah, similar story if you have an idea

2896
04:24:47,915 --> 04:24:48,736
for a new feature in a

2897
04:24:48,736 --> 04:24:50,257
codebase and you want to suggest that.

2898
04:24:52,240 --> 04:24:53,401
Let's see, I mean, we've

2899
04:24:53,401 --> 04:24:54,562
already spoken about all these things.

2900
04:24:54,562 --> 04:24:56,164
So in principle, we are done

2901
04:24:56,164 --> 04:24:58,607
with most of, or basically all

2902
04:24:58,607 --> 04:24:59,608
of the lectures for today.

2903
04:25:00,409 --> 04:25:01,230
Let me just click to see

2904
04:25:01,230 --> 04:25:02,151
in the document if there are

2905
04:25:02,151 --> 04:25:03,613
any questions that came up.

2906
04:25:06,336 --> 04:25:07,477
No, there's a longer answer.

2907
04:25:09,399 --> 04:25:12,182
If there are no questions, then

2908
04:25:12,182 --> 04:25:14,425
I think we can wrap up

2909
04:25:15,788 --> 04:25:16,709
lecture for today.

2910
04:25:16,709 --> 04:25:20,274
And in which case I will

2911
04:25:20,274 --> 04:25:22,097
then give the words to [name]

2912
04:25:23,960 --> 04:25:25,301
to give an outline on the

2913
04:25:25,301 --> 04:25:27,304
upcoming lectures of the Code

2914
04:25:27,304 --> 04:25:28,947
of Pioneering workshop now.

2915
04:25:28,947 --> 04:25:29,788
But before I do that, I

2916
04:25:29,788 --> 04:25:31,190
just want to thank everyone who's involved.

2917
04:25:32,331 --> 04:25:34,575
You only see people in front of the camera.

2918
04:25:34,575 --> 04:25:36,838
So that's me and [name] and [name].

2919
04:25:36,838 --> 04:25:37,599
So thank you all for

2920
04:25:38,420 --> 04:25:39,562
volunteering to work on this.

2921
04:25:39,562 --> 04:25:42,286
It's always a pleasure to work with you.

2922
04:25:42,286 --> 04:25:42,926
But there are also many

2923
04:25:42,926 --> 04:25:43,848
more people behind the camera

2924
04:25:43,848 --> 04:25:45,320
which have not been

2925
04:25:45,320 --> 04:25:47,222
directly seen, which I also want to thank.

2926
04:25:47,222 --> 04:25:48,703
So [name], [name], [name], and

2927
04:25:48,703 --> 04:25:49,965
all the others who have worked on this.

2928
04:25:50,846 --> 04:25:52,187
It's quite a find we wouldn't work

2929
04:25:52,187 --> 04:25:53,688
if there wouldn't be that

2930
04:25:53,688 --> 04:25:56,051
many people putting in so

2931
04:25:56,051 --> 04:25:58,573
much effort and volunteer to work on this.

2932
04:25:58,573 --> 04:25:59,855
So thank you all for doing that.

2933
04:25:59,855 --> 04:26:01,056
And also thank you for

2934
04:26:01,056 --> 04:26:01,697
coming to the course.

2935
04:26:01,697 --> 04:26:03,378
And I hope that the

2936
04:26:03,378 --> 04:26:04,439
concepts that you've learned today

2937
04:26:04,439 --> 04:26:05,480
will help you in your

2938
04:26:05,480 --> 04:26:07,522
future academic careers and make

2939
04:26:07,522 --> 04:26:08,924
your life and your everyday

2940
04:26:08,924 --> 04:26:09,985
life as a researcher easier.

2941
04:26:11,226 --> 04:26:14,009
So with that said, [name], may

2942
04:26:14,009 --> 04:26:15,745
I give the word to you?

2943
04:26:15,745 --> 04:26:17,867
Thank you so much, [name] and [name].

2944
04:26:18,869 --> 04:26:22,313
I hope all the participants felt

2945
04:26:22,313 --> 04:26:23,934
how important this day was and

2946
04:26:23,934 --> 04:26:25,977
how fun it is to

2947
04:26:25,977 --> 04:26:28,139
collaborate with other people and

2948
04:26:28,139 --> 04:26:30,902
or improve somebody else's repository.

2949
04:26:32,084 --> 04:26:34,587
So if you, and we can

2950
04:26:34,587 --> 04:26:36,168
also switch here to the notes

2951
04:26:36,168 --> 04:26:39,272
document so that we can see it.

2952
04:26:40,670 --> 04:26:41,972
in the at the bottom of

2953
04:26:41,972 --> 04:26:43,054
the notes document you can

2954
04:26:43,054 --> 04:26:44,215
keep on asking questions of

2955
04:26:44,215 --> 04:26:47,921
course that's the feedback for today

2956
04:26:49,183 --> 04:26:50,825
and the news box is

2957
04:26:50,825 --> 04:26:52,307
of course the interesting one

2958
04:26:53,349 --> 04:26:55,031
today we cover everything as is

2959
04:26:55,031 --> 04:26:57,395
in the schedule and please

2960
04:26:57,395 --> 04:26:58,837
feel free to continue to

2961
04:26:58,837 --> 04:27:01,641
explore the github interface this

2962
04:27:01,641 --> 04:27:03,364
is actually a great opportunity

2963
04:27:03,364 --> 04:27:04,345
because you know

2964
04:27:04,345 --> 04:27:06,027
Even if you do mistakes, even

2965
04:27:06,027 --> 04:27:07,929
if you, I don't know, break

2966
04:27:07,929 --> 04:27:11,493
one of these exercise repositories,

2967
04:27:11,493 --> 04:27:12,654
that's the purpose of it.

2968
04:27:12,654 --> 04:27:14,276
So you can play with the buttons

2969
04:27:14,276 --> 04:27:15,757
and any other features that we

2970
04:27:15,757 --> 04:27:16,878
did not have time to cover.

2971
04:27:18,340 --> 04:27:20,402
For next week, for the part

2972
04:27:20,402 --> 04:27:24,126
two of Code Refinery, so back until last year,

2973
04:27:24,126 --> 04:27:25,408
until last springtime, we used

2974
04:27:25,408 --> 04:27:27,650
to have it again as a second week.

2975
04:27:27,650 --> 04:27:29,452
but now from the feedback

2976
04:27:29,452 --> 04:27:30,633
from previous year we decided to

2977
04:27:30,633 --> 04:27:31,654
change it a little bit and

2978
04:27:31,654 --> 04:27:33,696
instead of having a second week

2979
04:27:33,696 --> 04:27:35,017
and that's it we're gonna

2980
04:27:35,017 --> 04:27:38,141
have single episodes every Wednesday

2981
04:27:38,141 --> 04:27:39,802
for the next six weeks

2982
04:27:40,943 --> 04:27:43,146
there will be shorter episodes of two

2983
04:27:43,146 --> 04:27:45,268
and a half hours each and

2984
04:27:45,268 --> 04:27:46,469
they will still cover the

2985
04:27:46,469 --> 04:27:48,671
usual Code Refinery workshop materials

2986
04:27:49,812 --> 04:27:50,753
but the idea is more

2987
04:27:50,753 --> 04:27:53,156
that they are self-contained episodes

2988
04:27:53,156 --> 04:27:55,358
so that if there's something

2989
04:27:55,358 --> 04:27:57,502
that is truly interesting you

2990
04:27:57,502 --> 04:27:59,165
can also share it with your colleagues

2991
04:27:59,165 --> 04:28:01,489
who maybe are happy just to join

2992
04:28:01,489 --> 04:28:03,833
for that for that workshop let's say

2993
04:28:03,833 --> 04:28:04,654
that you're planning to

2994
04:28:04,654 --> 04:28:06,558
write documentation together and you

2995
04:28:06,558 --> 04:28:07,820
want all your colleagues to

2996
04:28:07,820 --> 04:28:09,803
watch the documentation episode and

2997
04:28:09,803 --> 04:28:11,967
so on so feel free to browse

2998
04:28:11,967 --> 04:28:14,872
the topics for the future days

2999
04:28:14,872 --> 04:28:18,258
the next one will be next wednesday

3000
04:28:18,258 --> 04:28:20,841
at 12 o'clock oslo stockholm

3001
04:28:20,841 --> 04:28:23,483
rome time zone and that's

3002
04:28:23,483 --> 04:28:27,087
the main workshop about reproducibility

3003
04:28:27,087 --> 04:28:29,109
and we will cover everything

3004
04:28:29,109 --> 04:28:31,571
from the reproducibility crisis

3005
04:28:31,571 --> 04:28:36,296
to data management out organized folders

3006
04:28:36,296 --> 04:28:37,777
and also considering the

3007
04:28:37,777 --> 04:28:39,899
whole computer because sometimes

3008
04:28:39,899 --> 04:28:41,420
when you change computer things

3009
04:28:41,420 --> 04:28:43,683
are not reproducible anymore and

3010
04:28:43,683 --> 04:28:46,085
so we will introduce concepts like

3011
04:28:46,085 --> 04:28:49,553
containers and environments and

3012
04:28:49,553 --> 04:28:50,863
things like that.

3013
04:28:51,788 --> 04:28:53,651
Right, so we're actually a

3014
04:28:53,651 --> 04:28:55,273
little bit early, meaning that

3015
04:28:55,273 --> 04:28:57,957
we will still have a few minutes.

3016
04:28:57,957 --> 04:29:01,682
So if there's questions, please,

3017
04:29:01,682 --> 04:29:03,405
you can keep on sending them.

3018
04:29:03,405 --> 04:29:04,126
Maybe I can ask a

3019
04:29:04,126 --> 04:29:06,289
question to our instructors here.

3020
04:29:07,170 --> 04:29:09,874
Do you often contribute to

3021
04:29:09,874 --> 04:29:11,737
other people, people that you don't know?

3022
04:29:11,737 --> 04:29:13,660
Do you contribute to

3023
04:29:13,660 --> 04:29:17,886
their repositories, like with pull requests,

3024
04:29:17,886 --> 04:29:18,627
with the techniques that

3025
04:29:18,627 --> 04:29:20,209
you've shown today, [name]?

3026
04:29:22,130 --> 04:29:24,216
Not frequently, but I have

3027
04:29:25,259 --> 04:29:26,844
created sample requests to

3028
04:29:26,844 --> 04:29:28,048
the documentation of some

3029
04:29:28,048 --> 04:29:29,171
programming languages and so on.

3030
04:29:29,171 --> 04:29:31,017
There were some smaller fixes here

3031
04:29:31,017 --> 04:29:31,739
and there, but I saw that

3032
04:29:31,739 --> 04:29:32,622
there was a small typo

3033
04:29:32,622 --> 04:29:34,507
or something which clearly was wrong.

3034
04:29:35,410 --> 04:29:36,072
Yeah, definitely.

3035
04:29:40,827 --> 04:29:41,889
Which project was there?

3036
04:29:41,889 --> 04:29:43,313
Was it some library?

3037
04:29:44,415 --> 04:29:45,417
Plasma Pi.

3038
04:29:45,417 --> 04:29:47,582
So in plasma physics, that

3039
04:29:47,582 --> 04:29:49,947
is the biggest Python package that,

3040
04:29:49,947 --> 04:29:51,972
as far as I know, exists.

3041
04:29:51,972 --> 04:29:52,974
And I contributed some of

3042
04:29:52,974 --> 04:29:54,738
the routines through my postdoc

3043
04:29:54,738 --> 04:29:56,061
that we developed in our research group.

3044
04:29:56,061 --> 04:29:57,985
So that's more people than

3045
04:29:57,985 --> 04:29:59,909
just our research group have access to.

3046
04:29:59,909 --> 04:30:00,908
I see, I see.

3047
04:30:00,908 --> 04:30:02,530
Yeah, definitely fixing typos

3048
04:30:02,530 --> 04:30:03,311
and small things.

3049
04:30:03,311 --> 04:30:05,233
It's something that now all of you

3050
04:30:05,233 --> 04:30:06,234
who are watching can

3051
04:30:06,234 --> 04:30:08,316
actually immediately start doing.

3052
04:30:08,316 --> 04:30:09,377
I've been also doing that.

3053
04:30:09,377 --> 04:30:11,579
And in the end, you might

3054
04:30:11,579 --> 04:30:14,162
read a nice documentation or even books

3055
04:30:14,162 --> 04:30:15,764
because with Git, you can

3056
04:30:15,764 --> 04:30:18,326
also create books and you find

3057
04:30:18,326 --> 04:30:20,949
a typo or there's a way to improve something.

3058
04:30:20,949 --> 04:30:22,110
And it's very easy with

3059
04:30:22,110 --> 04:30:23,912
forking and pull request.

3060
04:30:23,912 --> 04:30:24,933
What about you, [name]?

3061
04:30:24,933 --> 04:30:27,256
Have you contributed to

3062
04:30:27,256 --> 04:30:29,647
some strangers repository?

3063
04:30:29,647 --> 04:30:34,213
uh yes um i come i've sent

3064
04:30:34,213 --> 04:30:36,937
some uh fixes to some code that

3065
04:30:36,937 --> 04:30:38,258
was in a git repository

3066
04:30:38,258 --> 04:30:40,581
associated with some published papers

3067
04:30:40,581 --> 04:30:44,567
as well as for some code

3068
04:30:44,567 --> 04:30:47,130
that was used in our clinics

3069
04:30:48,752 --> 04:30:53,258
in their some of their utilities cool

3070
04:30:54,352 --> 04:30:57,095
great so hopefully you know

3071
04:30:57,095 --> 04:30:59,057
this motivates all of you who

3072
04:30:59,057 --> 04:31:01,500
are watching to go out find

3073
04:31:01,500 --> 04:31:04,002
little errors typos there's a

3074
04:31:04,002 --> 04:31:05,744
specific type of label what is

3075
04:31:05,744 --> 04:31:07,566
the label easy first issue

3076
04:31:07,566 --> 04:31:08,687
or something like that i

3077
04:31:08,687 --> 04:31:13,072
never remember yes yeah so that

3078
04:31:14,093 --> 04:31:15,614
you can you know take

3079
04:31:15,614 --> 04:31:16,996
a challenge and contribute to

3080
04:31:16,996 --> 04:31:19,619
open source software right is

3081
04:31:19,619 --> 04:31:22,722
there anything to lift up from the notes

3082
04:31:26,262 --> 04:31:28,085
yeah somebody's asking this general

3083
04:31:28,085 --> 04:31:29,428
in the general questions will

3084
04:31:29,428 --> 04:31:31,011
there be exercises or just

3085
04:31:31,011 --> 04:31:33,375
lectures in the next weeks and

3086
04:31:33,375 --> 04:31:34,658
actually this is the main reason

3087
04:31:34,658 --> 04:31:38,124
of the change because in the previous way

3088
04:31:38,124 --> 04:31:40,669
that we did it there were only lectures

3089
04:31:40,669 --> 04:31:41,971
and the exercises were just

3090
04:31:41,971 --> 04:31:44,436
demos but now with having two

3091
04:31:44,436 --> 04:31:45,538
and a half hours for each

3092
04:31:45,538 --> 04:31:48,183
episodes we will have time for exercises

3093
04:31:48,183 --> 04:31:50,925
Which also means that now

3094
04:31:50,925 --> 04:31:53,648
the exercises will use Python.

3095
04:31:53,648 --> 04:31:55,089
It doesn't mean that you need

3096
04:31:55,089 --> 04:31:56,551
to know how to use Python.

3097
04:31:58,953 --> 04:32:00,714
But the goal is just to

3098
04:32:00,714 --> 04:32:04,938
show, for example, how to run some scripts.

3099
04:32:04,938 --> 04:32:07,100
Like, for example, in the next day,

3100
04:32:07,100 --> 04:32:08,721
next Wednesday, we will look

3101
04:32:08,721 --> 04:32:10,964
at a tool called SnakeMake, which

3102
04:32:10,964 --> 04:32:12,625
is a tool for pipelines.

3103
04:32:13,526 --> 04:32:14,967
And then it will run,

3104
04:32:14,967 --> 04:32:18,170
SnakeMake will call some Python scripts.

3105
04:32:18,170 --> 04:32:20,452
and basically long story short

3106
04:32:20,452 --> 04:32:23,335
I'm trying to tell you that we need

3107
04:32:23,335 --> 04:32:25,357
or you need to install conda

3108
04:32:25,357 --> 04:32:26,458
and the conda environment that

3109
04:32:26,458 --> 04:32:27,739
we have defined because then

3110
04:32:27,739 --> 04:32:29,421
through conda it takes care of

3111
04:32:29,421 --> 04:32:31,543
all the python dependencies that you need

3112
04:32:32,744 --> 04:32:34,605
and so please before next Wednesday

3113
04:32:34,605 --> 04:32:35,346
if you plan to do the

3114
04:32:35,346 --> 04:32:37,148
exercises with us here on the

3115
04:32:37,148 --> 04:32:39,230
stream try to have conda on

3116
04:32:39,230 --> 04:32:40,331
your computer if you have

3117
04:32:40,331 --> 04:32:42,433
troubles installing conda just send

3118
04:32:42,433 --> 04:32:43,434
us an email and we can

3119
04:32:43,434 --> 04:32:48,038
arrange even more zoom sessions for hands-on

3120
04:32:48,038 --> 04:32:51,783
installations and someone's asking

3121
04:32:51,783 --> 04:32:53,185
for the requirements link and

3122
04:32:53,185 --> 04:32:58,473
we will post it yeah the i would say

3123
04:32:58,473 --> 04:33:00,055
that in general the language

3124
04:33:00,055 --> 04:33:03,139
agnostic we try to be as general

3125
04:33:03,139 --> 04:33:04,722
as possible then if the examples

3126
04:33:04,722 --> 04:33:06,184
in the end are for python

3127
04:33:06,184 --> 04:33:08,086
and conda conda is actually

3128
04:33:08,086 --> 04:33:09,809
quite a flexible tool itself

3129
04:33:09,809 --> 04:33:12,372
you can manage other environments

3130
04:33:12,372 --> 04:33:14,195
not just python environments

3131
04:33:14,195 --> 04:33:16,517
But of course, some other languages like R,

3132
04:33:16,517 --> 04:33:18,900
for example, also have other

3133
04:33:18,900 --> 04:33:22,444
tools for managing R environments.

3134
04:33:22,444 --> 04:33:23,945
But I'm a bit spoiling the fun here.

3135
04:33:23,945 --> 04:33:24,706
I'm really talking about

3136
04:33:24,706 --> 04:33:26,788
environments without defining environments.

3137
04:33:26,788 --> 04:33:29,191
So, you know, let's resume

3138
04:33:29,191 --> 04:33:31,614
this question next Wednesday.

3139
04:33:35,017 --> 04:33:35,318
Right.

3140
04:33:36,819 --> 04:33:40,783
So I guess we covered everything.

3141
04:33:42,225 --> 04:33:43,206
I don't see any.

3142
04:33:44,519 --> 04:33:45,763
and answer questions.

3143
04:33:45,763 --> 04:33:50,176
Did I forgot anything, [name]?

3144
04:33:52,082 --> 04:33:59,200
I think we've covered everything.

3145
04:33:59,200 --> 04:34:01,443
fine to end a bit ahead of time.

3146
04:34:01,443 --> 04:34:04,206
Yeah, people can get Well, it's Thursday.

3147
04:34:04,206 --> 04:34:06,709
So don't quite start the

3148
04:34:06,709 --> 04:34:08,912
weekend yet unless you have a good reason to.

3149
04:34:08,912 --> 04:34:11,815
But the mode is already towards Friday.

3150
04:34:11,815 --> 04:34:12,856
So yeah.

3151
04:34:13,998 --> 04:34:15,259
And it was a long day.

3152
04:34:15,259 --> 04:34:16,741
And thank you for following

3153
04:34:16,741 --> 04:34:18,503
us and for doing the exercises.

3154
04:34:18,503 --> 04:34:21,086
So what were you saying?

3155
04:34:21,086 --> 04:34:23,169
I do have any questions,

3156
04:34:23,169 --> 04:34:24,671
please feel free to add them

3157
04:34:24,671 --> 04:34:27,466
in the notes and then we can still

3158
04:34:27,466 --> 04:34:29,389
And so to answer any

3159
04:34:29,389 --> 04:34:30,523
further questions today.

3160
04:34:32,562 --> 04:34:33,943
All right, so thanks again

3161
04:34:33,943 --> 04:34:36,686

3162
04:34:36,686 --> 04:34:38,267
and [name], and thank you,

And thank you everyone in

3165

those in-person rooms, managing, learners,

3166
04:34:46,935 --> 04:34:50,418
and whatever, what's the

3167
04:34:50,418 --> 04:34:53,000
word, enthusiastic people about

3168
04:34:53,000 --> 04:34:54,321
Git and version control.

3169
04:34:55,122 --> 04:34:56,743
We can close this Git part

3170
04:34:56,743 --> 04:34:58,364
of the Code Refinery workshop, and

3171
04:34:58,364 --> 04:35:02,448
I will see you in six days.

3172
04:35:02,448 --> 04:35:03,892
Have a good weekend.

3173
04:35:05,176 --> 04:35:05,397
Bye.
