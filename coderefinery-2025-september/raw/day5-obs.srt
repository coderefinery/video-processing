1
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:33,723
Hello, hello.

2
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:36,386
Can you hear us?

3
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:41,272
Let's see if the Zoom or

4
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:45,417
not Zoom, if our Zulip audience is hearing us.

5
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,742
Hello, [name].

6
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:51,103
Hello, [name].

7
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,884
Hello, [name].

8
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,145
Hello, [name].

9
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,162
Hi.

10
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,384
tried to make the title

11
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:58,466
visible and I clicked on

12
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,967
the wrong slider again.

13
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,230
So the sound might be

14
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,292
slightly different from the way it was before.

15
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,273
I wonder what the number

16
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,736
was originally, but everyone can

17
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:08,517
adjust the volume.

18
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:11,160
So this point is probably fine.

19
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,141
I'll just keep it the way

20
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,223
it is for the rest of the session.

21
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,125
Can people hear us though?

22
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,728
Did you check this?

23
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:19,069
Okay.

24
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:22,132
Anyone on Twitch, Zulip, can you hear us?

25
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:22,232
Yeah.

26
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:30,586
so basically we are at day five

27
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:34,111
as usual if you were

28
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,254
already in the previous four days

29
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:38,356
of this code refinery workshop

30
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,819
you might already know how we

31
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,261
are going to operate together

32
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:43,703
so you're watching the twitch

33
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:45,946
tv stream and then there

34
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,588
is this collaborative document that

35
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:49,330
i'm showing right now

36
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,615
and there in this collaborative document

37
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:53,637
if you were not pressing

38
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:54,879
the previous days it's actually

39
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,864
very intuitive system at the very

40
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:01,310
top there is a pencil and

41
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,893
so for example now let's go to

42
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,435
the very top you might not

43
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:08,602
see my pencil but it's okay

44
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,103
All right.

45
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:09,703
Okay.

46
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,725
So you see there's a pencil.

47
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:14,088
I click the pencil and there

48
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,489
the page turns into like

49
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:19,133
an editor and basically you can just edit.

50
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:22,336
And so I added a

51
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,638
couple of icebreaker questions.

52
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,420
How is the weather at your location?

53
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:29,663
I think it was quite cold this morning.

54
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,661
Is it that you're in Oslo [name], right?

55
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,184
I'm not sure how it's in Oslo,

56
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:37,448
but Trondheim was, I used

57
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:40,354
clothes on my bike here to office today.

58
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,778
So I see it's starting

59
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,001
to getting colder here.

60
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:48,229
And last weekend, I think there

61
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:52,256
was snow in the mountains around 900 meters.

62
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,582
So winter is coming.

63
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,284
Winter is coming.

64
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:57,657
Definitely.

65
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:58,778
even though it's what the

66
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:01,702
second day of autumn but anyway

67
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,905
so those of you who are online

68
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,208
you can open this notes document

69
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,550
i guess you just received an

70
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,773
email with the with the notes document

71
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,036
so and basically write down

72
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:15,698
the weather but maybe more

73
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:17,260
interesting and i can ask this

74
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,983
question also to the others here in the room

75
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:23,049
I'm sure you have shared some

76
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,074
of your code or maybe you helped because

77
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,096
both of you are research

78
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,820
software engineers and maybe you

79
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,625
helped some researchers writing some

80
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,426
code for them.

81
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,215
So how do you usually give

82
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,139
codes to others, for example, [name]?

83
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:44,898
Yeah, well, I think I mostly emailed

84
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,185
or pasted into I can

85
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,371
on GitLab issues example code

86
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:55,879
and I haven't licensed it in any way just

87
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:58,522
I haven't said whether I had

88
00:12:58,522 --> 00:12:59,744
gotten it from either.

89
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,713
But it's been mostly snippets of code.

90
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,758
And I think that's quite common

91
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:12,184
in all of just in university setting

92
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:14,368
and also the software industry

93
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:17,653
that small snippets of codes

94
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:20,418
are shared and copied.

95
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:22,721
Yeah.

96
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:23,723
What about you, JÃ¶rn?

97
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,119
Well, I mean, I'm a

98
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,120
research software engineer.

99
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,963
It's my job to share code with researchers.

100
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:33,047
So essentially whatever they

101
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:37,493
want, usually Git on GitHub or

102
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:39,075
a local GitLab instance.

103
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:46,285
Also attachments and email.

104
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,522
shared folders.

105
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:49,923
What else?

106
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:52,953
I haven't used a thumb drive

107
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,277
yet in this job.

108
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:57,066
I have in previous jobs, like a USB drive.

109
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:00,895
Whatever works, whatever they can use.

110
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:01,476
is the best.

111
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,698
But of course, I prefer to use Git

112
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:05,719
and publish it so I can

113
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,181
make it available for everyone.

114
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,805
But then is it that when you give the code,

115
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,426
let's say that you, I don't

116
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,788
know, write the function or a script

117
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,411
for someone you're helping,

118
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:21,133
do you explicitly tell them

119
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:21,994
you can do whatever you want

120
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,936
with this code or you need

121
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:28,840
to cite my whatever copyright?

122
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,183
um if i make it public then

123
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:35,728
i use a license um but not explicitly

124
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,010
because we are i mean

125
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,752
we are essentially always been

126
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,174
working at the same university

127
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:44,018
and been collaborating on the code

128
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,120
so it's um the university owns

129
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,203
the code to some extent but

130
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:49,344
it's a good point like if

131
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:50,425
they want to publish it at

132
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:51,887
some point then in principle they

133
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:53,168
would need to ask my permission

134
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,771
which you if i have given you

135
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,053
some code you have my permission

136
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,054
to publish it but

137
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:00,189
This is not the best

138
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,431
channel for doing that.

139
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:03,913
I guess we'll come to that later.

140
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,034
And this is exactly basically

141
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,697
the topic of today that

142
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,419
sometimes you might even share,

143
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,800
okay, this is the bit of

144
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,742
code that whatever this postdoc

145
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,405
before me was using, and now I

146
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,226
pass it on to you.

147
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,009
And maybe it's all fine

148
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,070
and there's no issues, but

149
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,311
you can understand that maybe

150
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:24,975
is this whatever mysterious postdoc,

151
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,177
are they going to be cited?

152
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,281
or at least you know will

153
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:30,463
there be some mentions that

154
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,966
they actually were the original

155
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,553
writers of the code so this

156
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:38,038
is what we will basically cover

157
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,703
in this topic today which is

158
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,386
a kind of an interesting topic

159
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:44,390
because it's a mixture of

160
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,253
kind of legal reasons that

161
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,675
sometimes you you know you need

162
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,897
to be in order with the law

163
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,559
when you share the code or

164
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,361
use somebody else's code but then

165
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,523
it goes also towards more ethics that

166
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,245
if you you know if someone

167
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:01,026
was helping you it's good to

168
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,808
mention that this person was

169
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:08,614
helping you right so anything else

170
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:09,655
do you want to mention

171
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:17,892
Yeah, I worked for a startup

172
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:20,656
once that was acquired by Sun Microsystems.

173
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,820
And then there was a

174
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,263
huge due diligence process.

175
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:30,028
And one of the major things

176
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,851
was the source code of the

177
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:33,333
product that they were buying.

178
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,198
Where did this source code come from?

179
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,542
And it was developed in-house,

180
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,565
but they more or less went

181
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:45,241
through all of the code to make sure that

182
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,865
there wasn't parts that were copied from,

183
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:50,328
especially open source GPL

184
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:56,256
products or projects.

185
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,741
So they had a very

186
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:04,248
thorough process going through all

187
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:06,311
of the source code to make sure

188
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:10,877
that it was in fact written in-house.

189
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,502
yeah i agree and this

190
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,505
is also sometimes important that

191
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:18,209
maybe some of you might now

192
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,652
just starting to share code some

193
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,894
of you have been sharing

194
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:22,676
code and writing whatever

195
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:25,240
libraries extensions for for many

196
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,063
years you never know where

197
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:28,846
your code might actually end up

198
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:30,829
and then this type of

199
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,735
commercial slash legal issues might

200
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,997
you know, maybe even come

201
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:40,862
back in a positive sense that maybe, you know,

202
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:44,285
you get famous and hired

203
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:47,609
by whatever larger company in the world

204
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,771
or maybe, you know, as

205
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,333
most likely happens with researchers,

206
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:55,797
you will never see any penny out of your coat.

207
00:17:55,797 --> 00:18:00,082
But, you know, let's try to keep positive.

208
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:04,770
Alright, so let me check the clock

209
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,252
and the clock is saying that

210
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:14,025
in 20 seconds it's time to start.

211
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:17,331
I can switch back to the view mode.

212
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:23,820
and i guess we can now

213
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,124
start so good afternoon everyone

214
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:30,927
and welcome to episode 5 of

215
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:34,330
the code refinery workshop and

216
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,873
we have already covered so far

217
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:39,334
in the first part three

218
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:42,797
consecutive days all that is related to git

219
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:44,819
and also github and how to

220
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,861
work with git locally and how

221
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,123
to work with other people

222
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:51,365
and collaborate with them through github

223
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:54,892
in the fourth day we then

224
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,034
had a look at kind of at

225
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,537
the core topic of

226
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,222
reproducibility specifically computational

227
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,388
reproducibility and today we kind

228
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,452
of build on top of this

229
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:09,860
previous part but we kind of add some sort of

230
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,866
how can i call it like a legal angle

231
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,131
but also ethical angle on

232
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:18,618
how to reuse other people's code but also

233
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,862
how to tell others that how

234
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,405
they can reuse our core how

235
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:26,233
can basically we get cited so

236
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,718
with me today there is [name]

237
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:32,033
lindy hi [name] hi [name]

238
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,575
And [name] is a research

239
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:38,583
software engineer at NTNU, am I right?

240
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,306
Did I spell it right?

241
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:42,108
Norwegian University of Technology

242
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,510
and Science, yes.

243
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,173
So do you want to briefly mention

244
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:48,137
how is your normal day at

245
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:50,663
work and what do you do at NTNU?

246
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,946
Yeah, you see the logo behind me here.

247
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:54,767
It's Endris.

248
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,950
It's Norwegian research infrastructure.

249
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,734
So that's a lot with data storage and HPC.

250
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,816
So last week I had a

251
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:05,638
full support week on the

252
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,061
national supercomputing systems.

253
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:14,587
So my job is to support

254
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:17,950
on HPC systems, but also support

255
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,836
research software locally at

256
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,405
the university.

257
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,868
Yes, it's nice that in this

258
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:27,071
run of the Code Refinery workshop,

259
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:30,656
we had many people actually involved with HPC.

260
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:34,982
And in general, for those of you

261
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,304
who are affiliated with

262
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,766
the university, most likely you

263
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,628
have access to an HPC cluster,

264
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,210
whether it's the university cluster

265
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,352
or some national cluster.

266
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:44,915
And this is something that

267
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:47,098
maybe you want to bring at

268
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:50,823
some point into your workflows.

269
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:52,465
But anyway, I'm now sharing,

270
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:55,768
I'm now showing this, how do

271
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,530
you call it, the homepage of

272
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,532
the workshop and today's day five.

273
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:00,853
So if you click on the

274
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:03,636
link that there says social coding,

275
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:08,100
this will be the materials for today.

276
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,682
A quick reminder when it comes

277
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,604
to the intro that we have

278
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,286
been using this notes document

279
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,890
that you should have just received via email.

280
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,897
and so if you open this

281
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:22,642
notes document in a browser

282
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:25,669
window there's a pencil at the very top

283
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:26,692
so if you click on the

284
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:30,261
pencil you can basically edit

285
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:32,587
the document and ask questions

286
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,153
or interact with us in the studio

287
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,115
and especially today the

288
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:39,217
notes document will be very important

289
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:41,959
because the exercises that we

290
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,220
will have they're not going

291
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,282
to be writing code, running

292
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,444
code or running some git

293
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:49,106
commands the exercises will be

294
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,927
kind of discussion based exercises

295
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:52,048
that will happen on the notes

296
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:55,591
so please everyone open your

297
00:21:55,591 --> 00:21:59,035
notes document and of course

298
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:02,798
any questions you can write them here

299
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,868
You can see how I can add.

300
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,598
All right, but let's then

301
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,626
get actually started with the topic of today.

302
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,895
So social coding, it's nice that the name,

303
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,139
I remember the first time I

304
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:21,104
took the Code Refinery workshop,

305
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:22,748
and heard about this social

306
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,573
coding, I thought, is this

307
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:26,698
about, I don't know, sitting in

308
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:28,703
the same room and coding together or,

309
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:32,272
you know, but later I

310
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:33,736
kind of understood that it's

311
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:37,726
more related to the fact that we are not

312
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:41,109
isolated coders that most likely

313
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,533
we work in a system whether

314
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,796
we reuse other people code or

315
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:49,358
whether we create code that

316
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:51,700
our people will reuse or often

317
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,942
we belong to a team for

318
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:56,525
example a research group and it might be

319
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:57,686
that maybe you're the only one

320
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:59,068
who codes there or maybe

321
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,749
there's someone else who's coding

322
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,071
there and you need to share

323
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:04,934
or you know reproduce what

324
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,315
other people have been doing

325
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,251
So in general, in this

326
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,755
lesson, we will discuss kind of how

327
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,757
and why to share code, but

328
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:16,082
also data, which is important.

329
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,784
And when it comes to sharing code

330
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:19,506
and data, you will hear

331
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:22,029
often the concept of licenses

332
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,352
that are basically kind of like contracts

333
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,617
that are defining the rules on

334
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,219
how do we share what we

335
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:32,523
created and how do we reuse

336
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:35,627
what someone else has created.

337
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:38,734
so again here it mentions

338
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,518
the FAIR principles this was

339
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:42,641
also we touched on the FAIR

340
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:45,046
principle last week last wednesday

341
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:46,769
which is this findable

342
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:50,275
accessible interoperable and reusable

343
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,418
four principles that are

344
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:54,523
basically making sure that the

345
00:23:54,523 --> 00:23:59,232
code but also the data can be reused and

346
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,540
in a way that is legal ethical

347
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,866
and kind of you know sustainable

348
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:06,429
so that other people can build

349
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,354
on top of your work like

350
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:09,898
most likely in your research

351
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,141
work you're building on top

352
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:13,647
of existing research

353
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:18,423
So why software licenses matter?

354
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,707
Well, you find for example

355
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:23,212
some great code or data that

356
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,758
you want to reuse and you kind

357
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:30,925
of want to give credit to whoever wrote

358
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:33,009
that code or published the data

359
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,371
so that you can actually cite,

360
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,475
like you would normally cite a publication.

361
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,637
but then sometimes you might

362
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:38,819
need to modify the code a

363
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,142
little bit to adapt it to your

364
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:42,246
case it's kind of we will

365
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:45,171
often talk about remixing bits of code

366
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:46,914
or bits of data and then it

367
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,459
might be a bit less less clear

368
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:50,742
how much can you change are

369
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:51,964
you allowed to change can you

370
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:53,847
do whatever you want and so

371
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:55,871
for for clarifying this basically

372
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,143
we have licenses

373
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:02,711
I mentioned that if you're

374
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,035
citing a paper, then there's no license.

375
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,878
You can easily build on

376
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:10,144
other people's research or doing

377
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,986
your own research.

378
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,532
But when it comes to software,

379
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:16,916
you have to be careful because

380
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,202
you have to know that you can build on it.

381
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah that's true that in a

382
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,444
way I mean of course the equivalent is

383
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:27,487
that I might write things

384
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:29,250
in the paper without actually

385
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,654
citing you know the original source

386
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:34,059
who wrote some statement and maybe

387
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,823
that is not illegal but it's

388
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:38,206
kind of you know in the

389
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:40,650
point of research ethics it's

390
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,952
you know you can't just

391
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:44,296
copy paste somebody else's paper

392
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:47,282
and plagiarize but with

393
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,625
code there's another layer like

394
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,526
like like you just said

395
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:50,949
there's another layer of difficulty

396
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,595
that immediately from from the

397
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,478
first day can i just reuse

398
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:57,122
this bit of code that i

399
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,548
found online on stackoverflow or

400
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:02,492
or like we will see later

401
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:05,899
that some chat gpt has made for me

402
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,379
So hopefully we will

403
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,302
basically clarify this.

404
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:12,887
So maybe very briefly, because

405
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:16,433
before I pass the microphone to [name],

406
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,317
in general, maybe today is

407
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:19,819
a little bit more for those of you

408
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,765
who are actually coding reusable

409
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,248
code so that you can share

410
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:26,652
it and other people can use it.

411
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:30,117
but in general this will

412
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:32,480
be important knowledge for anyone

413
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,043
who has to work with coders

414
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:37,246
whether in a research environment

415
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:39,389
or maybe later in your life if you go

416
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,333
even outside academia so in

417
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,076
general we will try to cover

418
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:45,558
the basics but also practical

419
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:48,362
stuff related to all these aspects

420
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,526
so I move to the

421
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,511
social coding page and I pass the

422
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,136
so [name] what are the

423
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,459
objectives of this first part

424
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:02,961
of the lesson yeah thank

425
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:07,147
you [name] the objectives of

426
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,410
the social coding is that we're

427
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,672
going to get an overview

428
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:14,237
of motivations and benefits but

429
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:16,740
also risks of sharing and reusing code

430
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,861
we'll learn to identify whether

431
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,884
you can use other people's software.

432
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,329
And then we can start

433
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:28,411
out with a discussion, a poll.

434
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,117
We'll paste in the four

435
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,919
questions into the shared document.

436
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:37,464
Yes, I just pasted them.

437
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:40,188
Yeah, so you can ponder on this

438
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:41,770
for 10 minutes and then

439
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,677
we'll discuss them together.

440
00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:51,123
so let's have a exercise

441
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:53,790
where it's this social one 10

442
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:01,408
minutes so we can be back in 19 past

443
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:28,629
Hi everybody.

444
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:29,450
Welcome back again.

445
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,972
I hope you had a good

446
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:33,634
time answering the questions.

447
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:37,698
We'll take a look at your

448
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:38,979
answers and your votes.

449
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:44,905
So starting with question one,

450
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:46,747
why would you want to share

451
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:49,190
your scripts code data?

452
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,313
And we see many votes for

453
00:37:53,894 --> 00:37:57,018
easier to find and reproducibility.

454
00:37:57,018 --> 00:37:57,518
That's good.

455
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:01,080
and increased trustworthiness.

456
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:06,394
Others can verify and find bugs.

457
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,662
Enable others to build your

458
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,905
own portfolio code.

459
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,597
Others can submit improvements

460
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:16,519
and help fixing.

461
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,271
um we say that there's

462
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,458
less there's just one vote

463
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,041
on the scarring competitors

464
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:28,949
and that's interesting um uh uh

465
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:36,224
i i i'm impressed by a

466
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:39,230
library like armadillo which is a liner

467
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,854
algebra c++ library and I

468
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,197
think they kind of take up the space

469
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,940
for others and they use

470
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,406
Apache 2 license what do you think [name]?

471
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,351
of this first question in general?

472
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:01,074
no this yeah the response on

473
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:03,257
h the letter h in the first

474
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,778
question oh yeah the

475
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:08,137
discouraging the competitors well I don't know

476
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,341
It's interesting that there's just

477
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:16,307
one vote for that, but it's true

478
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:20,653
that sometimes competition in academia

479
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,796
and science is quite, you

480
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:28,302
know, people cut corners and if, you know,

481
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:29,725
But on the other hand, we

482
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:32,229
are often drive by good ethical principles,

483
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:36,256
so maybe it's nice to see at least

484
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:37,479
that this is reflected in

485
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,302
the audience here that the

486
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:43,950
majority are openly sharing or

487
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,595
to ensure reproducibility and trustworthiness.

488
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:50,423
Me personally, I never

489
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:52,807
thought of discouraging competitors.

490
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,092
I'm actually encouraging competitors

491
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:59,421
to find errors in my scripts.

492
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,385
Has it ever happened to you that someone

493
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:05,288
It's quite rare, but it's

494
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,712
not impossible that someone has found

495
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:11,077
a bug or something in your published code.

496
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,625
No, not my code.

497
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:19,291
I haven't published that much code.

498
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,673
It's just been more or

499
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:23,197
less snippets to individuals.

500
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:27,384
It also goes to the fact

501
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,586
what someone was writing the

502
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:30,469
extra questions at the bottom

503
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,213
that do reviewers like peer

504
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,036
reviewers actually review also the

505
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:36,619
code of the paper because you

506
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,122
know in theory people can find

507
00:40:38,122 --> 00:40:39,183
bug in your code but if

508
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:43,290
nobody's gonna review it it's you know.

509
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:47,517
Yeah and

510
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,632
a real instructor from the

511
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,596
previous lessons from the East

512
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:55,720
University of Finland.

513
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,321
Yeah.

514
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:56,842
Yeah.

515
00:40:56,842 --> 00:40:57,343
No.

516
00:40:57,343 --> 00:40:58,225
What's she called?

517
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,696
You know, she had published a

518
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:05,860
paper on that together with others.

519
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,495
where it showed that it was

520
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:13,084
pretty, it was not good when

521
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:16,030
it comes to reproducing results

522
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:20,018
and using published software.

523
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,173
Right, so question two.

524
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,984
Yeah, that that's what's

525
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:34,011
the concerning thing for me or for you.

526
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,899
And then we see that exposing

527
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:43,592
ugly code is Is very

528
00:41:45,412 --> 00:41:52,764
present I have less problems now

529
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:55,789
than previously I do horrible

530
00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:01,278
things on github publicly just using it

531
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:03,722
if I have a learning project

532
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,647
I establish it on github so at

533
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:10,153
least I have it I don't mind having it publicly

534
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,191
I have the personal

535
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:15,874
motivational factor that from day zero,

536
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:17,436
I start coding as if

537
00:42:18,418 --> 00:42:21,041
everything that I'm coding is public.

538
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,324
So then, even though I might not even,

539
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:24,586
you know, push it to any GitHub

540
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,789
or something, but already knowing this,

541
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:28,571
that someone is watching me,

542
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:29,493
then it's like, you know,

543
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:30,714
I named the variables with

544
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,517
meaningful names, not just A, B,

545
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:35,401
C, and D, and try to add

546
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,083
some comments that, you know,

547
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:40,146
which is in general, at the

548
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:41,067
end of the day, it's not

549
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:42,388
going to help maybe anyone else.

550
00:42:42,388 --> 00:42:44,310
It's more going to help me in a week

551
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,352
or in a month to actually

552
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:48,394
know what I was doing if the

553
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:51,156
code is not that terribly ugly.

554
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,622
But question three and four

555
00:42:56,622 --> 00:43:02,747
are more interesting and more nuanced.

556
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,949
Is there anything that you

557
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,470
picked from question three, BjÃ¶rk?

558
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,102
Yeah, the first ones, I have no idea.

559
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:19,454
What's your opinion on this question?

560
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:20,936
Is software treated differently

561
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:22,058
from papers?

562
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,581
It's definitely treated differently.

563
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:27,444
I mean, papers are the things

564
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:30,148
you get your CVs and credit

565
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:34,613
from, much less so with software.

566
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:44,920
yeah but we see that there

567
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,704
are some answers around that

568
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:50,588
papers are usually one-time publications

569
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:56,316
and software is constantly

570
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:59,461
being improved but then of

571
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:01,123
course one could also argue that

572
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:03,106
I might, and it has

573
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:04,167
happened to me actually, I

574
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,228
have published some software with

575
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,690
some paper, but then they never

576
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,532
went back to that software.

577
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:10,875
So in the end, it's

578
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,417
whatever, you know, version used to

579
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,398
be 10 years ago.

580
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,322
So nobody in a way should

581
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,124
be forced to keep the

582
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:22,988
software maintained and improved.

583
00:44:22,988 --> 00:44:25,150
Like with papers, they were

584
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,714
not supposed to go back and suggest edits or

585
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:32,114
And you have here some

586
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:33,316
code might consider a

587
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:35,719
research infrastructure more than

588
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,721
a research output.

589
00:44:39,364 --> 00:44:42,148
But if code, code have to

590
00:44:42,148 --> 00:44:44,952
be maintained and will be improved.

591
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:48,918
So these add-ons and changes

592
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,945
are often results of research.

593
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,713
Someone did this metaphor.

594
00:45:00,892 --> 00:45:02,917
yeah that software is like

595
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:07,027
a recorded song so like basically

596
00:45:07,027 --> 00:45:08,531
what a dj would do instead

597
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:11,137
the papers i like this you

598
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:14,425
know written notes sheet music

599
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:18,475
you can just copy the notes you must create the

600
00:45:18,475 --> 00:45:21,520
original composition but building

601
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,423
for the ideas yeah yeah

602
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:25,267
it's an interesting metaphor i

603
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,669
have to think about it if

604
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:31,958
it works in our context but it's right

605
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:36,005
what about question four yeah

606
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:37,367
when you find a repository

607
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,671
with code would you like to use

608
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,935
it what are you looking for yes

609
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:45,086
Usually go from a paper to

610
00:45:45,086 --> 00:45:46,868
the code and then check

611
00:45:46,868 --> 00:45:48,671
whether you understand the code.

612
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,792
Yes, that's possible.

613
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:54,318
I would check for the dates

614
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,520
that things are committed.

615
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:02,991
And also see if there

616
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:06,235
are frequent updates to the software.

617
00:46:07,717 --> 00:46:09,178
What about you, [name]?

618
00:46:09,178 --> 00:46:11,100
Yeah, I mean, I agree with

619
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,521
what the people brought here.

620
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:13,722
Especially this, I find it

621
00:46:13,722 --> 00:46:15,804
really important that it's maintained.

622
00:46:15,804 --> 00:46:17,125
I know that sometimes there's

623
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,167
very specific software that maybe

624
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,689
has not been updated in five years,

625
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:23,951
but because there's just that

626
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:24,972
and you specifically need to

627
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:27,194
use that, you know, what can you do?

628
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,076
But if I'm choosing between libraries

629
00:46:30,076 --> 00:46:31,458
that might do something similar,

630
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,220
I'd rather go for the one that

631
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,881
I can see in their GitHub

632
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,703
or GitLab repository that they

633
00:46:37,703 --> 00:46:39,286
that a few weeks ago

634
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:41,311
they were doing changes and things like

635
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:44,698
that so definitely the last

636
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,321
point here tests that's a good

637
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:49,508
one tests which shows you how

638
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:52,354
software can be used so that's very good

639
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:56,671
But what we now and then

640
00:46:56,671 --> 00:47:00,719
experience on HPC system is that you take,

641
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,063
download the software, install it,

642
00:47:03,063 --> 00:47:04,486
run the tests, and there are

643
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:08,954
200 tests and 175 of them passes.

644
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,812
What do you do then?

645
00:47:10,812 --> 00:47:15,238
Yeah, this is a very important aspect

646
00:47:15,238 --> 00:47:16,820
that me, for example, I

647
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,584
rarely consider that, okay, this

648
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:21,627
library does what I want, just

649
00:47:21,627 --> 00:47:24,271
import and use, but it's

650
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:25,493
true, it's very important.

651
00:47:29,538 --> 00:47:34,565
All right, so now if we

652
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:37,149
go back to the lesson, so

653
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:40,093
what about these two pictures here, [name]?

654
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:45,862
Yeah, well, we know that we can cite others

655
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,605
papers and from all this

656
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:50,807
research, we get new ideas.

657
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:54,571
And so that's, if you have

658
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,294
a PhD, you don't start out from scratch.

659
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:02,220
With PhD, if you are a PhD student

660
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,022
and a part of a PhD

661
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:06,664
program, you don't start out from scratch.

662
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:09,588
Somebody has written more or

663
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:11,450
less the task for you.

664
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,514
And so you have to read a lot of papers and

665
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,170
often cite these papers at

666
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,332
your progress in your work.

667
00:48:25,256 --> 00:48:27,979
Doing the same thing with software is,

668
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:34,106
well, we should probably cite software,

669
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:36,749
but you could then have

670
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:39,191
either that your code are part

671
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:41,532
of what others do or

672
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:48,720
And then you have to relate to others

673
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,181
that send you improvements of

674
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:55,447
your code and others that also

675
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:56,729
want to cite your code.

676
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:04,717
So this is somewhat different

677
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:09,042
than citing a paper which has a much more

678
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,897
a natural natural a common

679
00:49:12,897 --> 00:49:18,071
and established way of of doing

680
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:23,605
it what about like if we consider

681
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:26,555
Because, for example, journal policies,

682
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:29,639
I've been at least changing

683
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:30,801
a little bit, for example, when

684
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,323
it comes to sharing data.

685
00:49:32,323 --> 00:49:34,106
Now many journals require a

686
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:37,872
so-called data availability statement.

687
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:39,794
What about the code?

688
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:41,277
Can this be a motivation

689
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:43,160
for sharing the code?

690
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,823
Yeah, I think this can be

691
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:47,649
a motivation for sharing the code, absolutely.

692
00:49:49,312 --> 00:49:51,837
But then, as studies have

693
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:55,725
shown, it's not always possible

694
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:58,169
to reuse the code, though it's shared.

695
00:49:59,612 --> 00:50:02,097
Things stop despite being shared.

696
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,395
But we see here both Science

697
00:50:06,395 --> 00:50:09,221
and Nature has editorial policies

698
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:12,589
for sharing code.

699
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:14,814
And Nature has also

700
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:17,099
requirements for sharing the data.

701
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,765
And that can be a lot,

702
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:21,048
quite a large volume.

703
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:23,173
Yeah.

704
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:28,051
And so here in the bottom of the page,

705
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:30,333
we have this motivation for

706
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:33,036
open source software, but also

707
00:50:33,036 --> 00:50:35,898
this type of scaring aspects.

708
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:37,600
I guess that most people kind of,

709
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,742
this was already mentioned by

710
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:41,424
many in question one.

711
00:50:41,424 --> 00:50:42,845
Yes, it was.

712
00:50:42,845 --> 00:50:46,909
And also when it came to what's scary,

713
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:48,650
being scoped and also published

714
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:53,835
the ugly code was quite many thought of.

715
00:50:58,085 --> 00:50:59,290
And the scare that someone

716
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,319
might find bugs or mistake.

717
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,690
Also somebody that's on the phone.

718
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:06,206
On the other hand, one

719
00:51:06,206 --> 00:51:08,248
could even consider that actually

720
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:08,789
it's a good thing.

721
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,132
I mean, maybe it's not a

722
00:51:11,132 --> 00:51:12,653
good thing from the perspective

723
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,395
of a researcher that, okay, well,

724
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:15,817
there was a bug in my code

725
00:51:15,817 --> 00:51:18,981
and now all my papers are wrong.

726
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:20,162
I need to retract them all.

727
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:20,823
But then on the other hand,

728
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:23,667
from the point of view of science

729
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,470
and research, it's good that

730
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,172
some bug was actually found.

731
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:30,775
Yes, yes.

732
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:39,278
it's a double-edged sword exactly yeah

733
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:41,100
what about this and this

734
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,744
maybe also comes um comes also

735
00:51:44,744 --> 00:51:47,126
with the fact that if i now

736
00:51:47,126 --> 00:51:48,187
look also at the research

737
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:49,809
software engineers that sometimes we

738
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,951
need to help researchers to

739
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:54,614
reuse somebody else's code but the person

740
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:56,195
who maybe invented that code

741
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:57,617
created that code they're not

742
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,639
supporting it they're not you

743
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:02,041
know sometimes you can't even ask them

744
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,906
so is this also something

745
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:06,449
that maybe people don't want

746
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:07,691
to share their code because they

747
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,136
will feel this pressure that

748
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:12,780
forever they will need to support

749
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,125
the code and answer to

750
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:18,551
frequent questions around the code

751
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:19,813
yeah yes that can be

752
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:29,274
all right so then basically at

753
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:32,467
the end is code reusability

754
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:35,760
so what contributes to reusability

755
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:41,434
Yeah, we partly discussed it,

756
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:46,241
but that it's licensed and

757
00:52:47,162 --> 00:52:48,804
so you are allowed to use it.

758
00:52:49,726 --> 00:52:51,508
And that we will discuss a

759
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:54,032
little bit later on which license to choose.

760
00:52:56,776 --> 00:52:58,639
Install the instructions or tests

761
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,042
so we can show how the

762
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:03,165
software is used or the code is used.

763
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:07,577
And that it's not 10 years old,

764
00:53:07,577 --> 00:53:13,308
but updated with issues and

765
00:53:13,308 --> 00:53:16,273
requests and commits.

766
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:24,327
Yeah.

767
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:26,936
Well, maybe we don't need

768
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,618
to do this exercise here because

769
00:53:28,618 --> 00:53:29,859
maybe this is a bit more

770
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,123
kind of a reflection on this type of issues

771
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,725
that we discussed that you

772
00:53:35,725 --> 00:53:37,467
aren't required to support anyone,

773
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:38,588
that it's important to publish

774
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:40,390
the code, even though, you

775
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,191
know, maybe you will never touch

776
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:45,555
it again, but to wrap up this page.

777
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,778
So, so yeah.

778
00:53:48,778 --> 00:53:49,339
What do you want to

779
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:51,681
mention, [name], before we move to the next one?

780
00:53:53,737 --> 00:53:57,603
yes here is the here we see whether

781
00:53:57,603 --> 00:53:59,787
and what we can share depends on

782
00:53:59,787 --> 00:54:02,031
how we obtain the components

783
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:06,839
but here is your work kind of

784
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:08,742
used in us as a source as

785
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:13,789
a software used by others

786
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:18,117
to write articles and promote ideas.

787
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,752
And your work is also dependent on others.

788
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:28,951
So to promote science and

789
00:54:33,697 --> 00:54:34,899
create more bang for the

790
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:38,483
buck, it's important that software

791
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,868
are citable and licensed for others to use.

792
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:47,735
And this is what we will

793
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:49,798
cover basically in the rest

794
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:51,520
of these hours together.

795
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:53,194
Right.

796
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:56,018
So if I click next and turn the page,

797
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:58,001
now we finally introduce

798
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:00,164
software licensing.

799
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:02,447
And well, the idea here is

800
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:07,254
to kind of know about the

801
00:55:07,254 --> 00:55:09,157
type of basically derivative work,

802
00:55:09,157 --> 00:55:12,442
the type of reuse of remix that you can do.

803
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,444
with others people software and

804
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,066
of course how can you share

805
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,688
what you've done and now can

806
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:20,452
you also you know get uh

807
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:23,435
you know citations from from this

808
00:55:23,435 --> 00:55:28,081
from the work that you do and more generally

809
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:29,022
as i was mentioning earlier

810
00:55:29,022 --> 00:55:30,584
it's important to get familiar

811
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:31,925
with the terminology it might be

812
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:32,926
that it's not something that you

813
00:55:32,926 --> 00:55:34,969
need today it might be that

814
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,691
you will have helpers at your

815
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:38,694
research organization or even in

816
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:40,336
a company when it comes to

817
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,479
this type of issues that start

818
00:55:42,479 --> 00:55:44,843
to become legal issues but

819
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,527
in general it's important that you

820
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:49,349
are aware of these things if

821
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:53,816
you work with software so in

822
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,498
when it comes to copyright so

823
00:55:55,498 --> 00:55:57,341
copyright is a type of

824
00:55:57,341 --> 00:56:00,466
intellectual property rights and

825
00:56:00,466 --> 00:56:01,307
there are different types

826
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:03,029
of intellectual property rights

827
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,513
more related to kind of

828
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:09,517
trademark or bad events or, you know,

829
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:12,561
kind of, you know, this type of

830
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:16,084
how to protect ideas or

831
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,287
better to protect implementation of ideas.

832
00:56:19,128 --> 00:56:21,690
But if you write a piece

833
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,133
of software, then it's you

834
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:26,395
as implementer that has the

835
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:29,219
copyright to the code.

836
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,521
It's not the university, right?

837
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:34,835
Well, I've been hanging around

838
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:35,996
too much with lawyers, so

839
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:38,419
they would always say, it depends.

840
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:43,105
But at least in all the universities

841
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:45,988
that I've seen, the deal is

842
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:47,970
this, that yes, you have the

843
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,613
copyright of the code.

844
00:56:50,613 --> 00:56:52,235
I've seen sometimes people writing

845
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:53,978
in the license copyright by

846
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:56,340
name and surname, and I

847
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,462
don't know, Aalto University.

848
00:56:58,363 --> 00:56:59,564
So that it's like, I did

849
00:56:59,564 --> 00:57:01,927
this work when I was at Aalto University,

850
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:04,270
and you share the copyright

851
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:08,295
but in general when it comes to

852
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:13,081
how can I say to the copyright

853
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:15,764
of an idea of an algorithm

854
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,787
those are something that they

855
00:57:17,787 --> 00:57:19,509
basically you can't read the

856
00:57:19,509 --> 00:57:21,752
copyright in this legal sense you

857
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:22,953
can't put the patent

858
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:24,395
so that in general

859
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:26,178
copyright and intellectual property

860
00:57:26,178 --> 00:57:28,782
rights they try to protect systems

861
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:31,065
so the specific implementation

862
00:57:31,065 --> 00:57:32,928
of an algorithm of a

863
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:35,091
software embedded maybe in other

864
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:38,796
parts of a digital system infrastructure

865
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:41,040
and that you can patent it

866
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,403
and copyright it but if it's

867
00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:46,468
they just invent a new method

868
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:49,953
and it's just a pseudo code algorithms that's

869
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:52,496
kind of not copyrightable but

870
00:57:52,496 --> 00:57:55,821
then it's the i just added

871
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:59,786
this well here it's um here

872
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:01,248
the page starts talking about

873
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:04,092
the concept of derivative work meaning

874
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:06,836
that sometimes we want to like like

875
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:07,998
when we write paper that we

876
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:09,520
want might want to reuse what

877
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,823
other people did and we might want to cite them

878
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,246
The same is also with software

879
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:17,029
that luckily we don't have

880
00:58:17,029 --> 00:58:18,450
to always rewrite all the

881
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:22,695
libraries from scratch and any

882
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:26,239
bits of whatever we need to

883
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:28,481
do with our data can actually

884
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:30,824
be a combination of reusing

885
00:58:30,824 --> 00:58:33,146
existing libraries that other people

886
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:34,107
have made public.

887
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:37,050
And of course the question for us

888
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,313
as users of various libraries

889
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:41,455
that are building code is to understand

890
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,060
Okay, I built some software

891
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,764
that requires kind of installing

892
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:48,387
or calling these other libraries.

893
00:58:48,387 --> 00:58:49,830
Am I allowed to do that?

894
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:52,514
Can I then share my code

895
00:58:52,514 --> 00:58:53,476
that is built on that?

896
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:56,181
Do I need to cite the

897
00:58:56,181 --> 00:58:59,326
libraries that I've been using?

898
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:05,059
Changing and distributing software

899
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:06,542
is similar to changing

900
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:10,130
and distributing music, so sometimes

901
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:17,467
you are not allowed to just reuse or

902
00:59:17,467 --> 00:59:19,570
take verbatim some piece of

903
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,912
code some other times you

904
00:59:20,912 --> 00:59:22,414
are actually fully allow and this

905
00:59:22,414 --> 00:59:23,716
is the why these software

906
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:26,861
licenses are basically enabling how

907
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:29,505
much you can reuse and

908
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:31,588
remix in your derivative work and

909
00:59:31,588 --> 00:59:35,354
how much you basically can touch

910
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:38,077
with this exercise maybe we take

911
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:40,940
it in a minute i want

912
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,682
to add a little parenthesis something

913
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:45,625
that i added recently to this page

914
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,467
which is something that came

915
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:49,569
up in previous code refinery workshops

916
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,351
because sometimes at least for

917
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:52,412
for researchers is more

918
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:55,795
familiar the concept of plagiarism

919
00:59:55,795 --> 00:59:57,076
which is not exactly the

920
00:59:57,076 --> 00:59:59,519
same as intellectual property rights

921
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:01,825
So plagiarism is more related

922
01:00:01,825 --> 01:00:06,015
to research ethics and so you can plagiarize,

923
01:00:06,877 --> 01:00:10,446
let's say that you copy paste the paper,

924
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:12,411
the scientific paper of someone

925
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:14,656
else's and just pass it as yours.

926
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,099
And of course, you know,

927
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:18,325
if your organization or whatever

928
01:00:18,325 --> 01:00:19,467
journal you submit that they

929
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:21,051
use something like Turnitin, they

930
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,053
would see that your paper

931
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:24,860
is plagiarized because it's, you know,

932
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,564
it's basically copy pasted

933
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:27,827
from someone else's work that

934
01:00:27,827 --> 01:00:28,789
you didn't acknowledge.

935
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:30,834
So plagiarism is this

936
01:00:30,834 --> 01:00:32,257
type of unacknowledged.

937
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,881
work, but intellectual property

938
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,865
rights infringement is more that

939
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:38,868
you are not authorized to

940
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,711
use someone else's work, that

941
01:00:40,711 --> 01:00:43,215
I'm not authorized to use, I don't know,

942
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:45,519
some seconds of [name]'s song to

943
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:47,763
make my own new song unless

944
01:00:47,763 --> 01:00:49,165
I ask for the permission.

945
01:00:49,165 --> 01:00:51,730
And this is basically the main idea

946
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,694
that stands behind this

947
01:00:53,694 --> 01:00:56,519
copyright licenses or patents, that

948
01:00:57,461 --> 01:00:59,465
it's not just about citing like

949
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:02,110
we would do with the plagiarism

950
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,094
from an ethics perspective.

951
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:06,158
It's more saying, okay,

952
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:08,443
I still cite you, of course,

953
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:10,227
I still say I use your code,

954
01:01:10,227 --> 01:01:11,450
but I also follow the rule

955
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:14,537
that come with your code, that

956
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,481
come with your patent or

957
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:19,007
whatever intellectual property rights

958
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:19,408
you have.

959
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,882
and so this is maybe something

960
01:01:21,882 --> 01:01:23,886
that sometimes it's not clear

961
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:25,449
these two aspects but they're

962
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:28,394
both important because plagiarism

963
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:30,258
from research ethics perspective

964
01:01:30,258 --> 01:01:33,444
can basically end in misconduct

965
01:01:33,444 --> 01:01:35,188
so your papers get actually

966
01:01:36,009 --> 01:01:39,115
retracted if you you know

967
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:40,679
plagiarize somebody without

968
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:42,963
giving acknowledgement

969
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:46,066
with the software maybe your

970
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:48,488
paper will not be retracted if

971
01:01:48,488 --> 01:01:53,333
you break the license of some other code

972
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,375
that you have included in your software

973
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,237
but of course the people

974
01:01:57,237 --> 01:01:58,838
who might have intellectual property

975
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:00,920
right they could potentially come

976
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,061
back to you and that is

977
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:04,403
like a criminal offense so

978
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:06,405
eventually you will need to pay

979
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:09,288
a fine or if not you your organization

980
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:10,510
I don't want to scare

981
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,272
anyone with this thing.

982
01:02:12,272 --> 01:02:13,774
Actually, I want to motivate people

983
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:15,235
that the good thing of

984
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,837
open source software and open

985
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:19,481
licenses is to avoid the

986
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:22,264
mess of proprietary intellectual

987
01:02:22,264 --> 01:02:24,987
property rights, copyrighted materials.

988
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,592
But I'm talking a lot and

989
01:02:28,592 --> 01:02:31,576
it's nice to always see our clever audience.

990
01:02:31,576 --> 01:02:34,439
So let me paste this question

991
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:37,523
to the notes document.

992
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:43,423
Now, maybe we don't need to

993
01:02:43,423 --> 01:02:45,426
go away from the stream, but

994
01:02:45,426 --> 01:02:50,252
we can ask everyone to vote by

995
01:02:50,252 --> 01:02:54,237
adding this O or zero, whatever

996
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:58,001
is your favorite in this example.

997
01:02:58,001 --> 01:03:00,945
So which of these are derivative works?

998
01:03:02,607 --> 01:03:04,269
I will switch to the notes

999
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:05,991
to see what people are answering.

1000
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:13,083
And these are interesting cases,

1001
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:14,465
I would say, let me check

1002
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:32,864
I think I've done them all So

1003
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:36,248
we can see that A is getting lots of traction

1004
01:03:37,797 --> 01:03:39,760
download some code from a website

1005
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,908
and add it onto it so yeah a and b

1006
01:03:43,908 --> 01:03:51,722
and do a lot yeah also what

1007
01:03:51,722 --> 01:03:53,325
we said at the beginning changing

1008
01:03:53,325 --> 01:03:55,128
code you got from somewhere

1009
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:56,651
because maybe like you mentioned

1010
01:03:56,651 --> 01:03:59,115
you help some researcher you

1011
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:00,818
give them a snippet yeah

1012
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:05,536
But then, I mean, for example,

1013
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:06,858
this is a clear case that

1014
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:09,422
you didn't give a license.

1015
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:11,325
You are not claiming any copyright.

1016
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:13,268
You will never, you know,

1017
01:04:13,268 --> 01:04:15,852
see you a researcher from your university.

1018
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:16,173
You did.

1019
01:04:17,595 --> 01:04:20,560
But then do you expect that, for example,

1020
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,064
your help or your services are,

1021
01:04:23,064 --> 01:04:24,947
for example, in the acknowledged

1022
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:26,610
section of the paper that

1023
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,392
they could acknowledge the

1024
01:04:28,392 --> 01:04:31,426
research software engineer or NTNU?

1025
01:04:31,426 --> 01:04:34,790
In some instances, the

1026
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,712
group are acknowledged, not

1027
01:04:36,712 --> 01:04:38,595
the individual, but the kind

1028
01:04:38,595 --> 01:04:41,438
of service that we provide.

1029
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,123
Yeah, but so then this is, it's still,

1030
01:04:45,123 --> 01:04:46,364
you know, it kind of

1031
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:48,046
goes with this legally, they

1032
01:04:48,046 --> 01:04:49,788
don't need to acknowledge you,

1033
01:04:49,788 --> 01:04:51,550
but ethically it's good that

1034
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:54,154
they acknowledge your group.

1035
01:04:54,154 --> 01:04:55,255
We have the same at

1036
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:56,456
Aalto University with the

1037
01:04:56,456 --> 01:04:57,778
research software engineers and

1038
01:04:57,778 --> 01:05:00,201
our HPC cluster.

1039
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:03,726
so when it comes to

1040
01:05:03,726 --> 01:05:07,557
e so completely rewriting code

1041
01:05:07,557 --> 01:05:12,170
you got from somewhere is it

1042
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,542
derivative work in your opinion [name]

1043
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,683
I'm not sure.

1044
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:20,870
I think it's rewriting, it can

1045
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,293
be done in several ways.

1046
01:05:23,293 --> 01:05:24,635
You have an HDR, which

1047
01:05:24,635 --> 01:05:30,463
is clean room design, which I

1048
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:33,787
think is an AMD that designs

1049
01:05:33,787 --> 01:05:36,991
the Intel processor or the x86

1050
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:38,493
processor from a clean room

1051
01:05:38,493 --> 01:05:39,975
designer to just get a

1052
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:44,125
described and i'm not sure

1053
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,228
there are some stories computer

1054
01:05:47,228 --> 01:05:49,331
stories around clean room this kind

1055
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:51,914
so it's through age it's

1056
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,996
a bit different than e because i could

1057
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:56,239
even take a library and all i

1058
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:58,041
do is copy it line by

1059
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,563
line just changing the name of

1060
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:02,346
the variables and the name

1061
01:06:02,346 --> 01:06:03,847
of the functions that's not

1062
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:06,010
true that's not real writing

1063
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:10,979
But it's like people,

1064
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,946
unfortunately, they write essays with ChatGPT,

1065
01:06:14,946 --> 01:06:17,591
so they copy whatever line of text

1066
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:18,994
and then they just add an

1067
01:06:18,994 --> 01:06:25,568
adjective and so making it their own.

1068
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:30,073
Well, but there again, I mean, you like,

1069
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,816
you have in JetBrains or VS

1070
01:06:32,816 --> 01:06:36,840
Code, you have GitHub client,

1071
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,683
which then expands code for you.

1072
01:06:39,683 --> 01:06:41,686
And what kind of code is that?

1073
01:06:42,687 --> 01:06:46,431
Is that code it has seen on the internet?

1074
01:06:47,272 --> 01:06:51,456
Or does it generate it purely for you?

1075
01:06:51,456 --> 01:06:53,599
I don't think it does the last one.

1076
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,167
I think it's get it somewhere.

1077
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:58,012
yeah it's a mesh it's a

1078
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:01,017
it's a puzzle of different pieces

1079
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:06,005
but yeah this was good and i would say

1080
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:08,189
that you kind of got the

1081
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,434
got the right answer in the i

1082
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:12,316
go back to the page in

1083
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:15,581
the page there's a solution that

1084
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:18,506
um but i still think that

1085
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:20,449
sometimes it's always you know

1086
01:07:21,779 --> 01:07:26,869
It's always nuanced and tricky.

1087
01:07:29,854 --> 01:07:32,118
We mentioned last Wednesday,

1088
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:34,443
we talked about containers and

1089
01:07:34,443 --> 01:07:36,487
containers are interesting because

1090
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:40,004
they are like

1091
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:41,606
that you can basically look

1092
01:07:41,606 --> 01:07:44,871
at containers as a recipe of

1093
01:07:44,871 --> 01:07:47,215
all the system that you need

1094
01:07:47,215 --> 01:07:49,578
to run your software so that

1095
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:52,042
if i distribute just a recipe this is

1096
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:54,466
how you build my kitchen i'm

1097
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:55,447
not giving you the whole

1098
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,831
kitchen just the recipe of how to build it

1099
01:07:57,831 --> 01:07:59,814
so that you can run whatever

1100
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:02,237
food that i'm asking you to

1101
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:05,843
make but one can also basically

1102
01:08:05,843 --> 01:08:08,827
create build the container image

1103
01:08:08,827 --> 01:08:13,179
and then distribute the binary kind of

1104
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:15,927
and this is again another nuanced thing

1105
01:08:15,927 --> 01:08:18,896
and tricky thing because in

1106
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:21,162
the end when you aggregate

1107
01:08:21,162 --> 01:08:23,035
all these things together

1108
01:08:23,035 --> 01:08:25,659
I added the reference there from the GPL

1109
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:27,923
if it's just aggregation that

1110
01:08:27,923 --> 01:08:29,725
you collect some libraries and

1111
01:08:29,725 --> 01:08:30,967
put them together but they're

1112
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:32,850
still you know that someone

1113
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,533
can basically look at the

1114
01:08:34,533 --> 01:08:36,896
container image look inside and see

1115
01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:38,279
that different libraries have

1116
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,382
their different licenses it's okay

1117
01:08:41,403 --> 01:08:42,565
but when the moment that you

1118
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:44,468
just wrap the container around

1119
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:46,171
a run script that in the

1120
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:48,955
end is just whatever name of the command

1121
01:08:48,955 --> 01:08:50,777
and then some input file that

1122
01:08:50,777 --> 01:08:52,899
you pass then you're creating

1123
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:56,483
like a new software like a binary

1124
01:08:56,483 --> 01:08:57,664
that would have inside all

1125
01:08:57,664 --> 01:08:59,245
the libraries and then it

1126
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:01,928
gets more tricky because of these licenses

1127
01:09:01,928 --> 01:09:03,349
that I will you can already

1128
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:06,893
see the picture below because

1129
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:11,097
then it's then you can't just

1130
01:09:11,097 --> 01:09:13,880
release it with whatever license that you want

1131
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,784
to release this container image

1132
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:16,625
but you might need to

1133
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:20,012
follow you know whatever more

1134
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:22,416
strict license that is so so

1135
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:25,222
if you have a have gpl copy

1136
01:09:25,222 --> 01:09:28,868
left inside in your software

1137
01:09:28,868 --> 01:09:31,634
stack that then goes for

1138
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,960
the whole container that you're creating

1139
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:38,424
exactly and this is why these licenses

1140
01:09:39,485 --> 01:09:41,207
that are still open source licenses

1141
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:43,610
but they're called viral because

1142
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:46,494
they kind of infect all the

1143
01:09:46,494 --> 01:09:49,297
rest of the code or software that you are

1144
01:09:49,297 --> 01:09:50,719
that you are sharing the

1145
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,482
idea made basically that let's say

1146
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:56,065
that you build the software

1147
01:09:56,065 --> 01:09:58,388
so that it within this

1148
01:09:58,388 --> 01:09:59,850
pipeline or whatever tool that

1149
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,193
you build is going to call libraries

1150
01:10:02,193 --> 01:10:04,397
that have different licenses that

1151
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:06,700
the very permissive open license

1152
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,423
that you might want to use

1153
01:10:08,423 --> 01:10:11,388
well then some licenses of other tools are

1154
01:10:11,388 --> 01:10:12,730
so strict that they would

1155
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:17,498
basically force their license on your license

1156
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:19,240
So to understand this with

1157
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,082
this picture which comes from a

1158
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:22,304
paper of the European

1159
01:10:22,304 --> 01:10:24,046
Commission specifically for the

1160
01:10:24,046 --> 01:10:25,888
European Union public license one

1161
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,691
type of open source license.

1162
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:30,454
So you can think of the

1163
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:32,397
code that exists in the world

1164
01:10:32,397 --> 01:10:35,921
to be divided between proprietary code

1165
01:10:35,921 --> 01:10:37,603
that basically follows proprietary

1166
01:10:37,603 --> 01:10:40,547
licenses full copyright and then

1167
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:42,389
you have open source code.

1168
01:10:42,389 --> 01:10:44,232
Now in the open source code,

1169
01:10:44,232 --> 01:10:46,837
so this green triangle that you see here,

1170
01:10:46,837 --> 01:10:48,700
that is like a continuum

1171
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,564
of different type of licenses

1172
01:10:50,564 --> 01:10:52,768
that you can attach to the open source code.

1173
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:54,832
So some here at the

1174
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:56,795
bottom, dark green, they are

1175
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,639
very permissive licenses.

1176
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:00,602
There's basically no condition.

1177
01:11:00,602 --> 01:11:03,247
Sometimes the only condition is that

1178
01:11:03,247 --> 01:11:04,648
Well, actually, let's start from

1179
01:11:04,648 --> 01:11:05,669
the very bottom.

1180
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:06,510
At the very bottom, we

1181
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:10,594
have this gray block, which is public domain.

1182
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:11,795
This basically means that

1183
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:14,877
there's absolutely no license or

1184
01:11:14,877 --> 01:11:15,978
some type of licenses are

1185
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:18,781
called the unlicensed or this.

1186
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:19,822
For data, they're called

1187
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:20,923
Creative Commons Zero.

1188
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:23,185
So this is public knowledge.

1189
01:11:23,185 --> 01:11:24,806
Nobody owns it.

1190
01:11:24,806 --> 01:11:27,208
And you can release code

1191
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,590
under this unlicensed.

1192
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:32,373
So this is the hello world in C.

1193
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:33,603
Right.

1194
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:34,047
Exactly.

1195
01:11:35,115 --> 01:11:35,950
Public domain.

1196
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,932
nobody you don't need to you

1197
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:39,173
know make sure that you

1198
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:41,436
don't offend any developer of C

1199
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,479
hello world in C is public domain

1200
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,381
but then you start of

1201
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:49,324
course having this open source licensee

1202
01:11:49,324 --> 01:11:51,686
and the very permissive one all

1203
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:53,808
they ask is that you keep the license

1204
01:11:53,808 --> 01:11:55,871
if you reuse the code and just

1205
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:56,852
what we said earlier

1206
01:11:56,852 --> 01:11:58,553
acknowledge that you've been

1207
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:01,076
reusing somebody else's code

1208
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,018
that you're building on top of it

1209
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,100
The good thing of this

1210
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,502
permissive license is that if

1211
01:12:05,502 --> 01:12:07,184
you have a company, if you

1212
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:08,246
work in a company and you

1213
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,670
need to include some libraries or

1214
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:12,172
some pieces of code that are

1215
01:12:12,172 --> 01:12:13,354
released with this permissive

1216
01:12:13,354 --> 01:12:15,277
license, then it's possible.

1217
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:16,900
So this red arrow means that

1218
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,657
yes, you can actually include them.

1219
01:12:19,657 --> 01:12:22,584
So, for example, I mentioned Armadillo

1220
01:12:22,584 --> 01:12:24,990
as a linear algebra library,

1221
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,636
which has Apache 2.0.

1222
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:30,664
So then you can include that

1223
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:31,987
and use that in your

1224
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:34,726
proprietary product that you sell.

1225
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,469
exactly and i'm pretty sure

1226
01:12:36,469 --> 01:12:38,713
that many codes that researchers

1227
01:12:38,713 --> 01:12:41,539
have written are actually now they

1228
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:43,603
do exist in actual products that

1229
01:12:43,603 --> 01:12:46,568
can be in our smartphones or

1230
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:48,572
you know whatever because they've

1231
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:50,275
been released with permissive

1232
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:52,058
open source licenses and then

1233
01:12:52,058 --> 01:12:53,882
they can be reused basically

1234
01:12:53,882 --> 01:12:56,647
for commercial proprietary use

1235
01:12:56,647 --> 01:12:59,190
But the more we keep on

1236
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,053
going up in this type of

1237
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:04,357
continuum of strictness of the

1238
01:13:04,357 --> 01:13:06,660
open source licenses, the more

1239
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,683
we introduce the concept of copyleft.

1240
01:13:10,205 --> 01:13:13,389
And the idea of copyleft, I don't know

1241
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,953
how to explain it in an intuitive way,

1242
01:13:15,953 --> 01:13:17,695
but it would be... I think

1243
01:13:17,695 --> 01:13:20,178
the concept is, if you go

1244
01:13:20,178 --> 01:13:23,022
to copyright, Richard Stallman...

1245
01:13:23,022 --> 01:13:26,708
coined this phrase copy left and

1246
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:27,970
he took it from copyright

1247
01:13:28,811 --> 01:13:31,816
and copyright is strong it's

1248
01:13:31,816 --> 01:13:34,320
somebody's work right and but

1249
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,225
copy left then is also strong

1250
01:13:37,225 --> 01:13:39,889
but it goes the opposite way

1251
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:42,413
it kind of influences everything

1252
01:13:42,413 --> 01:13:43,815
it's included in

1253
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:45,546
Exactly.

1254
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,327
And I guess this is

1255
01:13:46,327 --> 01:13:50,352
the kind of motivational factor of Stalma

1256
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:52,675
and others who started, who

1257
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:55,939
promoted these various copyleft licenses

1258
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:57,140
so that you find my

1259
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:58,522
product useful, you find my

1260
01:13:58,522 --> 01:13:59,804
code useful, and you want to

1261
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:00,885
include it in your

1262
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:04,970
proprietary package, software, whatever.

1263
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,031
Well, actually, you also need

1264
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:07,013
to make your proprietary

1265
01:14:07,013 --> 01:14:10,817
software basically following the same license.

1266
01:14:10,817 --> 01:14:12,128
Yes.

1267
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:14,311
But there is an interesting

1268
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:16,174
link on the weak copyleft

1269
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,920
into proprietary licenses.

1270
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:24,186
Because the difference between

1271
01:14:24,186 --> 01:14:27,631
weak and strong is worth mentioning.

1272
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:30,016
And LGPL

1273
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:34,863
and also the Mozilla license, which is MPL.

1274
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:38,168
There you can have a

1275
01:14:38,168 --> 01:14:41,493
library that's licensed under LGPL.

1276
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,199
So everything you do to

1277
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:49,525
the library itself has to be public

1278
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:52,129
or open source, but you can

1279
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:53,591
use the library in your

1280
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:57,677
proprietary software or closed source project.

1281
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:02,536
And for Mozilla, that goes

1282
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,639
for individual files, so you can

1283
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,226
use the MPL to then go

1284
01:15:09,226 --> 01:15:11,870
public with individual files, but

1285
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:13,553
it can be used in

1286
01:15:13,553 --> 01:15:16,257
closed source projects without

1287
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:20,263
having any consequences for the

1288
01:15:20,263 --> 01:15:21,285
closed source project.

1289
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:27,203
yeah this is a great explanation

1290
01:15:27,203 --> 01:15:28,886
because then it really

1291
01:15:28,886 --> 01:15:31,672
makes people understand the importance

1292
01:15:31,672 --> 01:15:35,138
of this continuum and I've

1293
01:15:35,138 --> 01:15:36,661
been reflecting with others in

1294
01:15:36,661 --> 01:15:38,605
Code Refinery we have a nice

1295
01:15:38,605 --> 01:15:41,330
Zulip chat where we have sometimes this type of

1296
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,619
conversation on one hand I feel

1297
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:45,822
that sometimes we should

1298
01:15:45,822 --> 01:15:47,707
release our software with a

1299
01:15:47,707 --> 01:15:49,632
strong copy left so that if

1300
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:52,300
whoever big tech giant will

1301
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,004
actually reuse our software they

1302
01:15:54,004 --> 01:15:56,872
need to also join the strong copy left

1303
01:15:56,872 --> 01:15:59,416
But the problem is that most

1304
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,160
likely the big tech giant is

1305
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,223
just going to rewrite my code and not cite me.

1306
01:16:07,508 --> 01:16:10,312
So in the end, the strong copy left,

1307
01:16:10,312 --> 01:16:12,695
although in principle I totally agree,

1308
01:16:12,695 --> 01:16:14,017
is going to create troubles

1309
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:15,520
to actually to my peers,

1310
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,022
to other scientists who just want

1311
01:16:17,022 --> 01:16:18,985
to reuse my function or my

1312
01:16:18,985 --> 01:16:21,307
library or my method.

1313
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:23,230
So most of the time you

1314
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,674
will see research code released

1315
01:16:25,674 --> 01:16:27,797
under this MIT or Apache or

1316
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:29,920
BSD because then you know that

1317
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,202
you make the life of other

1318
01:16:31,202 --> 01:16:32,865
people like you easier, that

1319
01:16:32,865 --> 01:16:35,028
they can just reuse it, don't

1320
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:37,412
worry too much about licenses

1321
01:16:37,412 --> 01:16:40,477
and get their papers out basically.

1322
01:16:40,477 --> 01:16:42,541
So I don't know.

1323
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,563
Do you ever?

1324
01:16:43,563 --> 01:16:46,368
Where do you sit in this spectrum?

1325
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:52,520
My heart is on the GPL,

1326
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,407
but my praxis is MIT.

1327
01:16:56,407 --> 01:17:00,571
so basically we agree and

1328
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:02,312
then in this picture here there

1329
01:17:02,312 --> 01:17:04,834
are also some licenses that

1330
01:17:04,834 --> 01:17:06,256
are not really related to

1331
01:17:06,256 --> 01:17:07,937
code they're more related to data

1332
01:17:08,998 --> 01:17:11,620
we will touch on this data aspects

1333
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,981
so even though this is

1334
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:14,603
code refinery there will be a

1335
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:16,284
data refinery at the end of

1336
01:17:16,284 --> 01:17:19,447
today but we basically have

1337
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:22,169
two minutes before the break and

1338
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:26,393
we kind of already covered all of this

1339
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:30,098
maybe we could have a

1340
01:17:30,098 --> 01:17:33,422
break 10 minutes break starting now

1341
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:36,326
and then there's interesting

1342
01:17:36,326 --> 01:17:39,450
questions on what about stack

1343
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:43,495
overflow not there but in the

1344
01:17:43,495 --> 01:17:46,299
if you go licensing situations

1345
01:17:46,299 --> 01:17:49,783
I pasted the stack overflow

1346
01:17:49,783 --> 01:17:51,806
questionnaire into Claude from

1347
01:17:51,806 --> 01:17:55,199
Antrofic isn't it

1348
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:59,583
And Claude answered that the

1349
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:02,666
Stack Overflow or the code

1350
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,608
from Stack Overflow wouldn't be

1351
01:18:04,608 --> 01:18:06,710
licensed under creative commons.

1352
01:18:08,732 --> 01:18:15,718
But the practice for small

1353
01:18:15,718 --> 01:18:18,160
code snippets was that you just could copy

1354
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,803
and paste it and not refer

1355
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:23,265
to where you didn't get it from.

1356
01:18:26,131 --> 01:18:26,432
Yeah.

1357
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,079
But in the end, I think

1358
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,823
that the terms of service of

1359
01:18:31,823 --> 01:18:36,272
Stack Overflow is that it follows this.

1360
01:18:36,272 --> 01:18:37,495
Yeah, that you have to

1361
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:41,423
attribute where you didn't get it from, yeah.

1362
01:18:42,382 --> 01:18:46,169
of course who does it and

1363
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:47,331
i sometimes i add it in

1364
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:51,318
the comments this was taken from yeah

1365
01:18:51,318 --> 01:18:52,941
but i've seen comments where

1366
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:58,551
the link to the stack overflow dialogue is so

1367
01:19:00,252 --> 01:19:01,315
All right, but it's 2 p.m.

1368
01:19:01,315 --> 01:19:02,758
o'clock in Finland, so it's

1369
01:19:02,758 --> 01:19:04,202
perfect time for a break.

1370
01:19:05,305 --> 01:19:09,535
Let's say 10 minutes break and

1371
01:19:09,535 --> 01:19:11,140
get back at 10 past.

1372
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,385
I will edit the notes document

1373
01:19:13,385 --> 01:19:16,673
and we can switch to the notes here now.

1374
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:16,894
Bye.

1375
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:40,525
hello hopefully you had a short break

1376
01:28:40,525 --> 01:28:42,627
and stretch your legs it was

1377
01:28:42,627 --> 01:28:45,210
a nice comment important comment

1378
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:47,493
in the notes document on kind

1379
01:28:47,493 --> 01:28:49,495
of what are these arrows so we

1380
01:28:49,495 --> 01:28:51,197
try to explain a bit but i

1381
01:28:51,197 --> 01:28:52,859
agree also with the commenter that

1382
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,122
maybe this is not the most

1383
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:59,787
clear picture for expressing you know

1384
01:28:59,787 --> 01:29:03,211
how licenses interplays but I

1385
01:29:03,211 --> 01:29:07,417
think the take-home message is you know

1386
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:08,758
if for your work for

1387
01:29:08,758 --> 01:29:10,180
your daily research work try

1388
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:14,886
to use a permissive license and maybe

1389
01:29:14,886 --> 01:29:15,887
when you start working in

1390
01:29:15,887 --> 01:29:17,770
a larger project that could

1391
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,572
enforce stronger licenses you

1392
01:29:19,572 --> 01:29:21,975
know remember that then those

1393
01:29:21,975 --> 01:29:23,837
who want to write proprietary

1394
01:29:23,837 --> 01:29:25,499
software with your work they will

1395
01:29:25,499 --> 01:29:28,343
not be able unless they fully reopen everything

1396
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:32,283
so maybe we will not

1397
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:35,046
do this licensee exercise there

1398
01:29:35,046 --> 01:29:36,328
are interesting questions and

1399
01:29:36,328 --> 01:29:38,070
that's the solutions there for

1400
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:40,392
you just to wrap up this

1401
01:29:40,392 --> 01:29:44,457
license episode it's in general

1402
01:29:44,457 --> 01:29:46,359
when should i add a license

1403
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:48,923
where i would say choose a license

1404
01:29:48,923 --> 01:29:51,365
as early as possible in the project

1405
01:29:51,365 --> 01:29:53,328
if you remember what we did

1406
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:54,589
on the first week where we

1407
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:57,513
created a github repository using

1408
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:59,575
the github interface

1409
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:02,259
When you create the repository

1410
01:30:02,259 --> 01:30:04,101
through the web interface,

1411
01:30:04,101 --> 01:30:05,323
it would actually immediately ask

1412
01:30:05,323 --> 01:30:07,025
you, do you want to add a license?

1413
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:08,487
So already that's a good

1414
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:11,572
moment that you can already pick a license.

1415
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:14,236
Sometimes you don't have all

1416
01:30:14,236 --> 01:30:15,998
the possible list of all

1417
01:30:15,998 --> 01:30:18,201
the possible licenses that exist

1418
01:30:18,201 --> 01:30:21,185
in this world, which brings us

1419
01:30:21,185 --> 01:30:22,407
to the next topic.

1420
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:25,851
that how to choose a license

1421
01:30:25,851 --> 01:30:29,877
and it's there are so many

1422
01:30:29,877 --> 01:30:32,620
licenses out there and I'm

1423
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:35,344
sure every license has a reason to exist

1424
01:30:35,344 --> 01:30:36,826
but you can see already

1425
01:30:36,826 --> 01:30:39,249
in the software that you use

1426
01:30:39,249 --> 01:30:41,311
if you find the source code

1427
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:44,976
of whatever library that there's

1428
01:30:44,976 --> 01:30:46,538
a subset of licenses that are

1429
01:30:46,538 --> 01:30:49,542
more used than others

1430
01:30:49,542 --> 01:30:51,444
But maybe what is important

1431
01:30:51,444 --> 01:30:54,728
for you to remember is that

1432
01:30:54,728 --> 01:30:57,791
do not rewrite your own license.

1433
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:00,053
Do not invent the wheel.

1434
01:31:00,053 --> 01:31:02,536
These specific licenses, the wordings

1435
01:31:02,536 --> 01:31:04,278
that they include, they are

1436
01:31:04,278 --> 01:31:06,701
built exactly for those purposes.

1437
01:31:06,701 --> 01:31:10,565
So it's much easier and better

1438
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:12,827
that you find the right license

1439
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:14,970
for your case and then

1440
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,032
just reuse that license

1441
01:31:17,032 --> 01:31:18,854
without any modification.

1442
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:23,060
And the reason for not rewriting

1443
01:31:24,241 --> 01:31:26,084
or writing your own license is

1444
01:31:26,084 --> 01:31:28,787
that your license will not

1445
01:31:28,787 --> 01:31:30,890
be recognized and then people have

1446
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:32,592
to use a lot of effort

1447
01:31:32,592 --> 01:31:34,335
trying to understand what the

1448
01:31:34,335 --> 01:31:37,819
implications of your license are.

1449
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:38,280
Exactly.

1450
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:42,775
There are different tools out there.

1451
01:31:42,775 --> 01:31:44,357
I think in the links in

1452
01:31:44,357 --> 01:31:48,125
the bottom we list more other

1453
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:50,249
of this, how to choose a license.

1454
01:31:50,249 --> 01:31:53,074
This one here, which is

1455
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:55,298
part of the Interopable Europe,

1456
01:31:55,298 --> 01:31:57,382
it's like a European Commission

1457
01:31:57,382 --> 01:31:59,286
website all related to licenses

1458
01:31:59,286 --> 01:32:01,109
and software and things like that.

1459
01:32:01,109 --> 01:32:03,014
And here, for example, you

1460
01:32:03,014 --> 01:32:06,542
can look at various types of licenses

1461
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:08,667
that are available by specifying,

1462
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:10,070
you know, what the license can

1463
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:12,436
do or must do or cannot do.

1464
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:15,082
And you can also show here,

1465
01:32:15,082 --> 01:32:17,107
for example, if I write MIT.

1466
01:32:17,107 --> 01:32:19,412
that we mentioned earlier so

1467
01:32:19,412 --> 01:32:22,738
we can see that you know

1468
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:24,943
others can use reproduce

1469
01:32:24,943 --> 01:32:27,448
distribute modify whatever you

1470
01:32:27,448 --> 01:32:30,374
work they release what they must

1471
01:32:30,374 --> 01:32:34,943
do is that they must include basically your

1472
01:32:34,943 --> 01:32:37,289
name and surname and copyright

1473
01:32:37,289 --> 01:32:38,252
that is there in your

1474
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,598
version of the license and you

1475
01:32:40,598 --> 01:32:43,024
cannot be hold liable if they

1476
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:46,313
misuse your your software this

1477
01:32:46,313 --> 01:32:48,097
license is compatible with

1478
01:32:48,097 --> 01:32:50,303
anything basically it's a very permissive

1479
01:32:51,751 --> 01:32:53,754
and so you know it

1480
01:32:53,754 --> 01:32:57,000
is strong community-based license it's

1481
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,925
a it's so it's a it's a good good license

1482
01:33:00,967 --> 01:33:02,008
so this this type of

1483
01:33:02,008 --> 01:33:04,533
tools again personally what i

1484
01:33:04,533 --> 01:33:06,576
recommend is to check what

1485
01:33:06,576 --> 01:33:08,820
other people what the people

1486
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,403
that are making the software

1487
01:33:10,403 --> 01:33:12,406
the language that you use what they use

1488
01:33:12,406 --> 01:33:14,910
and kind of join their community

1489
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:16,252
and use a similar license.

1490
01:33:18,074 --> 01:33:20,879
It's a kind of a no brainer.

1491
01:33:20,879 --> 01:33:21,680
But then maybe if you

1492
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:25,706
go work outside academia in a company

1493
01:33:26,687 --> 01:33:28,530
where maybe code is actually

1494
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:29,912
a product of the company,

1495
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:34,899
then maybe depending on where you will work,

1496
01:33:34,899 --> 01:33:38,044
maybe they will specifically use

1497
01:33:38,044 --> 01:33:39,666
some other type of licenses

1498
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:41,549
that might be more.

1499
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:49,213
more strict so let me go back

1500
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,043
Then here in the practical steps

1501
01:33:55,043 --> 01:33:56,285
for incorporating a license,

1502
01:33:56,285 --> 01:33:58,107
I already mentioned that what

1503
01:33:58,107 --> 01:34:00,670
the GitHub interface does, but

1504
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:04,014
in practice one way of doing it

1505
01:34:04,014 --> 01:34:06,958
is to create a license folder

1506
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:09,260
in your project and basically

1507
01:34:11,503 --> 01:34:13,866
put the unmodified licenses that

1508
01:34:13,866 --> 01:34:17,290
you use inside that project.

1509
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:20,894
again here if you are not sure

1510
01:34:20,894 --> 01:34:23,577
how to do it the best way is to copy

1511
01:34:23,577 --> 01:34:26,640
what other libraries are doing

1512
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,762
but basically the idea is that

1513
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:31,185
if you reuse in your code

1514
01:34:31,185 --> 01:34:33,467
if you embed somebody else's code

1515
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:35,469
that was released under their

1516
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:37,391
MIT license with their name

1517
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:38,973
and surname inside the MIT license

1518
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,335
so you can just copy all

1519
01:34:41,335 --> 01:34:42,697
the licenses from all the

1520
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:45,019
codes into this licenses folder

1521
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:47,212
And again, it's a bit

1522
01:34:47,212 --> 01:34:51,338
like this citation that it's a small effort

1523
01:34:51,338 --> 01:34:53,120
for you to include these licenses,

1524
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,924
but then it keeps track of

1525
01:34:55,924 --> 01:34:56,926
the kind of, you know,

1526
01:34:56,926 --> 01:34:59,589
acknowledging other people's work.

1527
01:34:59,589 --> 01:35:00,631
And, you know, maybe right

1528
01:35:00,631 --> 01:35:03,635
now in universities and academia,

1529
01:35:04,737 --> 01:35:08,422
it's not a metric that is already.

1530
01:35:08,422 --> 01:35:11,767
used in careers and CV, but

1531
01:35:11,767 --> 01:35:15,694
maybe I feel that it's coming in a sense

1532
01:35:15,694 --> 01:35:17,076
that if you share your data,

1533
01:35:17,076 --> 01:35:19,019
if you share your code and

1534
01:35:19,019 --> 01:35:20,341
you do it properly and

1535
01:35:20,341 --> 01:35:23,306
acknowledge others, this is also going

1536
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:26,511
to be an important metric for your academic CV.

1537
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:32,320
Something else to mention from this page.

1538
01:35:34,308 --> 01:35:40,217
So if your work is not derivative work,

1539
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:44,023
Well basically we were kind

1540
01:35:44,023 --> 01:35:47,448
of already mentioned this that

1541
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:50,834
if you don't reuse code of others

1542
01:35:51,715 --> 01:35:53,037
and what I mean that you

1543
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:55,401
don't include it in your repository

1544
01:35:55,401 --> 01:35:57,063
so you can of course still

1545
01:35:57,063 --> 01:36:00,629
import with the whatever Python

1546
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:03,954
or use whatever R library but

1547
01:36:03,954 --> 01:36:05,898
if your work is not derivative

1548
01:36:05,898 --> 01:36:06,739
in the sense that you are

1549
01:36:06,739 --> 01:36:08,682
not editing other people code

1550
01:36:08,682 --> 01:36:11,004
then what is important is that

1551
01:36:11,004 --> 01:36:14,287
you do not invent your own license.

1552
01:36:14,287 --> 01:36:15,809
So pick a standard license

1553
01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:17,010
and the tool that I was just

1554
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,591
showing is one of them.

1555
01:36:19,932 --> 01:36:21,974
And then again, you would like

1556
01:36:21,974 --> 01:36:23,836
to make sure that this is

1557
01:36:23,836 --> 01:36:26,398
visible in your repository, again

1558
01:36:26,398 --> 01:36:28,080
with the license folders that

1559
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,922
we mentioned earlier, so that

1560
01:36:30,922 --> 01:36:33,425
those who will find your code

1561
01:36:33,425 --> 01:36:37,538
and want to reuse it, they know how to cite you.

1562
01:36:37,538 --> 01:36:41,106
if you create the github repository

1563
01:36:41,106 --> 01:36:43,131
and click on the license

1564
01:36:44,053 --> 01:36:46,378
or select the license then the

1565
01:36:46,378 --> 01:36:48,844
the license file will be at

1566
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:52,472
the root of the repository yeah

1567
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:54,958
yeah yeah that's how that's the

1568
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:56,762
that's what i do basically normally

1569
01:36:59,898 --> 01:37:02,064
Before we switch to the

1570
01:37:02,064 --> 01:37:05,534
next topic, maybe just small

1571
01:37:06,617 --> 01:37:09,866
brackets on something that I

1572
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:12,614
might ask everyone who is

1573
01:37:12,614 --> 01:37:14,900
listening to the stream as anyone here.

1574
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:19,288
not used chatgpt or cloud or grok

1575
01:37:19,288 --> 01:37:20,931
or whatever github copilot to

1576
01:37:20,931 --> 01:37:23,736
generate code so if there's

1577
01:37:23,736 --> 01:37:25,318
usually always one person who has

1578
01:37:25,318 --> 01:37:28,584
not used this tool for for generating code

1579
01:37:28,584 --> 01:37:30,327
or generating text so that

1580
01:37:30,327 --> 01:37:32,952
person please write something in

1581
01:37:32,952 --> 01:37:34,154
the notes document

1582
01:37:34,154 --> 01:37:36,458
But most likely you have

1583
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,020
played or maybe you're using

1584
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:40,104
these tools for work.

1585
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,127
And these AI systems, they

1586
01:37:42,127 --> 01:37:45,552
are able to take, they basically

1587
01:37:45,552 --> 01:37:47,796
are text to code systems.

1588
01:37:47,796 --> 01:37:49,278
So they take a description of

1589
01:37:49,278 --> 01:37:52,784
the task as text and they generate code.

1590
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:56,890
and of course they are very useful

1591
01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:00,236
but when it comes to licenses the code

1592
01:38:00,236 --> 01:38:02,659
that is generated doesn't belong

1593
01:38:02,659 --> 01:38:05,043
to anyone or in in a way

1594
01:38:05,043 --> 01:38:07,066
just belongs to you means

1595
01:38:07,066 --> 01:38:09,751
that the responsibility fully fully

1596
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,134
lays on you who have generated the code

1597
01:38:12,134 --> 01:38:13,516
and decide what to do with

1598
01:38:13,516 --> 01:38:15,259
the code will you decide to

1599
01:38:15,259 --> 01:38:16,601
publish the code that was

1600
01:38:16,601 --> 01:38:18,184
generated well then you take

1601
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:19,666
the full responsibility

1602
01:38:19,666 --> 01:38:21,389
that you're not publishing

1603
01:38:21,389 --> 01:38:24,393
actually some verbatim copy paste

1604
01:38:24,393 --> 01:38:27,217
from a library that is proprietary

1605
01:38:27,217 --> 01:38:28,639
or a library that requires

1606
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:32,245
one of these very strong copyleft licenses

1607
01:38:33,807 --> 01:38:36,812
and unfortunately how these AI

1608
01:38:36,812 --> 01:38:38,394
systems out there make they're

1609
01:38:38,394 --> 01:38:40,217
not giving you they're not telling

1610
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:41,879
you okay I generated this code

1611
01:38:41,879 --> 01:38:45,164
for you it's actually 95% similar

1612
01:38:45,164 --> 01:38:47,807
to this existing code from

1613
01:38:47,807 --> 01:38:49,389
whatever from this library so

1614
01:38:49,389 --> 01:38:53,355
please cite the library as I wrote here

1615
01:38:53,355 --> 01:38:55,117
as a metaphor you can

1616
01:38:55,117 --> 01:38:58,962
never blame the autopilot or the company

1617
01:38:58,962 --> 01:39:00,364
who invented the autopilot but

1618
01:39:00,364 --> 01:39:02,466
only the driver is the one

1619
01:39:02,466 --> 01:39:04,329
to blame so please be

1620
01:39:04,329 --> 01:39:06,832
careful with the autopilots

1621
01:39:06,832 --> 01:39:08,915
Beyond this type of risks

1622
01:39:08,915 --> 01:39:12,019
of licenses, generated code has

1623
01:39:12,019 --> 01:39:15,844
been shown to have other types of risks.

1624
01:39:15,844 --> 01:39:18,628
Well, the most basic one is the risk

1625
01:39:18,628 --> 01:39:21,532
for your results that you

1626
01:39:21,532 --> 01:39:22,814
have from the generated work.

1627
01:39:22,814 --> 01:39:23,615
So you might think that

1628
01:39:23,615 --> 01:39:25,057
your code is actually doing.

1629
01:39:25,057 --> 01:39:26,260
What do you ask?

1630
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,126
But without code review, you

1631
01:39:29,126 --> 01:39:30,669
might be that your results are false.

1632
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:33,575
There are the risk for the systems in use.

1633
01:39:33,575 --> 01:39:36,000
Sometimes the generated code

1634
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,804
actually has malicious code.

1635
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,951
And I give you one example.

1636
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:43,857
So [name], what does it say?

1637
01:39:43,857 --> 01:39:45,813
Are you able to read what is written there?

1638
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,955
Yeah, I'm reading Microsoft

1639
01:39:47,955 --> 01:39:50,018
in both instances.

1640
01:39:50,018 --> 01:39:51,560
Yeah, so this is, it

1641
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,161
looks like Microsoft, but it's

1642
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:55,864
actually RN Microsoft.

1643
01:39:57,046 --> 01:40:00,309
So again, you know, of course, maybe

1644
01:40:00,309 --> 01:40:01,871
if one would zoom in, you

1645
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:05,195
would see that this is not Microsoft, it's RN.

1646
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:07,618
And often these editors that we use

1647
01:40:07,618 --> 01:40:09,039
for writing code, they have

1648
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,184
this monospace fonts so that you, you know,

1649
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,946
In theory, you would be able to see

1650
01:40:14,946 --> 01:40:16,027
that you're not importing

1651
01:40:16,027 --> 01:40:17,489
something from Microsoft, but

1652
01:40:17,489 --> 01:40:20,011
from whatever type of squatted.

1653
01:40:21,293 --> 01:40:22,854
But these things are happening

1654
01:40:22,854 --> 01:40:26,198
and it's a risk.

1655
01:40:26,198 --> 01:40:27,559
But if we stick to the

1656
01:40:27,559 --> 01:40:29,461
topic of these lessons, so

1657
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:32,725
to licenses, a recent paper estimates

1658
01:40:32,725 --> 01:40:34,106
that around 2% of AI

1659
01:40:34,106 --> 01:40:36,228
generated code is strikingly

1660
01:40:36,228 --> 01:40:39,712
similar to existing open source implementation.

1661
01:40:39,712 --> 01:40:41,855
so two percent is very little

1662
01:40:41,855 --> 01:40:45,319
it might well be that none

1663
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:46,601
in this room nobody in this

1664
01:40:46,601 --> 01:40:47,723
room and nobody who's watching

1665
01:40:47,723 --> 01:40:49,805
the stream has ever actually

1666
01:40:49,805 --> 01:40:52,229
experienced to generate something

1667
01:40:52,229 --> 01:40:54,612
that is strikingly similar

1668
01:40:54,612 --> 01:40:56,875
to something existing but then

1669
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:58,156
again something that maybe you

1670
01:40:58,156 --> 01:41:00,580
should consider the way i

1671
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:02,462
use this technology sometimes to

1672
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:06,692
you know, maybe convert a

1673
01:41:06,692 --> 01:41:08,233
couple of lines into a

1674
01:41:08,233 --> 01:41:13,319
function or refactor some small bits of code,

1675
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:15,001
but I don't, I personally find

1676
01:41:15,001 --> 01:41:17,304
it too risky to, you know,

1677
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:19,407
generate 500 lines of code.

1678
01:41:19,407 --> 01:41:20,328
I don't have time to read

1679
01:41:20,328 --> 01:41:22,931
500 lines of code and I'm not

1680
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:24,272
just going to copy paste them.

1681
01:41:24,272 --> 01:41:26,275
And even though when I run

1682
01:41:26,275 --> 01:41:27,937
them, I see that they, that

1683
01:41:27,937 --> 01:41:28,818
they do what I expect.

1684
01:41:29,799 --> 01:41:30,680
I don't know if you'll be

1685
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,323
on, what is your, whatever,

1686
01:41:33,323 --> 01:41:36,787
moral policy in using this type of tools.

1687
01:41:36,787 --> 01:41:39,229
Do you find them useful?

1688
01:41:39,229 --> 01:41:42,152
Yeah, I find them very useful.

1689
01:41:42,152 --> 01:41:45,115
And also being surprised how

1690
01:41:45,115 --> 01:41:48,960
good they are to write algorithms.

1691
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,582
You ask for something and then

1692
01:41:51,582 --> 01:41:53,845
you get a full algorithm.

1693
01:41:53,845 --> 01:41:56,507
Well, I haven't seen algorithms

1694
01:41:56,507 --> 01:41:59,871
500 lines long, but 50 lines long.

1695
01:42:00,712 --> 01:42:03,137
And when you run it, it

1696
01:42:03,137 --> 01:42:06,484
does things as you are supposed to.

1697
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:11,334
But I only used it for experimenting.

1698
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:13,919
I haven't published any code

1699
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:18,689
generated from GitHub Copilot.

1700
01:42:18,689 --> 01:42:18,890
Yeah.

1701
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:19,274
Yeah.

1702
01:42:19,274 --> 01:42:21,138
I totally agree, especially as

1703
01:42:22,982 --> 01:42:24,124
part of my work, we work

1704
01:42:24,124 --> 01:42:26,569
with users who maybe they have

1705
01:42:26,569 --> 01:42:28,012
not been trained as coders.

1706
01:42:28,012 --> 01:42:29,395
And it's amazing that now

1707
01:42:29,395 --> 01:42:32,922
finally everyone can code and

1708
01:42:32,922 --> 01:42:34,765
they can understand, they can read the code.

1709
01:42:34,765 --> 01:42:36,108
It's also a learning tool because

1710
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,972
you see a good example of a code.

1711
01:42:37,972 --> 01:42:41,598
But at least I'm happy

1712
01:42:41,598 --> 01:42:44,062
to always remind them of the risks

1713
01:42:44,062 --> 01:42:45,244
that if they don't understand

1714
01:42:45,244 --> 01:42:48,530
what a specific line is doing, maybe,

1715
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:49,632
you know, talk with your

1716
01:42:49,632 --> 01:42:52,396
local software engineer or try

1717
01:42:52,396 --> 01:42:54,219
to uncomment that line, everything

1718
01:42:54,219 --> 01:42:57,226
fails or what happens.

1719
01:42:57,226 --> 01:42:58,848
So I don't know where we will go.

1720
01:42:58,848 --> 01:43:01,371
Maybe one possible future that

1721
01:43:01,371 --> 01:43:04,094
I wrote here is that if

1722
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,836
future version of these tools

1723
01:43:05,836 --> 01:43:08,219
that generate code, let's say

1724
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:11,042
that they would be trained only on MIT code,

1725
01:43:11,903 --> 01:43:13,164
then most likely what they

1726
01:43:13,164 --> 01:43:15,907
synthesize is MIT code and then

1727
01:43:15,907 --> 01:43:17,449
we don't have issue.

1728
01:43:17,449 --> 01:43:18,450
But right now the issue

1729
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:21,654
with these AI systems is that nobody knows

1730
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,256
what went there, which most

1731
01:43:23,256 --> 01:43:26,099
likely means that everything went there.

1732
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:29,430
yeah yes absolutely so you know

1733
01:43:32,299 --> 01:43:34,807
but yes so maybe a quick

1734
01:43:34,807 --> 01:43:35,910
look at the notes if

1735
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:38,117
there's any interesting comment

1736
01:43:44,965 --> 01:43:47,068
okay well nothing maybe too

1737
01:43:47,068 --> 01:43:48,669
relevant we can we can

1738
01:43:48,669 --> 01:43:50,512
maybe continue already with the

1739
01:43:51,853 --> 01:43:53,555
next page oh yeah the bottom

1740
01:43:53,555 --> 01:43:54,436
of the page there's many

1741
01:43:54,436 --> 01:43:57,160
many many good resources on how

1742
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:01,084
to choose a license and and so on

1743
01:44:01,084 --> 01:44:04,268
so you can happily browse all

1744
01:44:04,268 --> 01:44:06,871
of them and i switch to the

1745
01:44:06,871 --> 01:44:08,193
next page which is now

1746
01:44:08,193 --> 01:44:11,257
software citations so beyond

1747
01:44:11,257 --> 01:44:13,760
yeah well that was one

1748
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,043
question in the comments why do

1749
01:44:16,043 --> 01:44:18,105
we use licensee folder with

1750
01:44:18,105 --> 01:44:23,111
many licenses uh with them

1751
01:44:23,111 --> 01:44:27,216
licenses clash pass each other

1752
01:44:27,216 --> 01:44:29,699
one will allow something while

1753
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:33,763
other will commit it uh after

1754
01:44:33,763 --> 01:44:35,906
now i would strictly i was

1755
01:44:35,906 --> 01:44:37,207
need thought with it stick

1756
01:44:37,207 --> 01:44:39,390
to explicitly one license

1757
01:44:41,328 --> 01:44:43,892
Yes I'm not sure what you

1758
01:44:43,892 --> 01:44:46,155
refer to several licenses but it could be

1759
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:48,178
that if you have imported

1760
01:44:48,178 --> 01:44:53,706
the licensee folder were used for things

1761
01:44:53,706 --> 01:44:55,529
that you build on if you

1762
01:44:55,529 --> 01:44:57,772
did import of a library from

1763
01:44:57,772 --> 01:44:59,976
somewhere else that you had

1764
01:44:59,976 --> 01:45:01,858
that license for that library

1765
01:45:01,858 --> 01:45:05,611
for instance that folder um

1766
01:45:05,611 --> 01:45:07,934
exactly that that that if

1767
01:45:07,934 --> 01:45:12,519
i because sometimes you uh

1768
01:45:13,901 --> 01:45:14,742
let's take the example of

1769
01:45:14,742 --> 01:45:15,983
python sometimes you can pip

1770
01:45:15,983 --> 01:45:17,825
install whatever you need and import it

1771
01:45:17,825 --> 01:45:20,448
but sometimes you take a bit of code

1772
01:45:20,448 --> 01:45:21,850
that was in some appendix of

1773
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:24,173
a paper with an mit license

1774
01:45:24,173 --> 01:45:26,135
but you can't pip install it

1775
01:45:26,135 --> 01:45:27,096
so then you will need to

1776
01:45:27,096 --> 01:45:29,299
include that bit of code and

1777
01:45:29,299 --> 01:45:30,780
this component that you add you

1778
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:32,122
also need to have the

1779
01:45:32,122 --> 01:45:34,205
MIT license for that component.

1780
01:45:34,205 --> 01:45:35,206
So if you start building

1781
01:45:35,206 --> 01:45:36,468
a code, then inside the

1782
01:45:36,468 --> 01:45:37,770
same repository would have all

1783
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:40,874
these other codes, not just import on linking.

1784
01:45:41,796 --> 01:45:42,557
Then you also need to

1785
01:45:42,557 --> 01:45:46,302
include these other people's licenses.

1786
01:45:46,302 --> 01:45:47,824
So I don't know if this clarifies.

1787
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:56,256
Okay, then we'll discuss software citation.

1788
01:45:58,379 --> 01:46:00,462
We start with some basic questions here.

1789
01:46:01,864 --> 01:46:03,706
Is putting software on GitHub

1790
01:46:03,706 --> 01:46:05,228
the GitLab publishing?

1791
01:46:08,172 --> 01:46:10,675
Or where to publish software

1792
01:46:10,675 --> 01:46:12,578
and how can software be cited?

1793
01:46:15,342 --> 01:46:17,805
How can I make my software citable?

1794
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:23,404
So we learned about the

1795
01:46:23,404 --> 01:46:26,529
FAIR principles in the previous

1796
01:46:26,529 --> 01:46:28,011
code refinery lecture.

1797
01:46:29,914 --> 01:46:34,901
So we're now talking about the FAIR,

1798
01:46:34,901 --> 01:46:37,585
how to get the FAIR principles

1799
01:46:37,585 --> 01:46:39,568
to apply for software.

1800
01:46:42,392 --> 01:46:44,836
So is it enough to make

1801
01:46:44,836 --> 01:46:46,278
the code public for the codes

1802
01:46:46,278 --> 01:46:49,142
to remain findable and accessible?

1803
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,256
Well, we don't know what happens to GitHub.

1804
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:55,593
GitHub has been around for

1805
01:46:55,593 --> 01:46:56,500
a very long time.

1806
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:02,445
and github repositories can

1807
01:47:02,445 --> 01:47:07,030
be deleted accounts can be deleted

1808
01:47:09,492 --> 01:47:11,855
so we have to make a step

1809
01:47:11,855 --> 01:47:14,578
if we want our software and

1810
01:47:14,578 --> 01:47:16,279
the software that we depend on

1811
01:47:16,279 --> 01:47:21,505
to be to be persistent

1812
01:47:21,505 --> 01:47:25,289
we need to use a service like Zenodo

1813
01:47:25,289 --> 01:47:27,492
and get a digital object

1814
01:47:27,492 --> 01:47:34,319
identifier related to the software.

1815
01:47:42,429 --> 01:47:44,571
Yes, so we can have a

1816
01:47:44,571 --> 01:47:47,795
short discussion in the chat or

1817
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,977
not the chat, but on the shared document.

1818
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:52,612
yeah i can copy this too

1819
01:47:52,612 --> 01:47:54,855
yeah do you cite your software and

1820
01:47:54,855 --> 01:47:57,618
how and if i wanted to

1821
01:47:57,618 --> 01:48:00,141
cite your code scripts what would

1822
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:05,287
i need to do so i pasted

1823
01:48:05,287 --> 01:48:13,677
these two questions in the notes document

1824
01:48:13,677 --> 01:48:17,662
so you can now those who

1825
01:48:17,662 --> 01:48:18,964
are watching the stream and

1826
01:48:18,964 --> 01:48:20,706
have the notes document open you can

1827
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,721
Add your answers.

1828
01:48:25,685 --> 01:48:26,987
Yes, I might say [name]'s

1829
01:48:26,987 --> 01:48:30,232
voice is not coming for me.

1830
01:48:30,232 --> 01:48:31,053
It's fine.

1831
01:48:31,053 --> 01:48:32,735
It could also be this Twitch TV

1832
01:48:32,735 --> 01:48:35,499
that you need to set the

1833
01:48:35,499 --> 01:48:38,122
quality of the Twitch TV stream to source.

1834
01:48:38,122 --> 01:48:40,386
Otherwise Twitch will forever

1835
01:48:40,386 --> 01:48:42,008
compress video and audio.

1836
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:44,331
So if that helps.

1837
01:48:54,183 --> 01:48:56,025
All right, so do you cite

1838
01:48:56,025 --> 01:48:58,448
software that you use and how?

1839
01:48:58,448 --> 01:48:59,950
Let's see what people are writing.

1840
01:49:01,192 --> 01:49:02,293
What about you, [name]?

1841
01:49:02,293 --> 01:49:04,757
How could I cite your software?

1842
01:49:05,738 --> 01:49:07,460
Well, at least in my

1843
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:08,361
field, my background is in

1844
01:49:08,361 --> 01:49:11,585
neuroscience, the usual practice,

1845
01:49:11,585 --> 01:49:13,087
or I don't know if it's the best practice,

1846
01:49:13,087 --> 01:49:14,869
but people write papers about

1847
01:49:14,869 --> 01:49:17,072
the software or then they

1848
01:49:17,072 --> 01:49:18,434
want a specific paper to be

1849
01:49:18,434 --> 01:49:21,097
cited when the software is used.

1850
01:49:21,097 --> 01:49:23,140
It's not maybe the most...

1851
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:24,462
how can I say research

1852
01:49:24,462 --> 01:49:27,407
software engineering best way of

1853
01:49:27,407 --> 01:49:30,031
doing it I guess the reason

1854
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:33,737
is to maximize citations to some papers

1855
01:49:33,737 --> 01:49:35,119
so I've seen in neuroscience

1856
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:36,801
that there are some papers of

1857
01:49:36,801 --> 01:49:38,384
these usual tools used for

1858
01:49:38,384 --> 01:49:40,267
statistics that they have I don't

1859
01:49:40,267 --> 01:49:43,492
know 10 000 citations just because you know

1860
01:49:43,492 --> 01:49:45,658
maybe this most likely people

1861
01:49:45,658 --> 01:49:46,641
who are citing those papers

1862
01:49:46,641 --> 01:49:48,527
they don't didn't even read the papers

1863
01:49:48,527 --> 01:49:50,071
but because whatever you use

1864
01:49:50,071 --> 01:49:53,181
the tool you cite the paper

1865
01:49:53,181 --> 01:49:55,287
so this is what they do

1866
01:49:55,287 --> 01:49:57,012
in neuroscience at least yeah

1867
01:50:00,653 --> 01:50:02,175
But if I wanted to cite

1868
01:50:02,175 --> 01:50:04,959
your code script, what would I need to do?

1869
01:50:04,959 --> 01:50:06,121
Yeah, so there people are

1870
01:50:06,121 --> 01:50:07,723
writing, citing the paper.

1871
01:50:07,723 --> 01:50:09,145
I think what I've seen, I don't know

1872
01:50:09,145 --> 01:50:10,967
if you ever noticed, sometimes

1873
01:50:10,967 --> 01:50:13,551
in the readme file of the

1874
01:50:13,551 --> 01:50:16,776
GitHub, they might write something like,

1875
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:17,697
if you find this code

1876
01:50:17,697 --> 01:50:20,220
useful, please cite conference

1877
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:22,704
paper or whatever, journal article.

1878
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,293
So yeah, this is kind of,

1879
01:50:33,205 --> 01:50:34,567
Of course, all checks that

1880
01:50:34,567 --> 01:50:36,769
people do cite in those

1881
01:50:36,769 --> 01:50:39,833
papers, that's a different story.

1882
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:49,504
So how to make your software citable?

1883
01:50:51,767 --> 01:50:52,488
Yes.

1884
01:50:52,488 --> 01:50:54,811
So here's a checklist for

1885
01:50:54,811 --> 01:50:57,254
making a release of your software citable.

1886
01:50:59,056 --> 01:51:00,377
We talked about assigning

1887
01:51:00,377 --> 01:51:01,879
appropriate license.

1888
01:51:03,293 --> 01:51:04,835
a description of the

1889
01:51:04,835 --> 01:51:07,679
software, clear version numbering,

1890
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:12,264
author's credit, a persistent identifier,

1891
01:51:12,264 --> 01:51:16,750
and added a recommended citation

1892
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:20,274
to the software documentation, often

1893
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:21,316
in the README file.

1894
01:51:23,098 --> 01:51:24,460
We have an example of

1895
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:28,785
a citation.csf file that can be

1896
01:51:28,785 --> 01:51:31,208
added to the repository.

1897
01:51:32,369 --> 01:51:33,771
Should I check this example?

1898
01:51:36,415 --> 01:51:38,178
It's further down there, isn't it?

1899
01:51:38,178 --> 01:51:39,359
Yeah, there you have it.

1900
01:51:40,421 --> 01:51:43,546
So a message, if you use this software,

1901
01:51:43,546 --> 01:51:46,550
please cite it as below, and the author,

1902
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:55,724
title, version, and date, and

1903
01:51:55,724 --> 01:52:00,030
the digital object identifier also.

1904
01:52:02,002 --> 01:52:04,985
So then this citation CFF,

1905
01:52:04,985 --> 01:52:08,008
it's like a machine readable citation

1906
01:52:08,829 --> 01:52:12,313
that then it makes it

1907
01:52:12,313 --> 01:52:16,817
easier, for example, to track

1908
01:52:16,817 --> 01:52:18,439
which software is cited then.

1909
01:52:18,439 --> 01:52:25,346
I go back to the webpage of the course.

1910
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:29,450
And then how to get

1911
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:31,232
the digital object identifier.

1912
01:52:32,393 --> 01:52:33,334
because you were mentioning

1913
01:52:33,334 --> 01:52:34,436
that it's important.

1914
01:52:34,436 --> 01:52:37,239
You did that in, what was

1915
01:52:37,239 --> 01:52:40,483
it, day three of the

1916
01:52:40,483 --> 01:52:44,749
macro refinery course, where you got

1917
01:52:44,749 --> 01:52:47,692
a DOI from Senodo, I think.

1918
01:52:48,774 --> 01:52:49,655
Or was it day four?

1919
01:52:49,655 --> 01:52:54,821
Yeah, in day four, it's mentioned.

1920
01:52:54,821 --> 01:52:56,984
But in general, if we have

1921
01:52:56,984 --> 01:53:00,308
a look at this example here,

1922
01:53:01,992 --> 01:53:06,324
Zenodo is a tool that is very useful

1923
01:53:06,324 --> 01:53:08,570
for sharing anything, can be your slides,

1924
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:11,559
can be your code and the

1925
01:53:11,559 --> 01:53:14,427
interface is very intuitive that

1926
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:16,994
you can basically

1927
01:53:16,994 --> 01:53:19,717
create a new object in

1928
01:53:19,717 --> 01:53:22,480
this specific case would be a repository code.

1929
01:53:23,381 --> 01:53:24,303
And then you can get the

1930
01:53:24,303 --> 01:53:28,427
DOI and kind of this persistent identifier.

1931
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,250
Maybe I could ask for those

1932
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:32,212
who are writing in the notes that

1933
01:53:32,212 --> 01:53:33,473
if I know that in

1934
01:53:33,473 --> 01:53:35,275
different fields, they might

1935
01:53:35,275 --> 01:53:36,757
have other repositories.

1936
01:53:36,757 --> 01:53:38,439
So if there's something specific of some,

1937
01:53:39,901 --> 01:53:41,162
that is something field

1938
01:53:41,162 --> 01:53:42,664
specific, please let us know.

1939
01:53:46,087 --> 01:53:48,152
So, oh yeah, yeah, this is

1940
01:53:48,152 --> 01:53:50,216
the same example that I clicked.

1941
01:53:50,216 --> 01:53:51,199
Oh no, this is another

1942
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,902
more anonymous example.

1943
01:53:52,902 --> 01:53:54,767
Yeah.

1944
01:53:54,767 --> 01:53:55,849
You see, it's the same

1945
01:53:55,849 --> 01:53:57,312
thing mentioned here.

1946
01:53:58,836 --> 01:54:01,301
Yeah.

1947
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:02,965
Yes.

1948
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:07,737
So, and then we mentioned

1949
01:54:07,737 --> 01:54:09,483
there is papers that focus

1950
01:54:09,483 --> 01:54:12,793
on scientific software.

1951
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:15,622
So if you click the link,

1952
01:54:15,622 --> 01:54:16,325
we will get to the

1953
01:54:16,325 --> 01:54:18,692
Software Sustainable Institute.

1954
01:54:21,085 --> 01:54:24,053
And there's a long list

1955
01:54:24,053 --> 01:54:29,406
of different journals sorted by topic

1956
01:54:29,406 --> 01:54:32,013
or fields and engineering

1957
01:54:32,013 --> 01:54:35,682
humanities and different which are

1958
01:54:35,682 --> 01:54:37,086
you can publish software.

1959
01:54:40,795 --> 01:54:42,978
it's nice that this in a

1960
01:54:42,978 --> 01:54:44,279
way compared to the example

1961
01:54:44,279 --> 01:54:45,200
that i was mentioning from

1962
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:48,584
neuroscience it's i would rather

1963
01:54:48,584 --> 01:54:51,347
cite this paper that clearly explains

1964
01:54:51,347 --> 01:54:52,929
what the software does and

1965
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:55,452
what is novel rather than some

1966
01:54:56,413 --> 01:54:59,717
you know random paper that that

1967
01:54:59,717 --> 01:55:02,480
they tell me to to decide

1968
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,722
but then again i also see

1969
01:55:03,722 --> 01:55:05,745
that maybe this is a i don't know

1970
01:55:05,745 --> 01:55:07,527
how recent this practice it is

1971
01:55:07,527 --> 01:55:09,850
but um but i would say

1972
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:12,053
that now this type of

1973
01:55:12,053 --> 01:55:14,457
development work is recognized even

1974
01:55:14,457 --> 01:55:16,339
in doctoral thesis so that

1975
01:55:16,339 --> 01:55:17,741
there are doctoral thesis that

1976
01:55:18,603 --> 01:55:21,026
one paper is just a software

1977
01:55:21,026 --> 01:55:22,869
actually and it's good that

1978
01:55:22,869 --> 01:55:25,152
it's finally like this that

1979
01:55:25,152 --> 01:55:26,474
you know software is not some

1980
01:55:26,474 --> 01:55:29,598
sort of class b or or

1981
01:55:29,598 --> 01:55:32,184
product of the research

1982
01:55:32,184 --> 01:55:34,670
world, it's actually as important

1983
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:45,497
as other papers, as other type of work.

1984
01:55:47,485 --> 01:55:50,829
Yeah, so there are several sources on

1985
01:55:50,829 --> 01:55:53,532
how to decide software and we

1986
01:55:53,532 --> 01:55:57,297
also see the recommended format

1987
01:55:57,297 --> 01:55:59,780
that is shared by the different authors.

1988
01:56:03,004 --> 01:56:05,027
Coming to FAIR for research

1989
01:56:05,027 --> 01:56:09,652
software or FAIR for RS.

1990
01:56:11,515 --> 01:56:14,939
That's how to apply the

1991
01:56:14,939 --> 01:56:17,442
FAIR principles for research software.

1992
01:56:19,177 --> 01:56:22,506
Software should have a global

1993
01:56:22,506 --> 01:56:25,976
unique and persistent identifier, DOI.

1994
01:56:27,099 --> 01:56:28,283
It should be accessible, so

1995
01:56:29,225 --> 01:56:30,790
it should be retrievable by

1996
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:32,595
using open protocols.

1997
01:56:33,925 --> 01:56:35,126
Interruptible.

1998
01:56:35,126 --> 01:56:38,069
Software should use open

1999
01:56:38,069 --> 01:56:40,031
formats and standards to work

2000
01:56:40,031 --> 01:56:40,892
with other tools.

2001
01:56:42,013 --> 01:56:48,199
That's like CSV files or

2002
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:52,103
HDF4 and formats like that, NetCDF.

2003
01:56:53,344 --> 01:56:55,546
And it should be really usable.

2004
01:56:55,546 --> 01:56:56,407
Software should have a

2005
01:56:56,407 --> 01:56:59,190
clear licensing documentation and provenance.

2006
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:05,850
So there's a checklist, bare software,

2007
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:11,282
and bare software NL highlights

2008
01:57:11,282 --> 01:57:12,866
with nice visuals, the five

2009
01:57:12,866 --> 01:57:17,517
most important elements of bare software.

2010
01:57:18,509 --> 01:57:19,631
I really like this.

2011
01:57:19,631 --> 01:57:22,917
In a way, this FAIR principle

2012
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:24,440
for research software are really

2013
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:27,926
the core summary of these lessons

2014
01:57:27,926 --> 01:57:30,711
that if your software, if

2015
01:57:30,711 --> 01:57:31,853
whatever you're going to publish

2016
01:57:31,853 --> 01:57:33,737
along with your paper has

2017
01:57:33,737 --> 01:57:35,981
these elements, then you know

2018
01:57:35,981 --> 01:57:37,163
that you're fine and you

2019
01:57:37,163 --> 01:57:39,046
know that everything is in order.

2020
01:57:39,046 --> 01:57:40,188
I like this website here,

2021
01:57:40,188 --> 01:57:42,252
this FAIR software.

2022
01:57:42,252 --> 01:57:44,515
in from the Netherlands that

2023
01:57:44,515 --> 01:57:49,442
it's a nice visual website and they you know

2024
01:57:49,442 --> 01:57:51,225
if you spend time it's not

2025
01:57:51,225 --> 01:57:52,507
gonna take too long you can

2026
01:57:52,507 --> 01:57:54,750
they also guide you you know

2027
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:56,332
how to choose a license so

2028
01:57:56,332 --> 01:57:59,377
it's they're very good kind

2029
01:57:59,377 --> 01:58:04,564
of basic but fundamental important information

2030
01:58:05,624 --> 01:58:09,669
so let me go back we

2031
01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:12,212
basically have covered everything

2032
01:58:12,212 --> 01:58:16,397
so far i wonder should we

2033
01:58:16,397 --> 01:58:17,798
already have a break now

2034
01:58:17,798 --> 01:58:20,221
and then basically this is the

2035
01:58:20,221 --> 01:58:24,426
last part of our lesson and then

2036
01:58:24,426 --> 01:58:25,387
we can finish a little bit

2037
01:58:25,387 --> 01:58:26,809
earlier should we do like that

2038
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:29,958
yeah you can do it like that

2039
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:31,461
so let's have another 10

2040
01:58:31,461 --> 01:58:32,703
minutes break we will finish

2041
01:58:32,703 --> 01:58:34,786
a little bit earlier today so

2042
01:58:34,786 --> 01:58:35,828
that you have more time to

2043
01:58:35,828 --> 01:58:37,511
explore all the links that we

2044
01:58:37,511 --> 01:58:40,316
are throwing to you and so

2045
01:58:40,316 --> 01:58:42,019
let's get back to the streaming

2046
01:58:42,019 --> 01:58:50,734
at 10 to the hour so whatever 50. okay bye

2047
02:08:27,367 --> 02:08:32,479
and welcome back so now it's

2048
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:35,026
the last part if we have

2049
02:08:35,026 --> 02:08:37,592
a look at the structure of this episode

2050
02:08:37,592 --> 02:08:39,637
that we covered today we

2051
02:08:39,637 --> 02:08:40,840
talked about the kind of

2052
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:43,887
general motivation of social coding

2053
02:08:43,887 --> 02:08:47,391
then we went deeper on the licenses

2054
02:08:47,391 --> 02:08:50,094
and software licensing and then

2055
02:08:50,094 --> 02:08:52,557
we wrapped up with the software citation

2056
02:08:52,557 --> 02:08:54,579
and kind of a practical checklist

2057
02:08:54,579 --> 02:08:57,482
for you on how to cite

2058
02:08:58,744 --> 02:09:00,846
in this last 20 minutes together

2059
02:09:00,846 --> 02:09:02,869
we want just to mention also

2060
02:09:02,869 --> 02:09:05,131
that sharing data is closely

2061
02:09:05,131 --> 02:09:09,316
related to software but the

2062
02:09:09,316 --> 02:09:12,119
tools that we might use for sharing data

2063
02:09:12,119 --> 02:09:13,521
they are a little bit

2064
02:09:13,521 --> 02:09:15,865
different of course you might have seen

2065
02:09:15,865 --> 02:09:18,490
that in some python libraries

2066
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:20,814
or even maybe in your own code

2067
02:09:20,814 --> 02:09:22,176
if the data is very small

2068
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:24,740
in a way there's nothing wrong

2069
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:27,265
to you know attach a little

2070
02:09:27,265 --> 02:09:30,530
csv into the same github repository

2071
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:32,213
but from a kind of

2072
02:09:32,213 --> 02:09:35,057
metadata findability fair principle

2073
02:09:35,057 --> 02:09:37,881
point of view depositing the data

2074
02:09:37,881 --> 02:09:40,185
in a data specific repository

2075
02:09:40,185 --> 02:09:43,270
makes it easier for others to find it

2076
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:44,351
because if i'm looking for a

2077
02:09:44,351 --> 02:09:46,615
data set most likely i search

2078
02:09:46,615 --> 02:09:49,379
in a data repository and not on github

2079
02:09:49,379 --> 02:09:52,143
So a very useful website

2080
02:09:52,143 --> 02:09:55,128
is this read3data which is like

2081
02:09:55,128 --> 02:09:58,993
a list of all possible registry

2082
02:09:58,993 --> 02:10:01,857
to where they post the data.

2083
02:10:01,857 --> 02:10:05,222
There are some generic repositories

2084
02:10:05,222 --> 02:10:08,988
of data that we list here for example this

2085
02:10:08,988 --> 02:10:11,010
Zenodo that we mentioned earlier

2086
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:13,313
but in some specific fields

2087
02:10:13,313 --> 02:10:17,137
there might be a field specific repository

2088
02:10:17,137 --> 02:10:18,038
for example in the case

2089
02:10:18,038 --> 02:10:19,880
of neuroscience there is OpenNeuro

2090
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:21,822
in the United States and so

2091
02:10:21,822 --> 02:10:23,003
there you might find with

2092
02:10:23,003 --> 02:10:25,426
this search engine for data

2093
02:10:25,426 --> 02:10:26,967
repositories you might find the

2094
02:10:26,967 --> 02:10:30,050
right one for your case.

2095
02:10:31,032 --> 02:10:32,393
CodeRefinery

2096
02:10:32,393 --> 02:10:35,196
although we have participants

2097
02:10:35,196 --> 02:10:38,100
from everywhere but at least

2098
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:40,663
we are strongly involved with the nordics

2099
02:10:42,185 --> 02:10:43,747
and there's a list here

2100
02:10:43,747 --> 02:10:47,071
of some available repositories in

2101
02:10:47,071 --> 02:10:48,993
sweden norway denmark and finland

2102
02:10:50,235 --> 02:10:53,298
in general if you are not

2103
02:10:53,298 --> 02:10:57,844
sure get in touch with your local support people

2104
02:10:59,478 --> 02:11:02,343
Basically, when it comes to

2105
02:11:02,343 --> 02:11:06,811
the licenses of data, licensing of datasets

2106
02:11:06,811 --> 02:11:10,237
and databases, they are a

2107
02:11:10,237 --> 02:11:12,361
little bit different than the

2108
02:11:12,361 --> 02:11:14,665
licenses that we have.

2109
02:11:14,665 --> 02:11:19,853
consider right now so in there

2110
02:11:19,853 --> 02:11:24,059
is there are basically this

2111
02:11:24,059 --> 02:11:26,463
type of creative common licenses

2112
02:11:26,463 --> 02:11:28,265
which one could consider that

2113
02:11:28,265 --> 02:11:30,248
they are like the open

2114
02:11:30,248 --> 02:11:31,670
software license open source

2115
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:36,337
software licenses for data and

2116
02:11:36,337 --> 02:11:41,145
maybe it's worth spending maybe

2117
02:11:41,145 --> 02:11:43,555
this is not the best website to show

2118
02:11:43,555 --> 02:11:44,417
But in general, the

2119
02:11:44,417 --> 02:11:46,581
Creative Commons licenses, they

2120
02:11:46,581 --> 02:11:49,908
also allow this type of, how

2121
02:11:49,908 --> 02:11:52,153
can I call it, viral component.

2122
02:11:52,153 --> 02:11:54,157
So you might be releasing something

2123
02:11:54,157 --> 02:11:56,902
that is completely public domain

2124
02:11:56,902 --> 02:11:58,586
and that's the CC0.

2125
02:11:58,586 --> 02:11:59,728
So the data that you

2126
02:11:59,728 --> 02:12:02,995
publish, anyone can use it for any purpose.

2127
02:12:02,995 --> 02:12:06,361
or then very common in research

2128
02:12:06,361 --> 02:12:07,884
is the CC BY and the

2129
02:12:07,884 --> 02:12:09,547
BY would basically mean that

2130
02:12:09,547 --> 02:12:11,751
people have to specify where they

2131
02:12:11,751 --> 02:12:13,334
got the data so cite your

2132
02:12:13,334 --> 02:12:17,342
paper or mention the dataset and

2133
02:12:17,342 --> 02:12:19,967
more strict it goes towards the

2134
02:12:20,828 --> 02:12:23,954
CC BY SA which stands for share alike

2135
02:12:23,954 --> 02:12:27,479
So that if you reuse that

2136
02:12:27,479 --> 02:12:31,966
data, then you need to also for your data,

2137
02:12:31,966 --> 02:12:33,228
you need to also basically

2138
02:12:33,228 --> 02:12:36,854
release it with the same license.

2139
02:12:36,854 --> 02:12:38,276
And the most strict one would be

2140
02:12:38,276 --> 02:12:41,782
that there's no commercial, how

2141
02:12:41,782 --> 02:12:43,324
can I say, work that can be

2142
02:12:43,324 --> 02:12:44,646
done with that type of data.

2143
02:12:46,162 --> 02:12:51,114
Maybe very briefly, in the

2144
02:12:51,114 --> 02:12:55,245
previous rounds of these episodes

2145
02:12:55,245 --> 02:12:56,147
there have been always

2146
02:12:56,147 --> 02:12:57,531
questions, often questions when it

2147
02:12:57,531 --> 02:12:59,696
comes to the licensing of

2148
02:12:59,696 --> 02:13:02,463
machine learning and AI models.

2149
02:13:02,463 --> 02:13:05,009
So when it comes to data,

2150
02:13:05,009 --> 02:13:06,793
AI models are a little bit

2151
02:13:07,956 --> 02:13:12,547
tricky that it's not clear if

2152
02:13:12,547 --> 02:13:15,875
an AI model is considered data

2153
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:18,562
or if the AI model is considered software.

2154
02:13:18,562 --> 02:13:20,886
Maybe it's good to define what

2155
02:13:20,886 --> 02:13:22,650
we mean is the AI model in

2156
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:24,473
the metaphor of the car that

2157
02:13:24,473 --> 02:13:25,615
I already used earlier.

2158
02:13:25,615 --> 02:13:26,797
So the AI model is like

2159
02:13:26,797 --> 02:13:28,240
the engine of the car.

2160
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:31,185
And so the model on its

2161
02:13:31,185 --> 02:13:34,812
own, it can go anywhere, it can kill anyone.

2162
02:13:34,812 --> 02:13:36,314
But once the AI model is

2163
02:13:36,314 --> 02:13:39,279
put inside an AI system, so

2164
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:40,521
it's like the engine goes

2165
02:13:40,521 --> 02:13:42,384
inside the whole infrastructure of

2166
02:13:42,384 --> 02:13:44,767
the car and the software, then

2167
02:13:44,767 --> 02:13:46,230
it becomes an AI system.

2168
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:51,638
And then it can actually be used.

2169
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:55,003
So for those of you who

2170
02:13:55,003 --> 02:13:57,307
develop AI models and AI systems,

2171
02:13:57,307 --> 02:14:00,911
there are or let's say

2172
02:14:00,911 --> 02:14:02,834
that people are still figuring out

2173
02:14:02,834 --> 02:14:04,516
what is the best way to

2174
02:14:04,516 --> 02:14:09,221
release these AI models and the

2175
02:14:09,221 --> 02:14:11,584
I guess most famous examples

2176
02:14:11,584 --> 02:14:13,006
of shared AI models are

2177
02:14:13,006 --> 02:14:15,149
large language models because of

2178
02:14:15,149 --> 02:14:16,490
what has happened with the AI

2179
02:14:16,490 --> 02:14:18,012
hype in the past two years

2180
02:14:18,012 --> 02:14:20,298
And so if you know GitHub,

2181
02:14:20,298 --> 02:14:21,942
if you've been experiencing with GitHub

2182
02:14:21,942 --> 02:14:24,488
for sharing code, Hugging Face

2183
02:14:24,488 --> 02:14:28,498
is like the GitHub of AI models.

2184
02:14:28,498 --> 02:14:29,802
I will show now one example

2185
02:14:29,802 --> 02:14:33,571
of this Olmo model.

2186
02:14:33,571 --> 02:14:35,475
model, large language model by

2187
02:14:35,475 --> 02:14:38,862
the Allen Institute is one of the few

2188
02:14:38,862 --> 02:14:41,869
that is truly open in the sense

2189
02:14:41,869 --> 02:14:44,835
that they disclosed everything,

2190
02:14:44,835 --> 02:14:45,857
the training data, the

2191
02:14:45,857 --> 02:14:48,202
training process, checkpoints and all

2192
02:14:48,202 --> 02:14:48,944
sorts of that.

2193
02:14:48,944 --> 02:14:50,266
And so you see, of course,

2194
02:14:50,266 --> 02:14:51,207
this is Hacking Phase.

2195
02:14:51,207 --> 02:14:53,751
It doesn't really look like GitHub,

2196
02:14:54,652 --> 02:14:57,817
but there are basically the files

2197
02:14:57,817 --> 02:15:00,842
and kind of the key version

2198
02:15:00,842 --> 02:15:02,664
of the model, because in the

2199
02:15:02,664 --> 02:15:06,770
end, the AI model will be just a gigantic file.

2200
02:15:08,072 --> 02:15:10,876
And so if I click on

2201
02:15:10,876 --> 02:15:13,320
files here, you see that these

2202
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:15,904
are all the files that are

2203
02:15:15,904 --> 02:15:18,087
distributed with this AI model.

2204
02:15:18,087 --> 02:15:19,951
The actual model, so the

2205
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:24,041
weights, is basically this PyTorch bin

2206
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:25,685
or whatever safe tensor, so

2207
02:15:25,685 --> 02:15:27,750
this really big file, but then

2208
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:29,715
there are other metadata files

2209
02:15:29,715 --> 02:15:31,720
that might be needed.

2210
02:15:33,584 --> 02:15:35,128
The training data is there

2211
02:15:35,128 --> 02:15:36,582
as well, you said?

2212
02:15:36,582 --> 02:15:37,123
Yeah.

2213
02:15:37,123 --> 02:15:38,826
So in their paper, they,

2214
02:15:38,826 --> 02:15:40,028
I don't think they, the training

2215
02:15:40,028 --> 02:15:41,831
data is now in this specific

2216
02:15:41,831 --> 02:15:43,394
link that I'm showing right now.

2217
02:15:43,394 --> 02:15:44,476
This is just for the release

2218
02:15:44,476 --> 02:15:47,481
of the model, but they also have a repository.

2219
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:48,563
I think it's, they have it

2220
02:15:48,563 --> 02:15:50,427
even in, in again phase.

2221
02:15:50,427 --> 02:15:51,929
So in this, under this Allen

2222
02:15:51,929 --> 02:15:53,933
AI is the Allen Institute.

2223
02:15:54,892 --> 02:15:56,594
actually the model this model

2224
02:15:56,594 --> 02:15:58,716
was trained on the lumi supercomputer

2225
02:15:58,716 --> 02:16:01,680
so it's one of the products

2226
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:05,504
of the eu ai factories but

2227
02:16:05,504 --> 02:16:10,029
anyway back to the content so

2228
02:16:10,029 --> 02:16:11,851
so this ai models it's a

2229
02:16:11,851 --> 02:16:14,655
bit difficult to if they would

2230
02:16:14,655 --> 02:16:16,196
be called data or if they

2231
02:16:16,196 --> 02:16:17,538
would be called software

2232
02:16:17,538 --> 02:16:20,005
But at least the AI models

2233
02:16:20,005 --> 02:16:21,569
that you see in AgInPhase, they

2234
02:16:21,569 --> 02:16:25,580
are now released under software licenses.

2235
02:16:26,924 --> 02:16:30,173
It's also a bit, I would

2236
02:16:30,173 --> 02:16:31,617
say, kind of funny.

2237
02:16:31,617 --> 02:16:33,502
I don't know if funny is the right word.

2238
02:16:33,502 --> 02:16:36,226
many of these AI models

2239
02:16:36,226 --> 02:16:38,670
they are considered open source model

2240
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:40,953
but actually when one really goes

2241
02:16:40,953 --> 02:16:43,156
and check there's nothing open

2242
02:16:43,156 --> 02:16:44,739
source at all so even

2243
02:16:44,739 --> 02:16:47,844
the various Facebook meta or

2244
02:16:47,844 --> 02:16:49,406
whatever big tech that is

2245
02:16:49,406 --> 02:16:50,467
releasing these open source

2246
02:16:50,467 --> 02:16:52,070
models actually everything is

2247
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:54,173
quite kept proprietary

2248
02:16:54,173 --> 02:16:55,735
but as there is this kind

2249
02:16:55,735 --> 02:16:57,658
of open washing so that by

2250
02:16:57,658 --> 02:16:59,181
attaching the label open source

2251
02:17:00,162 --> 02:17:02,606
they can think that they can

2252
02:17:02,606 --> 02:17:05,190
get away with whatever secret

2253
02:17:05,190 --> 02:17:07,173
practices but the lack of

2254
02:17:07,173 --> 02:17:11,099
transparencies and so on and compared to

2255
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:12,442
of course there's no

2256
02:17:12,442 --> 02:17:15,190
authority forcing these companies

2257
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:19,862
to change their practice exactly

2258
02:17:19,862 --> 02:17:21,687
so you can they can just

2259
02:17:21,687 --> 02:17:24,955
use the open licenses as much

2260
02:17:24,955 --> 02:17:26,860
as they want so it's not

2261
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:29,647
it's actually this this paper

2262
02:17:29,647 --> 02:17:31,913
that i linked here for those

2263
02:17:31,913 --> 02:17:34,260
who it's it's also you know

2264
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:36,425
this type of open washi in

2265
02:17:36,425 --> 02:17:39,494
the au artificial intelligence act

2266
02:17:39,494 --> 02:17:43,043
which i will cover briefly soon

2267
02:17:43,043 --> 02:17:46,910
that it's also exactly this

2268
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:49,275
that maybe this regulation that we

2269
02:17:49,275 --> 02:17:52,160
now have in Europe to regulate AI models

2270
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:56,248
and AI systems is using open source

2271
02:17:56,248 --> 02:17:57,210
even in the text of the

2272
02:17:57,210 --> 02:17:58,813
regulation in a way that is

2273
02:17:58,813 --> 02:18:01,879
not what we've been discussing today

2274
02:18:01,879 --> 02:18:03,061
and in the previous episodes

2275
02:18:03,061 --> 02:18:04,444
of Code Refinery Workshop.

2276
02:18:05,926 --> 02:18:09,832
But anyway, of course, I

2277
02:18:09,832 --> 02:18:12,116
would understand that there's maybe

2278
02:18:12,116 --> 02:18:13,898
a minority of you who will

2279
02:18:13,898 --> 02:18:17,283
develop AI models and release AI models,

2280
02:18:18,245 --> 02:18:19,928
but in general, as I

2281
02:18:19,928 --> 02:18:21,510
just mentioned, for those of you

2282
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:23,965
who are doing research

2283
02:18:23,965 --> 02:18:26,569
this type of regulations that

2284
02:18:26,569 --> 02:18:29,953
don't apply so for researchers

2285
02:18:29,953 --> 02:18:30,935
in practice you don't need to

2286
02:18:30,935 --> 02:18:33,158
worry about AI regulation but

2287
02:18:33,158 --> 02:18:35,221
you might still need to worry about ethics

2288
02:18:35,221 --> 02:18:36,542
that if you're building a model

2289
02:18:36,542 --> 02:18:39,346
that I don't know is

2290
02:18:39,346 --> 02:18:42,050
for operating automatically some

2291
02:18:42,050 --> 02:18:44,794
drone machine gun maybe you know

2292
02:18:44,794 --> 02:18:46,036
do you really need to do

2293
02:18:46,036 --> 02:18:47,518
that can you do something else

2294
02:18:47,518 --> 02:18:49,160
with your clever brain

2295
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:53,606
So this of course is you are the judge

2296
02:18:53,606 --> 02:18:55,408
and your community is the judge

2297
02:18:55,408 --> 02:18:56,730
of what is good and what is wrong.

2298
02:18:57,891 --> 02:18:59,574
But in general researchers have

2299
02:18:59,574 --> 02:19:02,077
the freedom even under the EU

2300
02:19:02,077 --> 02:19:04,460
AI Act to explore what they want.

2301
02:19:05,642 --> 02:19:07,724
The kind of open questions that

2302
02:19:07,724 --> 02:19:09,747
is with the data.

2303
02:19:09,747 --> 02:19:12,490
that is inside these big AI

2304
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:14,892
models it has been shown that

2305
02:19:14,892 --> 02:19:16,374
you can actually that these

2306
02:19:16,374 --> 02:19:18,976
large models they can memorize

2307
02:19:18,976 --> 02:19:22,200
some of the training data and if you

2308
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,621
what we were saying earlier that

2309
02:19:23,621 --> 02:19:24,922
even with the code that

2310
02:19:24,922 --> 02:19:26,504
you might generate from some

2311
02:19:26,504 --> 02:19:28,166
large language models there is

2312
02:19:28,166 --> 02:19:29,867
a two percent chance that some

2313
02:19:29,867 --> 02:19:31,489
of the code that it spits

2314
02:19:31,489 --> 02:19:34,492
is basically verbatim copy paste

2315
02:19:34,492 --> 02:19:36,494
of existing code

2316
02:19:36,494 --> 02:19:37,717
and of course this raises

2317
02:19:37,717 --> 02:19:42,306
concerns about copyright materials

2318
02:19:42,306 --> 02:19:44,972
or you know copyleft licenses

2319
02:19:44,972 --> 02:19:46,114
when it comes to the code

2320
02:19:46,114 --> 02:19:47,858
or any other stuff that is

2321
02:19:47,858 --> 02:19:52,559
inside these models right now there's no

2322
02:19:52,559 --> 02:19:55,222
decisions the companies for

2323
02:19:55,222 --> 02:19:56,864
example the large new york

2324
02:19:56,864 --> 02:19:58,746
time and whatever these big

2325
02:19:58,746 --> 02:19:59,968
publishers they are trying to

2326
02:19:59,968 --> 02:20:03,652
sue their companies for misuse

2327
02:20:03,652 --> 02:20:07,396
of copyright materials and but

2328
02:20:07,396 --> 02:20:11,842
right now there's no how can i say judgment

2329
02:20:11,842 --> 02:20:13,664
or final final verdict there

2330
02:20:13,664 --> 02:20:16,207
was recently some big fine

2331
02:20:16,207 --> 02:20:17,548
to anthropic like really in

2332
02:20:17,548 --> 02:20:20,031
the order of billions but

2333
02:20:20,031 --> 02:20:22,414
they are still pending so

2334
02:20:23,744 --> 02:20:25,030
because apparently they used

2335
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:27,803
some books that they shouldn't

2336
02:20:27,803 --> 02:20:30,656
even have had access to to

2337
02:20:30,656 --> 02:20:31,881
train their AI model.

2338
02:20:33,481 --> 02:20:36,804
all right but the ending part

2339
02:20:37,785 --> 02:20:38,946
in the way we went quite

2340
02:20:38,946 --> 02:20:42,890
quickly in this data kind of licensing

2341
02:20:42,890 --> 02:20:43,831
because it goes a bit

2342
02:20:44,732 --> 02:20:50,037
beyond code refinery but it's something

2343
02:20:50,037 --> 02:20:51,238
that is very important

2344
02:20:51,238 --> 02:20:52,980
many universities they cover this

2345
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:54,862
type of data management and

2346
02:20:54,862 --> 02:20:57,584
opening data workshops so I

2347
02:20:57,584 --> 02:21:00,447
highly recommend you to check what your

2348
02:21:00,447 --> 02:21:03,250
organizations are are for

2349
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:04,432
example suggesting when it

2350
02:21:04,432 --> 02:21:07,675
comes to repositories for data

2351
02:21:07,675 --> 02:21:09,137
and here in this final

2352
02:21:09,137 --> 02:21:12,280
list of references there's very

2353
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:14,543
very good tools and very good

2354
02:21:14,543 --> 02:21:16,285
resources i'm a huge fan of

2355
02:21:16,285 --> 02:21:18,307
the touring way which is like

2356
02:21:18,307 --> 02:21:22,452
an open ebook that covers all these topics

2357
02:21:22,452 --> 02:21:25,915
and um and in general i

2358
02:21:25,915 --> 02:21:27,277
mean there are also field

2359
02:21:27,277 --> 02:21:29,078
field specific things so try

2360
02:21:29,078 --> 02:21:33,542
to try to basically check for your field

2361
02:21:33,542 --> 02:21:36,725
if there's something specific right

2362
02:21:36,725 --> 02:21:38,367
so we're basically done with

2363
02:21:38,367 --> 02:21:42,371
this episode we this was a

2364
02:21:42,371 --> 02:21:43,912
bit of a different episode compared

2365
02:21:43,912 --> 02:21:45,073
to the other ones in the

2366
02:21:45,073 --> 02:21:47,836
code refinery because it was

2367
02:21:47,836 --> 02:21:49,017
more discussion based

2368
02:21:50,245 --> 02:21:53,272
I can already ask [name], for example,

2369
02:21:53,272 --> 02:21:54,936
if you could paste to

2370
02:21:54,936 --> 02:21:58,464
the notes the feedback for today.

2371
02:22:00,328 --> 02:22:02,854
Yes, just a moment.

2372
02:22:03,745 --> 02:22:05,729
and of course there might be questions

2373
02:22:05,729 --> 02:22:07,653
that we didn't answer we

2374
02:22:07,653 --> 02:22:09,718
will answer you know we will

2375
02:22:09,718 --> 02:22:13,225
not forget your unanswered questions

2376
02:22:13,225 --> 02:22:16,392
we will come back to those maybe

2377
02:22:16,392 --> 02:22:18,416
a bit in the next episode

2378
02:22:18,416 --> 02:22:20,440
of code refinery so today was

2379
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:22,625
day five all about social

2380
02:22:22,625 --> 02:22:24,569
coding software licenses

2381
02:22:24,569 --> 02:22:26,673
Day six next Wednesday will

2382
02:22:26,673 --> 02:22:29,819
be about documentation and really

2383
02:22:29,819 --> 02:22:32,244
how to basically build documentations

2384
02:22:32,244 --> 02:22:34,809
and the pages actually that

2385
02:22:34,809 --> 02:22:37,414
you see with our contents

2386
02:22:37,414 --> 02:22:39,338
and exercises, they're all built

2387
02:22:39,338 --> 02:22:41,562
with a similar system.

2388
02:22:41,562 --> 02:22:42,283
So this will be more

2389
02:22:42,283 --> 02:22:43,626
practical day six where you

2390
02:22:43,626 --> 02:22:47,333
will actually have to build a documentation.

2391
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:49,557
for a software that maybe you made

2392
02:22:49,557 --> 02:22:53,283
or you will make day seven

2393
02:22:53,283 --> 02:22:55,267
will be more of introduction

2394
02:22:55,267 --> 02:23:00,716
jupyter notebooks and so for those of you

2395
02:23:00,716 --> 02:23:02,439
who maybe have never used them

2396
02:23:02,439 --> 02:23:04,903
or are not familiar with

2397
02:23:04,903 --> 02:23:06,486
all the possible tricks that you

2398
02:23:06,486 --> 02:23:07,788
can do with jupyter notebooks

2399
02:23:07,788 --> 02:23:10,152
it's definitely an interesting episode

2400
02:23:11,465 --> 02:23:13,768
Day 8 and day 9 they go

2401
02:23:13,768 --> 02:23:15,831
closer to kind of concepts

2402
02:23:15,831 --> 02:23:18,334
of research software engineering or

2403
02:23:18,334 --> 02:23:19,956
in general software engineering

2404
02:23:19,956 --> 02:23:20,937
even without research.

2405
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:24,742
And day 8 will be automated testing.

2406
02:23:24,742 --> 02:23:25,924
We kind of touched a bit

2407
02:23:25,924 --> 02:23:28,487
on this in the week 1 when

2408
02:23:28,487 --> 02:23:31,331
you were trying to push your

2409
02:23:31,331 --> 02:23:33,333
changes to somebody else's repository

2410
02:23:33,333 --> 02:23:35,376
there was a test running

2411
02:23:35,376 --> 02:23:37,298
that the ingredients were missing

2412
02:23:37,298 --> 02:23:38,600
or something like that.

2413
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:42,044
So we touched also on this

2414
02:23:42,044 --> 02:23:45,329
idea of the importance of testing also today.

2415
02:23:45,329 --> 02:23:46,790
So definitely this is the

2416
02:23:46,790 --> 02:23:48,933
type of lesson that you want

2417
02:23:48,933 --> 02:23:51,136
to join to understand how

2418
02:23:51,136 --> 02:23:52,298
you can introduce this type

2419
02:23:52,298 --> 02:23:55,001
of automated tests in your code.

2420
02:23:55,001 --> 02:23:58,325
And it integrates with GitHub.

2421
02:23:58,325 --> 02:23:59,927
So you get to use the

2422
02:23:59,927 --> 02:24:03,612
test setup on GitHub, which is very useful.

2423
02:24:04,553 --> 02:24:06,536
Exactly, because then the

2424
02:24:06,536 --> 02:24:08,359
advantage of GitHub is that

2425
02:24:08,359 --> 02:24:09,922
these tests don't need to

2426
02:24:09,922 --> 02:24:12,226
happen on your computer and if

2427
02:24:12,226 --> 02:24:16,353
someone wants to edit your GitHub

2428
02:24:16,353 --> 02:24:19,418
or suggest the testing can

2429
02:24:19,418 --> 02:24:21,081
already, you know, be

2430
02:24:21,081 --> 02:24:22,984
basically automatically performed.

2431
02:24:24,348 --> 02:24:27,012
And the last day is maybe

2432
02:24:27,012 --> 02:24:30,958
this type of more general kind

2433
02:24:30,958 --> 02:24:35,885
of type of software engineering concepts on

2434
02:24:35,885 --> 02:24:37,106
how to write good code

2435
02:24:37,106 --> 02:24:38,228
and specifically how to write

2436
02:24:38,228 --> 02:24:42,995
modular code and pure kind of functions.

2437
02:24:42,995 --> 02:24:45,158
so I hope this was

2438
02:24:45,158 --> 02:24:47,181
an interesting day although different

2439
02:24:47,181 --> 02:24:48,823
a bit different than the others

2440
02:24:48,823 --> 02:24:50,606
you can still ask us questions

2441
02:24:50,606 --> 02:24:53,730
in the in the notes document but

2442
02:24:53,730 --> 02:24:56,734
we as usual we have the

2443
02:24:58,917 --> 02:25:02,202
we have this feedback section so if you edit

2444
02:25:03,481 --> 02:25:05,624
the notes and scroll to

2445
02:25:05,624 --> 02:25:09,910
the very bottom, you can add some comments.

2446
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:11,151
So as you can see, we

2447
02:25:11,151 --> 02:25:12,493
try to change the lessons

2448
02:25:12,493 --> 02:25:15,017
so that every different run of

2449
02:25:15,017 --> 02:25:16,519
the workshop, we include new

2450
02:25:16,519 --> 02:25:18,041
materials based on your feedback.

2451
02:25:18,041 --> 02:25:19,863
So if you think that

2452
02:25:19,863 --> 02:25:21,846
something was missing and something

2453
02:25:21,846 --> 02:25:23,808
should be expanded or that there

2454
02:25:23,808 --> 02:25:25,190
was some too much of

2455
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:28,455
something, you know, please comment

2456
02:25:28,455 --> 02:25:31,699
so that we can improve for the next run.

2457
02:25:33,518 --> 02:25:34,380
All right.

2458
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:36,543
I don't think we have anything else.

2459
02:25:36,543 --> 02:25:39,929
We end up some 20 minutes earlier today.

2460
02:25:40,871 --> 02:25:43,435
Thank you, [name], for being with us today.

2461
02:25:43,435 --> 02:25:44,157
Thank you, [name].

2462
02:25:44,157 --> 02:25:46,200
And thank you, [name].

2463
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,422
Yes, thank you, [name], for

2464
02:25:47,422 --> 02:25:49,206
the broadcasting studio.

2465
02:25:51,249 --> 02:25:54,455
And thanks to the audience,

2466
02:25:54,455 --> 02:25:55,677
to the participants.

2467
02:25:55,677 --> 02:25:56,238
Exactly.

2468
02:25:56,238 --> 02:25:58,156
Thanks for showing up.

2469
02:25:58,156 --> 02:25:59,378
Thank you also for the feedback

2470
02:25:59,378 --> 02:26:01,801
that I can already see here appearing.

2471
02:26:01,801 --> 02:26:03,103
And so keep on writing.

2472
02:26:03,103 --> 02:26:04,325
And if there's other questions,

2473
02:26:05,326 --> 02:26:09,672
write them there and we can answer.

2474
02:26:11,355 --> 02:26:11,895
All right.

2475
02:26:11,895 --> 02:26:14,960
See you in seven days then.

2476
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:15,701
Bye-bye.

2477
02:26:15,701 --> 02:26:15,861
Bye-bye.
