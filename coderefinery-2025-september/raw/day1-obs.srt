1
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,149
Hello, everyone.

2
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,655
Can you hear me online?

3
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,705
Can you hear me here in the room?

4
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,489
Yes.

5
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:35,471
Good morning, [name].

6
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:36,392
How are you?

7
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,714
Good morning.

8
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,858
So I have just emailed

9
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,702
our 426 participants.

10
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,888
Hopefully, the email will soon travel.

11
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:52,376
to all the maybe more than 30 countries

12
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,239
who have registered for this

13
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,161
Code Refinery workshop.

14
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:57,144
But we still have more

15
00:09:57,144 --> 00:10:00,129
than 10 minutes before, you

16
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:04,998
know, the actual start.

17
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,220
So are you all excited?

18
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:11,024
Are you all energized, [name]?

19
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:14,292
I mean, adequately, not too much.

20
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,394
Of course, of course.

21
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:18,802
It's somewhat early in the morning.

22
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,749
Well, maybe not that early in Norway.

23
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:22,952
It's 10.50.

24
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:25,418
But what about Iceland, [name]?

25
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,157
It's about 8.50.

26
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:27,638
All right.

27
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:30,262
So it is an early morning

28
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,966
for the people in Iceland.

29
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,407
Right.

30
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,671
So let's have a look

31
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:40,038
if our participants are joining the streaming.

32
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:44,605
So I'm watching another computer right now.

33
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:47,049
Well, we still don't have

34
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,131
many people there.

35
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:50,876
I guess they are still

36
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,238
booting up their computers.

37
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,620
So

38
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,251
so I will not yet start

39
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,820
with the fun part but in

40
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,426
general I guess our volumes

41
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:06,782
are quite balanced so if our colleagues in the

42
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,441
in the Zulip have any

43
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,404
comments related to our volumes I

44
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:16,330
can say let's have a round where I say one

45
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,653
and then [name] says two and

46
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:22,158
then [name] says three and [name]

47
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,001
says four and then we can

48
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,545
continue in this module four so

49
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:34,356
one two three four one two three

50
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:41,295
or for me it's quite okay but

51
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:42,216
and i don't see anyone

52
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:46,821
commenting in the zulip right so

53
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,262
i can see people are joining

54
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:52,667
the zulip stream so i'm gonna

55
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,409
do or [name] do you know

56
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,672
how well what's what's the number

57
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,374
of the how many workshops you

58
00:11:58,374 --> 00:12:00,256
have done before this

59
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:01,297
Yeah, I think this is the

60
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:05,441
number 12, if I'm correct.

61
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,044
So it's been, it's been a

62
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,506
while, number 12 of this

63
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:13,569
large, big online workshop,

64
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,571
which practically means that every

65
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:16,892
year we do a couple.

66
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:18,574
So it's the sixth year

67
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:25,081
that we basically started 2019 and now 2025.

68
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:25,521
So yeah.

69
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,164
course there's many other

70
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,166
in-person smaller code refinery workshops

71
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,887
that have happened in the past

72
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,212
and that goes back to many

73
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:41,576
many years ago yes so i can

74
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,157
website we have a like list

75
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:48,443
of past workshops i see that uh

76
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,606
we are on the ninth year

77
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:56,703
now yeah so almost eight nights

78
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,265
and many, many workshops behind us.

79
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,490
So in this first 10 minutes,

80
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,353
we are just kind of warming up.

81
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:08,638
The listeners, the learners are

82
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:11,502
joining the streaming on Twitch TV.

83
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:15,367
But the actual workshop will

84
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:16,848
start at the o'clock.

85
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,951
This time it's very interesting

86
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,274
because we have so many time zones.

87
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:22,876
I'm so happy actually that Iceland

88
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,119
Thank you, [name], for the motivation

89
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,942
and for bringing your

90
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,245
colleagues from Iceland, because

91
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:31,047
it's three hours difference

92
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,531
compared to Helsinki, where I am right now.

93
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,994
And, you know, it's also

94
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:38,738
challenging to find a time

95
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:41,742
that suits all these time zones.

96
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:44,787
but of course time zones are

97
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,232
relative in a sense that we

98
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:50,157
have learners also register I

99
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:53,042
think the most eastern maybe was

100
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,426
India the more in the east

101
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,430
and there's also some registration

102
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,612
from South America so I

103
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:01,317
don't know whether those people are there

104
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,940
awake in the middle of

105
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,164
the night listening to us or

106
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:08,189
in India guess right now is afternoon

107
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:11,956
but hopefully everyone is as excited

108
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:15,843
as us so in this little

109
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:20,652
little how can I say ten

110
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,575
minutes that we have together

111
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:27,443
I can briefly show this notes document

112
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:29,667
that everyone should have

113
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:33,816
received via email and the idea

114
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:35,820
of this notes document is

115
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,228
that everyone can write where they're from

116
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:41,952
or test it and then

117
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:43,114
during the workshop this is

118
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,479
great for asking questions.

119
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:49,805
So in this few minutes that we have

120
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,727
before the actual workshop, feel

121
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,570
free to test the document.

122
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,193
I'm the first one here

123
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:57,755
who wrote Helsinki Sunny.

124
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,337
I put a question mark because

125
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:00,379
I'm in a room, but there's

126
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:03,242
no windows, at least in the morning.

127
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:08,689
So [name], apart from our,

128
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,372
we have some classrooms as well.

129
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:12,154
Some people are going together

130
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:12,915
in different places.

131
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,605
For example, we have a

132
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:18,733
group in Oslo as well with

133
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:23,962
I think around 12-13 people with some helpers.

134
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:25,365
So that's actually a very

135
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:27,308
exciting way to learn as well

136
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:29,633
in addition to learning one by yourself.

137
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:31,897
Yeah, it's very interesting.

138
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,019
Do you have one in Alto as well?

139
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:36,722
In Finland, basically CSC

140
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,106
is organizing, CSC, which is the

141
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,448
center for IT center for

142
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:41,490
science here in Finland.

143
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,914
It's kind of maybe 500

144
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:45,376
meters walk from here, from

145
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:47,079
Aalto University where I'm right now.

146
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,062
And so it's a nice spot

147
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:50,043
because then we can get

148
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,546
people from Aalto University

149
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,589
and Aalto University.

150
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,313
So they have the local hub.

151
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,076
What about Iceland and Reykjavik?

152
00:15:58,076 --> 00:15:59,999
Is it that also there you have a group?

153
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,521
Yeah, it's like we also have

154
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:03,864
a local room here.

155
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:04,926
We reserved for that.

156
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:07,950
And it's about 12 participants registered.

157
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:09,732
And coming back to the

158
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,695
weather, it is raining outside.

159
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,497
Luckily, I have a window.

160
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,219
Yes.

161
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,683
But unfortunately, our participants

162
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:19,405
are in a closed room.

163
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,430
And of course, I mean, we understand

164
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,234
that some people are alone

165
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,439
in their office or bedroom

166
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:29,363
watching the stream and learning with us.

167
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,425
And some people are together

168
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,066
with other people.

169
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,089
In the end, we all be

170
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,572
watching kind of TV together.

171
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,335
But this is the advantage

172
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,477
of this notes document that

173
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:40,803
we can actually interact with the TV hosts.

174
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:43,588
so i can already see

175
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:49,277
that people are writing also we have Carlsruhe,

176
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,701
Prague, Belgrade so yeah we

177
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:55,487
are covering a nice a nice

178
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:59,033
set of european countries so

179
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:03,905
there's still three minutes to go and

180
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:05,167
I mentioned in the email

181
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,509
that everyone had just received

182
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:08,271
that there is also a Zoom room.

183
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:12,237
Now, the idea of the Zoom is that

184
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:13,459
if you need help during

185
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,602
exercises, you can join that room

186
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,544
and there are some helpers

187
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,346
there, but it's not something

188
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:23,254
that you actually need for learning.

189
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,216
In the end, this notes document

190
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:27,981
that I'm showing right now is the best

191
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,624
for interacting with the

192
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:31,986
instructors, interacting with the

193
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,048
helpers and so on.

194
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,452
there's many of us watching

195
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:37,680
it behind the scenes so i

196
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,482
guess you will give some

197
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,648
more instructions on how to write

198
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:44,037
on it exactly that will be part of the intro

199
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,271
Right.

200
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:47,293
There's another icebreaker here

201
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,596
at the bottom.

202
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:49,919
Have you ever wished you had

203
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,543
a code time machine?

204
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:52,906
So maybe I'm going to ask [name].

205
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:54,791
Have you ever wished you had

206
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,652
the code time machine?

207
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:58,459
Or maybe you have a code time machine?

208
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,423
Yeah, in fact, I have.

209
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:01,225
I'm going to show it today.

210
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,262
What about you, [name]?

211
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,503
yeah i had the same thing

212
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,185
like uh mostly using the

213
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:11,690
same time machine everyone like i suppose

214
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:15,574
so it's good too that is for some

215
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:16,916
for certain things we can

216
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:22,923
build time machines so now

217
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:25,386
the time machine the the issue

218
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:26,808
with my machine is only for the

219
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:27,949
past i can't go off to the

220
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:31,253
future yet but it's coming

221
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:35,097
that's interesting is it that

222
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:37,200
some large language model will

223
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:41,986
predict your next whatever year of code

224
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:45,050
so that you know well let's

225
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,454
not go there maybe all right

226
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:50,897
what else do we have yeah

227
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,457
i'm gonna start by showing the yeah go ahead

228
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,859
So I'd just like to say

229
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:57,063
hello to our Oslo instructors,

230
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:59,046
[name], [name], and [name].

231
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,949
Hi, I'll meet you tomorrow.

232
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:02,211
Today I have to be away

233
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:04,014
from the room because it's

234
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:06,197
difficult to teach in the class itself.

235
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,085
And all the classrooms, hello as well.

236
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:12,908
Make sure your projector is

237
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:15,271
set up and people can hear us properly.

238
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,356
And also the screen font

239
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,680
is large enough for them to read.

240
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,562
That's a very good point

241
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,704
about the screen phone, because

242
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,330
Twitch TV being a broadcast,

243
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,835
sometimes they try to save

244
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,380
the bandwidth, save the bits.

245
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,462
And so you really need to

246
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:37,132
set the quality of the Twitch TV stream

247
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,655
so that it's not trying

248
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,718
to compress everything and

249
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:42,243
make everything pixelated.

250
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:44,365
and so for those at home

251
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:45,946
and for those in these rooms

252
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:49,630
please set the twitch tv quality to source

253
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,211
so that you you get all

254
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,995
the pixels from our from our workshop

255
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:01,881
so that's 10 seconds before

256
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:05,685
finish 12 o'clock ice line

257
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:09,128
the nine o'clock and so i think we can start

258
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,572
Hello everyone and welcome to

259
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:14,794
yet another Code Refinery

260
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:17,199
workshop, September-October 2025.

261
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,745
We have a format that

262
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,007
is slightly different when it

263
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,210
comes to the schedule compared

264
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,434
to previous workshops, so if this

265
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,157
is not the first Code Refinery workshop

266
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:28,178
that you follow, you will

267
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,721
find some interesting changes,

268
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:31,805
more exercises basically.

269
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,427
what I'm showing right now

270
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,211
on the twitch.tv stream is

271
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:39,295
the main workshop web page which

272
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
is our kind of communication channel

273
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,700
so that here you can

274
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,402
follow the schedule you get all

275
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:46,545
the links to the materials and

276
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,268
you will also get access to

277
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:52,634
the questions and answer document

278
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,957
that we will soon introduce

279
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,142
so right now we are at

280
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,547
day one i'm scrolling down to day one

281
00:20:59,547 --> 00:21:03,857
and i'm gonna talk about this welcome

282
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:05,561
and introduction to the workshop

283
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,904
so when i click the link

284
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:08,989
that is there it will actually

285
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:12,156
go to the presentation material

286
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:13,098
that we will use

287
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,681
so we will not use

288
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:18,147
any powerpoints here they're all materials

289
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:21,332
and they're all hosted in github

290
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:22,234
so that if you find a

291
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:25,079
typo you will learn how to

292
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,963
submit an amendment all right but

293
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:28,725
we are glad that you are

294
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:32,531
here briefly about code refinery

295
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,935
so code refinery is an ordi

296
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:36,598
project focused on teaching

297
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,782
scientific computing tools

298
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:40,364
But Code Refinery is especially

299
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:41,686
a large community of

300
00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:44,770
research software engineers, researchers

301
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,073
who need to work with computers

302
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,655
and code and data and

303
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:51,119
in general enthusiasts about

304
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,942
research software and anything that

305
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:54,824
is related to that.

306
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,267
But Code Refinery is also

307
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:58,829
this workshop where we are.

308
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,833
here right now and lots of lessons

309
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,718
and open learning materials that

310
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,103
some of them are covered in this workshop

311
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:09,565
but we also have other

312
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:10,847
learning materials that go beyond

313
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:12,289
for more advanced topic

314
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:15,253
there's many founders and

315
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:16,876
organizations that are involved

316
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,438
in code refinery

317
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,500
The main funder is

318
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,503
the Nordic E-Infrastructure Collaboration

319
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:24,045
and the partners are

320
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:26,428
Aalto University, where I'm from,

321
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,551
CSC, IT Centre for Science, also in Finland.

322
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,614
Then we have from Denmark the Centre

323
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:32,875
for Humanities Computing and

324
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,838
the Danish E-Infrastructure Cooperation.

325
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:41,366
Sweden is there with the EuroCC, ENCCS

326
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,468
and also the National

327
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:45,691
Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing.

328
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,754
And then we have Norway

329
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,417
with the University of Oslo, where

330
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,443
one of our first instructors is from.

331
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:54,845
And then RIS Sigma 2

332
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:56,368
and University of Iceland, where

333
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:59,693
our second instructor of the day is also from.

334
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,095
So I'm already going to say hi.

335
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:04,761
You might see their faces here to [name].

336
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:05,803
Hi, hello.

337
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:06,243
Good morning.

338
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:07,525
Yeah, hi.

339
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:08,226
Good morning.

340
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:08,894
Good morning.

341
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:10,940
I will introduce you properly, don't worry.

342
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,166
So with all your expertise and titles.

343
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:16,275
But briefly to motivate a little bit,

344
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:18,882
there's this nice image by

345
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:21,730
[name] that kind of tries

346
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,896
to give you the

347
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,920
what are the six useful steps

348
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,982
or helpful steps for

349
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,187
making reproducible research.

350
00:23:29,187 --> 00:23:30,169
I'm not now going to

351
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,011
start talking about

352
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,255
reproducibility, reproducibility crisis

353
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:34,698
because I don't want to spoil the fun.

354
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:36,081
That is for next week and

355
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,023
you will hear all about

356
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:39,488
reproducibility issues in science.

357
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:42,655
But in general, all the bits

358
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:43,677
that you will learn throughout

359
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:46,022
the workshop are related to what you see here.

360
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:47,986
So getting your project folders

361
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:50,011
and files in order, making sure

362
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,813
that you can travel in

363
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:53,058
time, specifically that you can

364
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,461
travel back in time.

365
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,427
Travel in the future, it's still not there.

366
00:23:57,427 --> 00:24:01,552
and in general so make your research

367
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:04,716
that is transparent in a

368
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:06,899
way that other people can look

369
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,821
at your code maybe look at your data

370
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,084
if possible and look at

371
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,907
your documentation so that you

372
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:16,130
are able to open your software

373
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,955
or open your data and follow the best practices

374
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:22,078
Sometimes we don't really like

375
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,740
the term best practices.

376
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,902
It's much more inclusive to

377
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,524
say good enough practices,

378
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:27,686
because sometimes the good enough

379
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:31,491
practices is truly what really matters.

380
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:34,175
So how does this workshop works?

381
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,718
Well, the format, as you

382
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:38,502
are seeing, it happens on Twitch TV.

383
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:41,446
And the reason is, well,

384
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,647
you know, most likely you've been

385
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,430
to some Zoom teaching with

386
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,672
hundreds of people there.

387
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:46,533
It's not very...

388
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:51,158
It can be stressful to

389
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:54,482
keep people microphone off and so on.

390
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:56,605
Here it's more like a TV show.

391
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:59,007
We are here in a small studio

392
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:00,870
and we are broadcasting to

393
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,652
anyone in the planet who wants

394
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:05,134
to hear about reproducible research.

395
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,859
And by doing this also, it's

396
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:11,422
easier to take care of the recordings,

397
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:12,303
that the recordings will

398
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,225
be immediately available on Twitch TV.

399
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:16,831
And later, after we basically

400
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,576
cut them and subtitle them, they

401
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:19,618
will be also on YouTube.

402
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:22,365
The attendance is kind of

403
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:23,788
choose your own adventure.

404
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,392
There are the first part,

405
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:26,535
which is happened this week.

406
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:28,279
It's all about version control

407
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,066
and Git with GitHub.

408
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:33,050
but then after that we

409
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,793
have different episodes happening

410
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:38,941
multiple weeks and come join the topics

411
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,363
that you find more useful

412
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:42,287
could it be reproducible research

413
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,431
could it be software licenses

414
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:46,735
could it be whatever you need

415
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:48,238
or follow them all we

416
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:50,221
don't really track attendance and

417
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:51,364
you can watch them live or

418
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:52,666
you can watch them later

419
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,690
materials are always available

420
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,214
they are linked in the workshop schedule

421
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:59,698
as I showed earlier and when

422
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:01,722
it comes to the actual schedule

423
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:04,487
we try to have at least a

424
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:06,650
10 minutes break every hour and

425
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,853
for this first part in the

426
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:09,035
first week we will have a one

427
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,958
hour break in the middle

428
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:14,203
so in when it comes to time zones

429
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:15,184
because we try to fit

430
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:16,867
multiple time zones this will

431
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,010
be a convenient break for maybe

432
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,534
people in UK and Iceland and

433
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:24,539
for the Oslo and Finland it would

434
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,263
be more like a afternoon coffee break

435
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,084
then i briefly mentioned

436
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:33,169
about this collaborative notes document

437
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:35,552
that i was showing earlier and

438
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,654
the idea of the collaborative

439
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:39,037
notes document is that it's

440
00:26:39,037 --> 00:26:40,940
somewhat like a google docs

441
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,404
so that everyone can edit at the same time

442
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:45,126
and this is much more

443
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:48,051
convenient than using a chat

444
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,793
for example the zoom chat that

445
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:50,935
i was mentioning earlier

446
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:52,537
because here the questions

447
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:55,860
are basically forming a nice

448
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,203
documented set of questions and answers.

449
00:26:59,184 --> 00:26:59,985
What is really interesting

450
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,446
that sometimes it's not just

451
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:03,328
the experts or the helpers that

452
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:04,129
are going to answer.

453
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:05,951
Sometimes you might know the answer.

454
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,833
You might have experienced the same bug,

455
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,174
the same issue with some

456
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:11,016
operating system and you can

457
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:11,977
share your experience.

458
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,059
So it's truly a

459
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:16,022
collaborative document where we can

460
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:18,104
all edit at the same time.

461
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,848
To edit the document, if you

462
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,932
open the page that you received

463
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,057
in your email, there is a

464
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:27,544
pencil in the top right corner.

465
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:28,346
So if you click on the

466
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,292
pencil, the view mode will change

467
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,817
from view to edit.

468
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,561
So I will briefly show it.

469
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,603
Now I have another window

470
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:37,966
here with the notes document.

471
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:41,210
I scroll up I see this

472
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,112
pencil I click the pencil and

473
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,535
now I'm in this edit mode and

474
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:46,737
I can see here there's

475
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:49,520
already 93 people watching this

476
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,084
page maybe editing this page and

477
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,645
many of you everything here

478
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:55,588
where you're from is it sunny

479
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:57,390
is it not sunny it's a

480
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,355
nice data set of locations and weather

481
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:04,559
and this is how we

482
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,804
run sometimes polls where basically

483
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,588
you can add in this case an

484
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,472
O to say you know if you wished to get them

485
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:15,515
and here you can already

486
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:17,878
start asking questions and you see

487
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:19,340
we use with this indentation

488
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,005
we have nice colors and different questions

489
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:23,866
Maybe the only thing that

490
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:25,348
it's important that you always write

491
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:27,251
on top of the last line so

492
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:29,674
that it's easier to know when is

493
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,677
the end of the document.

494
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:32,578
And if you feel that

495
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:33,700
the document is getting very

496
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,965
slow, then it's good to, you

497
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,348
know, we have a good server

498
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:40,930
that hosts this document.

499
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,472
But sometimes if I would say

500
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,534
if the number goes above

501
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:46,578
150 simultaneous edits, it starts

502
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:47,359
to get difficult.

503
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,501
So then it's good to click

504
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,123
on this eye icon.

505
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:53,868
in the very top part of

506
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:55,870
the screen and so that it goes

507
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,734
back to this view mode.

508
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,338
All right, back to the introduction.

509
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:06,624
Try to please don't put

510
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:10,048
personal data or passwords into

511
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,831
this share not documents.

512
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:12,451
At the end of the day,

513
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,334
we will archive it so that

514
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,916
after the whole workshop, we have

515
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,300
a nice set of question.

516
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,608
very briefly about the practical setup

517
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:24,669
so you might have noticed

518
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:27,254
that this screen share streaming

519
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:28,236
that we are doing right now

520
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:31,101
is not the usual landscape whole

521
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:33,284
screen type of setup but we

522
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,869
have this vertical stream and the

523
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:37,392
idea of the vertical stream share

524
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:40,016
is that it really helps those

525
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:41,398
who have a single monitor

526
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:42,841
for example laptop users

527
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:44,323
because then you can keep

528
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:46,627
the twitch tv open in let's

529
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:47,709
say like you show here on the

530
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,492
left hand side of the screen

531
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:50,474
and then you have all the

532
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:52,557
right hand side free where you can put

533
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,400
for example the web browser

534
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,227
with the with the lessons with the materials

535
00:29:58,227 --> 00:30:00,230
or your terminal if you

536
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,712
are learning it with the terminal

537
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,916
or vs code or any other

538
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,280
window that you might need

539
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,966
so this is very useful if

540
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:09,652
you have a single screen of course those

541
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:10,856
who have multiple screens they

542
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:13,405
can arrange the windows as they prefer

543
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:17,276
All right, I'm soon done

544
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,839
with all these intros.

545
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,342
I promise you I will.

546
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:21,984
This is the only day where

547
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:24,629
we do this long intro, but

548
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,572
I'm just very happy that there's

549
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:28,976
so many people involved in this workshop.

550
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:31,821
Again, we have now here it says 370,

551
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,584
which was the number from a few days ago,

552
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:34,746
but this morning it was

553
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:39,033
426 people registered from really

554
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,435
all over the world.

555
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:42,619
and behind the scenes

556
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,863
there's 15 coordinators and

557
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:47,447
helpers, instructors, facilitators.

558
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:49,751
It's a big work but we

559
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:52,035
hope that there is value in

560
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:55,842
all this energy that we put into this.

561
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:58,244
briefly on the workshop etiquette

562
00:30:58,244 --> 00:30:59,626
as usual we try to be

563
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:01,368
nice to each other and you

564
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:02,509
have to understand that we

565
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:04,411
are very different some people

566
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:06,613
might be experienced coders who

567
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:07,454
have coded all their life

568
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:09,656
some people might have just started

569
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:10,937
or maybe not even will

570
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,519
never code they're just here to

571
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,900
learn the tools that their

572
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,022
coding colleagues are using so

573
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:17,904
let's just respect everybody else's

574
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:20,907
space and differences let's try

575
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:23,450
to be helpful in the collaborative document

576
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,434
And if something is not right,

577
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:28,920
if you feel that something is wrong,

578
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,243
we have a code of conduct

579
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:31,365
and you can get in touch

580
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,348
with the workshop organizer, Samantha

581
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:34,851
and I, or with the

582
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:39,785
general support at coderefinery.org address.

583
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:41,787
final notes well most of

584
00:31:41,787 --> 00:31:43,629
you are registered if you register

585
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:46,713
you will get more emails from me reminders

586
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:51,118
and links and anything helpful

587
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,079
but of course you can also

588
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,722
just watch the the twitch tv stream

589
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:57,665
and and don't worry about it for those

590
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,147
who need certificates there's

591
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:00,909
a clear instructions there if

592
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:02,671
they're not clear please ask

593
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,813
in the notes document

594
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:07,050
And finally, Code Refinery is

595
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,871
an open project.

596
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,573
Anyone can join us.

597
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:10,535
If you follow the link

598
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:12,878
here, there are multiple ways to join us,

599
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:14,861
whether you like to receive emails

600
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:16,343
once in a while, not too

601
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:18,866
many, don't worry, or maybe

602
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:20,068
you want to actively join us.

603
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:22,912
For example, we host a Zulip channel

604
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:25,535
where many, many, many researchers

605
00:32:25,535 --> 00:32:29,160
and software engineers and HPC admins,

606
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,323
they're all there and

607
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,346
answering each other's questions, sharing.

608
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:35,168
interesting links and sometimes

609
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,049
also funny memes.

610
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:40,315
But I think I've talked enough.

611
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:42,838
So maybe I'm going to ask [name].

612
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,440
Hello, [name].

613
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:47,363
[name] is here with us today

614
00:32:47,363 --> 00:32:48,445
and he will be with us for

615
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:51,989
many days as the broadcasting

616
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:53,871
expert or broadcaster.

617
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,715
Is that broadcaster?

618
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:59,278
Broadcaster is good.

619
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,561
Expert is saying so much.

620
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:03,884
Well, as I was explaining earlier,

621
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:05,245
if you look at the distribution

622
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:06,547
of all the broadcasters in the

623
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:07,688
world, you are falling in

624
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,911
a quite high percentile.

625
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:11,172
But I'm asking you if you

626
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,814
can switch to the notes document

627
00:33:13,956 --> 00:33:14,857
so that we can have a

628
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:16,239
look if there's already any.

629
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:20,223
This is the wrong one.

630
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:21,885
So sorry.

631
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:22,246
Okay.

632
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,007
Yes, this is.

633
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:24,248
Yes.

634
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,418
Okay.

635
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:30,750
so that we can have a look at

636
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,339
if there's anything relevant

637
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:35,703
in the questions and in the

638
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:39,092
meantime our first speaker or

639
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:43,057
our instructor can set up their screen share.

640
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:46,482
[name], there is one question.

641
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,084
Someone says that they are

642
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:48,785
not going through the

643
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:51,028
installation session because we see

644
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,931
that some people are very new.

645
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,514
That's a good question.

646
00:33:55,514 --> 00:33:58,899
In our installation pages, there

647
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:01,142
is this minimum required installation,

648
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:03,526
which is just the fact if

649
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:06,610
you have a GitHub account, that's enough.

650
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,312
You can do the exercises

651
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,677
only using the GitHub web pages and

652
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,560
so you know you don't need

653
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,042
to worry i would say that

654
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:17,606
the more heavier part of the installation

655
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:18,667
which is the setting up

656
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,352
of a conda environment it's more needed

657
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:24,376
for from next week so for the part two

658
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:25,578
but for today and for the

659
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,581
next days having a github account

660
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:29,364
is all you need if you want

661
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:30,846
to of course not just use

662
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:33,330
the github website to work with

663
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,471
git because you want to do

664
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,314
vs code or the terminal

665
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:38,317
then you know if you didn't

666
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,358
have time to do it today you

667
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:41,161
can do it later in the afternoon and

668
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,244
if you need help we can set

669
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,146
up some ad hoc installations

670
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:51,495
sessions all right so I guess

671
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:52,677
[name] you want to set up

672
00:34:52,677 --> 00:35:00,428
your screen share if there's

673
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:01,950
any other relevant questions

674
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,347
At least by quickly having a

675
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:06,289
look, I don't see.

676
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:09,312
Sorry, I have started sharing my screen.

677
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,436
And also, [name], if they have

678
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:14,279
not done the installation session,

679
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,700
I would recommend that in

680
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,284
the morning they don't try to install things.

681
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,947
Maybe apply for a GitHub account

682
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:23,650
and just follow because they

683
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,912
don't need the rest of

684
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:27,095
installation for the rest of the day.

685
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:29,778
But maybe later today they

686
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:30,619
could attend to it.

687
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:32,930
Sounds good, [name]?

688
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,731
That's very good.

689
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,715
And if you register, you

690
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:36,717
receive this email.

691
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,759
There's a Zoom link there.

692
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:40,143
So for example, during the break, you can,

693
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,385
if you need help, we are

694
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:43,990
most likely in that Zoom trying to help you.

695
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:46,114
All right.

696
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:48,819
But I see that [name]

697
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,602
started the screen share.

698
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:53,206
So we can actually start.

699
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:54,028
So Jana, do you want

700
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,731
to show [name]'s screen?

701
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:58,294
and now i'm going to

702
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,638
introduce the first day of

703
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:02,802
code refinery with the topic

704
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:05,807
of introduction to git version control

705
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:08,952
and with us today we have

706
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:13,079
um so we have [name]

707
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,483
who is chief engineer at the

708
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:16,845
university of oslo is an

709
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:18,288
expert in high performance

710
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,513
computing working with the nris sigma 2

711
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,616
cluster and with [name] from

712
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:28,423
Oslo we also have [name],

713
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:30,225
I hope I pronounced it well,

714
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:33,310
who is professor at the University of Iceland.

715
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,471
He's an expert of quantum

716
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:36,434
simulations and HPC as well.

717
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:39,919
So I'm very happy to have

718
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,061
both of you here today.

719
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:45,447
It talked enough so the floor is yours

720
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:48,091
and let's learn some git

721
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,116
virtual control together.

722
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:51,499
Thanks, [name].

723
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,182
Thank you, [name].

724
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:54,304
Thank you, [name].

725
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:55,566
And I would like to, in

726
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,149
advance, I would like to thank

727
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,492
all the effort from the

728
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:00,476
helpers, our fellow colleagues

729
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:02,039
from Ford Refinery, the video

730
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,343
directors and everybody for the

731
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,628
hard work, upcoming hard work.

732
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,710
So we can thank them later

733
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,431
on today as well.

734
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:10,114
So how are you, [name]?

735
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:12,070
Are you ready for some git?

736
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,892
Yeah, yeah, I'm really excited.

737
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:14,893
This is the first time I

738
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:18,036
was doing, but yeah, I'm really into it.

739
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:21,560
It's nice to do this with you, this lesson.

740
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,684
And [name] quite kindly introduced

741
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:27,246
us as like experts of HPC, etc.

742
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,828
But today we are going to

743
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:31,051
come to you as fellow learners.

744
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:32,552
You know, we use Git and

745
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:33,393
we would like to share

746
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:36,016
some experience that might be useful for you.

747
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:38,782
So we kind of portray

748
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:41,648
as mutual learning experience rather

749
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:42,931
than like we teach and you

750
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,436
have to study everything and go for exam.

751
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:49,384
But it's just try to get something from us.

752
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,534
The first part of the lesson is

753
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:54,836
that we're going to have

754
00:37:54,836 --> 00:37:57,099
some motivation about Git, why

755
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:01,366
we sort of selected this technology

756
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,970
and why we are going to talk about it.

757
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,372
After that, [name] would come

758
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:08,497
with the basic part of the

759
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,680
browsing, and then we'll go for a break.

760
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,606
And then the next part would start.

761
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:17,731
So I will start with the motivation.

762
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,353
and the human the material

763
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:20,794
i'm following is already there

764
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:24,838
in the internet okay yeah yeah

765
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,519
could could you point out where

766
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,522
i can find it so yes so uh you could uh

767
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:31,224
so the the easiest way to

768
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:33,386
find out is uh from if you

769
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:34,587
got an email from with

770
00:38:34,587 --> 00:38:35,748
the shared document there's a

771
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:37,490
link in this document but that

772
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,010
is only for the

773
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,232
registered participants otherwise if

774
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:41,814
you really really get lost you

775
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:44,076
could go to code refinery

776
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,304
And you could go for

777
00:38:49,304 --> 00:38:54,660
workshops or events and upcoming events here.

778
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,415
And then code refinery workshops online.

779
00:38:59,415 --> 00:38:59,736
Okay.

780
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:02,266
And then I recommend that

781
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:04,569
we bookmark this so we can come back to this.

782
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,851
So this is the place where I am.

783
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:07,692
And I'm only going to

784
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:09,173
show things already here.

785
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:12,457
I'm not going to show anything extra.

786
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:15,600
But if I type, if I had to type,

787
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,041
for example, when answering a question

788
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,202
that something extra, we have

789
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:19,463
to transfer it to the

790
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:22,927
shared document so people will not get lost.

791
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,207
Okay.

792
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:25,109
Sounds good.

793
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,489
Sounds good?

794
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:26,630
Yep.

795
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,871
Yes.

796
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:29,233
So then let's go for the motivation part.

797
00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:33,751
So, the motivation for using Git

798
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:37,198
is to keep track of changes.

799
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,844
So, the Indrika was talking

800
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,685
about this time machine.

801
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,351
So, this is a code time machine.

802
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:47,239
When you develop code, you

803
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,978
can keep snapshots of different stages.

804
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:54,444
and go back to a past stage

805
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:58,635
if you need, if you keep track of this.

806
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,307
For this, do you use Git as well, [name]?

807
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:05,894
And could you briefly mention

808
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:07,250
how you use it?

809
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,133
Yeah, actually, I mostly use

810
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,557
the Git for writing some codes.

811
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:13,781
You know, it's like, for suppose,

812
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,064
if I want to add,

813
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:18,890
contribute to some existing code,

814
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,032
so I just clone the

815
00:40:20,032 --> 00:40:22,296
code, take the repository and

816
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:25,041
add some features, maybe test it

817
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,365
and then like try to push it back.

818
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:29,068
So, this is all, like, I

819
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:30,391
would like to contribute.

820
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:33,798
Basically, it's, like, and sometimes

821
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,283
if I also want to, like,

822
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:38,949
keep track of some documents, so

823
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:41,414
I also use it for keeping track of that.

824
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:42,556
Okay.

825
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:43,598
How about you, like...

826
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:44,159
Yeah.

827
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,302
So I also, when I'm developing a code,

828
00:40:46,302 --> 00:40:49,546
instead of keeping copies of folders,

829
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:52,249
for example, the code in

830
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,113
May, code in April, code in June, you know,

831
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,155
some sort of my own

832
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:58,758
version control system, I use Git

833
00:40:58,758 --> 00:40:59,880
so I can keep track and I

834
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,802
can also work with collaborators.

835
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,504
So different people can work

836
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,167
on the same code base without

837
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:06,809
stepping on each other's toes

838
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,751
and then combine the work.

839
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:09,232
So we can

840
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:11,615
We'll talk about all those things.

841
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:13,237
First thing I will show

842
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,999
is this example repository to

843
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:18,163
show this snapshot feature.

844
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:22,448
So the snapshot feature is that Git,

845
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:24,530
by the way, I start

846
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,232
using version control with

847
00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:27,414
something called subversion.

848
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:28,855
So Git is not the

849
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:32,139
only version control system that's around,

850
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,241
but it's the most popular

851
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,944
and most convenient and most integrated one.

852
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:37,666
So that's why we are talking.

853
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:41,032
um and now this code is hosted on github

854
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:43,958
so code refinery we are

855
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,961
not promoting github as as a company

856
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:47,885
so we are showing github

857
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,307
because it's the most popular

858
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,832
and there's high chance that

859
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,515
you'll interact with github than

860
00:41:53,515 --> 00:41:58,024
any other services in my personal

861
00:41:58,024 --> 00:42:00,717
life i use more gitlab

862
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:05,301
because we have hosted our own GitLab.

863
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,362
But here we are showing

864
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:07,923
this because this is the

865
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:10,325
most likely interface that you

866
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:12,287
will interact with.

867
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:15,169
So here, [name], this is a

868
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:19,113
history of a single file here, run.py.

869
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:21,555
And if I scroll slowly

870
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:25,018
downwards to see where it was first created.

871
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,640
So this was created in 2016

872
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,738
by a person called Bast.

873
00:42:30,738 --> 00:42:32,820
And then there is some

874
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,024
identifier for that version.

875
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,406
And then there are some links here.

876
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,489
So first thing I want to

877
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:43,932
mention here is that this

878
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:48,376
detail about this file is

879
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:51,459
in context with everything else around it.

880
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:54,022
So this is not just this

881
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:56,424
snapshot of that file, but a

882
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:59,007
snapshot of the entire code base

883
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,796
The time this was, we call

884
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,979
in Git, we call it the commit was made.

885
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,081
That's interesting.

886
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:07,582
Yes.

887
00:43:07,582 --> 00:43:09,625
So do you know why, I

888
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,068
mean, there is this cryptic

889
00:43:12,068 --> 00:43:14,250
identifier, FF48 something.

890
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:16,934
Do you know why it is

891
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:18,936
like not numbers, like integers,

892
00:43:18,936 --> 00:43:20,118
like one, two, three?

893
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:21,820
Do you see the advantage of this?

894
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,141
Or do you know why this,

895
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:24,523
because we'll see this, we'll be

896
00:43:24,523 --> 00:43:25,264
seeing this a lot.

897
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:28,486
Yeah, I think it's a

898
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:32,332
unique identifier or something like that.

899
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:32,572
Yes.

900
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:35,977
That's a unique generated identifier.

901
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:37,740
This also comes with the fact

902
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,302
that Git is a distributed

903
00:43:39,302 --> 00:43:41,805
version control system that we'll

904
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:43,848
mention a little later in this lesson,

905
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:45,310
which means that if you

906
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,933
modify the same file in

907
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:48,475
the same repository, you'll get

908
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:50,518
a unique identifier yourself.

909
00:43:50,518 --> 00:43:51,659
And if I do it, I'll

910
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:53,442
get a different identifier.

911
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:54,804
which makes it easier to

912
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,866
combine things later because Git

913
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:58,848
would know unambiguously how to

914
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:00,290
do the combination.

915
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,212
And also this identifier would say

916
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,634
that which copy was used

917
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:06,036
before the identification.

918
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:06,917
We call it the parent.

919
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,780
So all this information are

920
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,043
put together through an algorithm

921
00:44:12,043 --> 00:44:13,144
and this is a generator.

922
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:16,147
So it's a generated uniform identifier.

923
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:19,551
And then if I click that here,

924
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,117
I go to a page.

925
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:24,580
Where should I click?

926
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,944
So I clicked on the hash.

927
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:30,131
So I will show you again.

928
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:33,678
So here, you see this identify here?

929
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:34,379
Yeah, I see that.

930
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:36,764
By clicking it, I can

931
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:40,391
get more details about that snapshot.

932
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:40,962
Okay.

933
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:43,165
So as you can see, there are three files.

934
00:44:43,165 --> 00:44:45,528
So this init file, the runpy,

935
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:47,331
and then there's another file,

936
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:49,513
which is ugly.py.

937
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:51,556
So this is a snapshot of

938
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,480
the three changes in one snapshot.

939
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,022
And this is the first

940
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:58,145
commit in GitSense data, the

941
00:44:58,145 --> 00:44:59,847
first recorded history that this

942
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,750
file was introduced to this repository.

943
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:07,709
So we get that information by this hash.

944
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:10,774
So this is the sort of advantage for,

945
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,637
let's say, if I want to,

946
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:15,721
if I do some change here,

947
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:17,624
like in 2022, they have done

948
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:19,868
some change and something broke.

949
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,213
Let's say a test fails.

950
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:23,960
Okay.

951
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,562
Then what we can do is we

952
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:28,526
can go to the previous version.

953
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:31,129
Here it says view code at this point.

954
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,372
So when I click that, it will

955
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:34,533
not go to the code itself,

956
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:36,816
but the snapshot of the

957
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:38,198
repository, all the files.

958
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:42,343
So if I click that, then I

959
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:46,328
go to the file at that point,

960
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:47,790
and I could run this file.

961
00:45:48,935 --> 00:45:52,380
and see not only the

962
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,623
snapshot would include not only that file,

963
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:57,187
but the other files as well,

964
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,889
if there's a change and we

965
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,833
could run this and see whether test passes.

966
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:05,258
Would that make sense?

967
00:46:05,258 --> 00:46:06,340
So could you explain, do

968
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,061
you want to explain a little

969
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:09,100
bit more what I said a little bit?

970
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,405
yeah basically i think uh

971
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:14,731
you are uh looking at this run.py

972
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,936
and just uh looking at

973
00:46:16,936 --> 00:46:18,539
the timestamps basically it's like

974
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:20,442
when it is created when

975
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:22,847
someone modified it a bit and

976
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:25,052
then when you try to like uh

977
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:27,456
push it back there are like uh

978
00:46:27,456 --> 00:46:29,789
some checks to be done like a

979
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:30,871
Yes.

980
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,414
So if something breaks, you can

981
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,197
go back and test it.

982
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,005
And then also you could take

983
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:38,846
only parts of it.

984
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:41,932
In the first, the example

985
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:42,593
I showed that there were

986
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:45,299
three files here modified.

987
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,930
You could take parts that were like

988
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,436
replace the broken parts, for example.

989
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:52,901
So basically you can time travel back.

990
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:53,202
Yes.

991
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:54,324
Okay.

992
00:46:54,324 --> 00:46:56,228
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:46:56,228 --> 00:46:57,872
So here, today we'll be

994
00:46:57,872 --> 00:46:59,476
working on the browser.

995
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:00,558
So the web browser, all you

996
00:47:00,558 --> 00:47:02,783
need is a web browser and a GitHub account.

997
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,184
But normally, if you use a

998
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:11,909
lot of coding, you would not

999
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:14,092
follow a workflow like this.

1000
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:15,934
But for example, I use

1001
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,899
the terminal for this kind of work.

1002
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:21,181
And most people, they

1003
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:24,525
use integrated development environment,

1004
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,557
VS Code and et cetera.

1005
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:28,381
But the reason that we are

1006
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:31,669
showing today on the browser is

1007
00:47:31,669 --> 00:47:33,914
that on the first day, we

1008
00:47:33,914 --> 00:47:35,858
would like everybody to get

1009
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:37,883
on board, even people who has never

1010
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,542
seen Git before.

1011
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:42,805
So we minimize the amount

1012
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:44,087
of things like terminal.

1013
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:45,489
If people are very much

1014
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:46,811
used to Windows environments, they

1015
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,134
might not be very familiar with the terminal.

1016
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:50,957
So we remove all the extra

1017
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:52,700
stuff that you need to know

1018
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,382
in order to understand Git.

1019
00:47:54,382 --> 00:47:55,804
And we narrow down only

1020
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:57,226
on the Git concepts.

1021
00:47:57,226 --> 00:48:00,210
And we'll talk today, you and me, all day.

1022
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:02,854
And try to understand that concept.

1023
00:48:02,854 --> 00:48:04,076
And then in the next

1024
00:48:04,076 --> 00:48:07,293
days, the concepts will be transferable.

1025
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:08,616
So this is an example.

1026
00:48:08,616 --> 00:48:09,759
So this is how it would

1027
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:11,683
look like on a terminal.

1028
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:12,926
So there's a commit with

1029
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:16,213
a hash, the author, the author's email,

1030
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:17,777
and the date, and a short

1031
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:20,623
log message of what has happened.

1032
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:21,746
So [name], what is the

1033
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:23,189
difference between this one and

1034
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:25,771
the one you showed before, like the

1035
00:48:25,771 --> 00:48:26,392
Yes.

1036
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:28,816
So this is the one, as we

1037
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:30,899
see it on the web browser, on the internet.

1038
00:48:30,899 --> 00:48:32,441
So this is the, we can

1039
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:35,246
call it the cloud, GitHub cloud.

1040
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,868
And you can also do it

1041
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:38,411
on your local computer, on your terminal.

1042
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:39,953
You can download it on

1043
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:43,218
your terminal and then look at it.

1044
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:46,503
So we used, tomorrow we'll

1045
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:49,109
use terms like pool, push,

1046
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:50,611
Um, so this being, this

1047
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:53,576
is like uploading and downloading,

1048
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:55,779
but in Git, when you do this pool push,

1049
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,001
the difference between upload

1050
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,483
download is that it will

1051
00:48:58,483 --> 00:49:00,766
only download or upload the differences.

1052
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:02,008
It will not download, upload

1053
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:03,450
the entire thing back and forth.

1054
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:07,236
Uh, so this terminal, we have pulled it,

1055
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,239
you know, you mean, uh, I mean, um,

1056
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,202
it, uh, download it to a computer

1057
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:12,263
and we can have a look

1058
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:13,465
at it and, but you'll, you'll

1059
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:15,528
see the same concepts here as well.

1060
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:18,590
Um,

1061
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,613
We already talked much about, you know,

1062
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:24,499
why we kind of need track to keep track,

1063
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:26,962
like something is broken, you

1064
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:29,446
know, what version that we were talking about.

1065
00:49:29,446 --> 00:49:31,349
We saw that there's a timestamp

1066
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:33,933
and we saw that there's a unique identifier.

1067
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,635
We can go back and check

1068
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:36,957
and there's some versioning, you

1069
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:39,301
know, we could unambiguously

1070
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:41,163
refer to something, you know,

1071
00:49:41,163 --> 00:49:42,546
this is the version that

1072
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,629
worked without, you know, sending

1073
00:49:44,629 --> 00:49:46,251
a folder, for example.

1074
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:49,710
And then when there's especially a bug,

1075
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,814
like something is broken, you

1076
00:49:50,814 --> 00:49:53,262
can find out where it was broken.

1077
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:55,308
You know, when it was

1078
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:57,736
broken, what broke it?

1079
00:49:57,736 --> 00:49:59,903
And then you could...

1080
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:02,144
go to the, go to the

1081
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:04,488
point where it was last worked

1082
00:50:04,488 --> 00:50:05,890
and then figure out more things.

1083
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:07,653
Um, yes.

1084
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:11,619
Uh, and also there is this, um, I mean,

1085
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:12,841
if you look, if you, this

1086
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:14,464
is about, you know, somebody,

1087
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:17,168
um, wrote a thesis, but I had to, um,

1088
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:18,611
give an advanced warning that,

1089
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:21,054
you know, the Git word works with simple text.

1090
00:50:22,657 --> 00:50:25,121
Uh, do, can you explain

1091
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:27,085
what simple text is?

1092
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:33,477
It's maybe mostly like text

1093
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,122
files like TXT or like this

1094
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:37,445
kind of extensions, or you can

1095
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:39,408
also use some LaTeX.

1096
00:50:39,408 --> 00:50:40,030
Yeah.

1097
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:44,718
And may not be like, how about DocX?

1098
00:50:44,718 --> 00:50:48,105
Does it work like DocX or PPT?

1099
00:50:48,105 --> 00:50:48,145
No.

1100
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,609
So the Git works best when

1101
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:52,791
what you see and what your

1102
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:54,713
computer sees is the same.

1103
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:56,515
For example, if you have a docs file,

1104
00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:00,260
LibreOffice or Microsoft or Google Doc

1105
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,483
or whatever, when you bold

1106
00:51:02,483 --> 00:51:03,624
the text, for example, there's

1107
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,426
a lot of metadata behind.

1108
00:51:05,426 --> 00:51:07,449
So the actual text, what you

1109
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:09,031
see and what's on the

1110
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:10,927
computer is very different.

1111
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:12,551
So even if you change one

1112
00:51:12,551 --> 00:51:13,833
text or if you make a text

1113
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,096
bold, it will change a lot.

1114
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:18,784
So it's difficult to track changes.

1115
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,949
So if you have a thesis, for example,

1116
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:23,234
so this means that it's not a PDF

1117
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:24,998
or a Word document or a

1118
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,545
kind of document format with a

1119
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:31,480
lot of metadata, but it's plain text.

1120
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,384
For example, the document we see here,

1121
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:38,150
the markdown document, it's easy

1122
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,772
to version control this.

1123
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:42,076
You can version control this document.

1124
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:44,199
Okay.

1125
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,985
Is there any limit on how

1126
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:49,607
many files I can share?

1127
00:51:50,937 --> 00:51:54,101
Yeah, so there could be some

1128
00:51:54,101 --> 00:51:56,244
limits in the server side, but

1129
00:51:56,244 --> 00:52:02,913
Git, it works, it's not for very large files.

1130
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:06,297
It's for like code, computer code.

1131
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,521
But if you learn Git, then

1132
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:13,526
you can use other technology

1133
00:52:13,526 --> 00:52:16,270
which uses Git terminology and

1134
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,713
Git techniques to version control.

1135
00:52:18,713 --> 00:52:20,675
For example, if you are

1136
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,096
in machine learning, for example,

1137
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:24,078
you might use this hugging face.

1138
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:25,259
Yeah.

1139
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:27,281
They have like big models.

1140
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:28,622
And now the latest version

1141
00:52:28,622 --> 00:52:30,424
of the hugging face use

1142
00:52:30,424 --> 00:52:32,465
something similar to Git.

1143
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:35,088
It's like XGit or something.

1144
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:36,229
So you can use the Git,

1145
00:52:36,229 --> 00:52:37,850
add Git, all the commands we

1146
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,732
use, but with big data.

1147
00:52:39,732 --> 00:52:41,954
So conceptually, it's the same.

1148
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:43,275
But this Git we are

1149
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:45,737
talking today is focused on

1150
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:47,859
plain text, smaller files, larger

1151
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:48,700
files are okay.

1152
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,762
But for smaller plain text,

1153
00:52:51,884 --> 00:52:53,686
you'll keep repositories.

1154
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:54,547
Not for data.

1155
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:55,908
Okay.

1156
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:56,909
I mean, data in the sense

1157
00:52:56,909 --> 00:52:58,351
there could be like smaller data files.

1158
00:52:58,351 --> 00:52:59,392
That's something different.

1159
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:01,274
But let's say terabytes of

1160
00:53:01,274 --> 00:53:04,117
data is not version control in this way.

1161
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:04,978
But for that, you have

1162
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,901
Git LFS, for example, Git large file.

1163
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:10,324
And then the version that

1164
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:12,086
the hugging phase is using.

1165
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:13,307
And there are other technologies.

1166
00:53:13,307 --> 00:53:14,909
But if you know the concepts

1167
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:18,822
of Git, you can also use those setups.

1168
00:53:18,822 --> 00:53:21,428
Okay.

1169
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,552
And then another thing, [name], is

1170
00:53:23,552 --> 00:53:24,775
that I said like

1171
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:26,279
collaborative virtual control.

1172
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:28,062
Let's say there is code.

1173
00:53:28,062 --> 00:53:29,686
There is, let's say, a web interface.

1174
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,951
Here we are showing with a cartoon with,

1175
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:32,953
we want to try out a

1176
00:53:32,953 --> 00:53:34,517
sunglass and a hat, and we

1177
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:36,862
want to decide which one to use.

1178
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:39,166
Let's say you are implementing

1179
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,069
the sunglass part of it,

1180
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:43,493
and I'm implementing the hat part of it.

1181
00:53:43,493 --> 00:53:44,695
And we can independently,

1182
00:53:44,695 --> 00:53:46,277
without stepping on each other's toe,

1183
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:47,279
we can do a test and we

1184
00:53:47,279 --> 00:53:49,302
can check, and then we can

1185
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:51,165
collaborate to see what's good.

1186
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:54,310
And then we can combine at the end.

1187
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,653
without affecting the main

1188
00:53:56,736 --> 00:54:00,544
line of development so um the the code

1189
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:01,847
that works will remain and

1190
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,611
users will use it while that's

1191
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:05,596
happening we can have our own

1192
00:54:05,596 --> 00:54:08,061
uh i wouldn't call it like

1193
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:11,489
a full copies but but the

1194
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:14,092
Because when you create a

1195
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:16,054
branch, you don't actually

1196
00:54:16,054 --> 00:54:17,456
make multiple copies.

1197
00:54:17,456 --> 00:54:19,358
You just have some pointers to this.

1198
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:21,301
Then you can experiment.

1199
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:23,303
And then at the end, we can combine.

1200
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:24,504
Or maybe we can throw away

1201
00:54:24,504 --> 00:54:26,306
the hat and then keep the sunglass.

1202
00:54:27,268 --> 00:54:28,249
We call this merging.

1203
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:29,971
So we can come together at

1204
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:32,053
some point to make a consensus

1205
00:54:32,053 --> 00:54:33,955
and then combine the code.

1206
00:54:33,955 --> 00:54:34,837
Okay.

1207
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:36,298
Yeah, we will talk more about this later.

1208
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:38,341
Do you have anything more

1209
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,025
to mention about this, Iman?

1210
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:41,607
No, nothing much.

1211
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:46,755
So then we have the graph

1212
00:54:46,755 --> 00:54:48,418
that I can show you a little bit.

1213
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:52,985
So how the development works.

1214
00:54:52,985 --> 00:54:54,627
I hope the screen is good enough.

1215
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:57,151
If not, colleagues, please give me a shout.

1216
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:59,755
So different people have made

1217
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,259
branches and they did some development.

1218
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:03,781
And the arrow pointing to

1219
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:05,003
the black one means that

1220
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:07,664
They have brought in the

1221
00:55:07,664 --> 00:55:09,786
changes to the main branch.

1222
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:12,170
So the main branch would have that change.

1223
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,672
So you can branch out and

1224
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:14,933
branch in and merge.

1225
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:18,778
So this is like adding the sunglasses.

1226
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,341
Yes.

1227
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:21,262
Correct.

1228
00:55:21,262 --> 00:55:22,323
So this will be like the green.

1229
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:25,768
If they check the sunglass, it's good.

1230
00:55:25,768 --> 00:55:27,330
Now the main code has

1231
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,832
that sunglass feature.

1232
00:55:28,832 --> 00:55:28,932
Okay.

1233
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:32,996
And also the reproducibility,

1234
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:35,299
which means that, let's say,

1235
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,262
if you publish a paper today

1236
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:38,764
with a certain code that works

1237
00:55:38,764 --> 00:55:40,546
with a certain set of data,

1238
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:41,408
and then you can, in the

1239
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:43,891
paper, you can mention that I use this version.

1240
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,096
So after the paper is published, two

1241
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:48,979
or three years in the future,

1242
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,581
you did some modifications and

1243
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,383
it's not the same thing, then

1244
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,805
you don't have to worry about

1245
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:55,167
looking for what worked.

1246
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,069
You can point out, you

1247
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:58,412
know, our paper talks about this version.

1248
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,162
Here also we have an

1249
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:08,511
example that shows something called git blame.

1250
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:10,094
So the blame is not

1251
00:56:10,094 --> 00:56:11,856
necessarily to blame somebody

1252
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:14,360
for something they did.

1253
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,721
Savit, could you zoom in?

1254
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:17,224
Yes, yes.

1255
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:21,329
Let me make it a little bigger.

1256
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:23,713
Would that be okay?

1257
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,614
Yeah, this is good.

1258
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:24,987
Yeah.

1259
00:56:24,987 --> 00:56:28,273
So no need to read the fine text here.

1260
00:56:28,273 --> 00:56:29,114
What I want to show is

1261
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:31,939
that each line is annotated with

1262
00:56:31,939 --> 00:56:33,041
who did what when.

1263
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:35,426
So we can get help from

1264
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,389
that person, why you did that

1265
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:38,651
change, and we can get help

1266
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:41,476
from that person to get more details.

1267
00:56:41,476 --> 00:56:43,861
So Git records all this line by line.

1268
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:47,768
So another thing is that Git

1269
00:56:47,768 --> 00:56:49,289
Actually, it version code was

1270
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:51,491
like lines, not like text by text.

1271
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,933
So you could mention which

1272
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:56,076
line was modified by whom and when.

1273
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:02,461
Apart from that, you could mention, like

1274
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,363
if you want to send a part

1275
00:57:04,363 --> 00:57:06,345
of a code to somebody else,

1276
00:57:07,426 --> 00:57:10,388
you could, I'll close this additional windows.

1277
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,072
You could send a link.

1278
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:15,967
So this permanent link.

1279
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:18,531
do you use permanent links uh

1280
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:21,265
can't i send the file itself like uh

1281
00:57:21,265 --> 00:57:22,326
Yes.

1282
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:23,588
I mean, that's a very good point.

1283
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:24,929
You could send the file, then

1284
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:26,111
you have to write a lot

1285
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:27,432
of text about, you know, you

1286
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:29,956
have to look, I'm sending this

1287
00:57:29,956 --> 00:57:33,039
file and I'm referring to line 40 to 44.

1288
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:34,401
But if you send a link

1289
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:36,203
like this, it highlights and

1290
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,346
it shows unambiguously, this is

1291
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:39,127
what I'm talking about.

1292
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:41,229
They can copy and this code

1293
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:42,951
is in a way that, you know, let's say

1294
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:44,233
if you type this in an

1295
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:47,156
email, for example, it might not be aligned.

1296
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:48,058
You know, especially if like

1297
00:57:48,058 --> 00:57:49,199
Python script, for example, you

1298
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,948
might not be able to

1299
00:57:50,948 --> 00:57:51,949
make it work sometimes.

1300
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:56,797
And also email, some email,

1301
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,963
like firewalls, for example, might block code.

1302
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:05,169
All this could be avoided by this.

1303
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,532
The way to generate a link is

1304
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:09,816
that you go to the place where the code is,

1305
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,278
you click that, and you

1306
00:58:11,278 --> 00:58:16,285
click this, the three dots, and

1307
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,388
you can get a permanent link.

1308
00:58:18,388 --> 00:58:19,282
Okay.

1309
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:20,706
If you want multiple lines,

1310
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,091
you can click this.

1311
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:25,320
Hold that shift key on the keyboard.

1312
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:25,702
Okay.

1313
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:26,664
And then you can get a

1314
00:58:26,664 --> 00:58:29,212
range for a permanent link.

1315
00:58:29,212 --> 00:58:30,015
Nice.

1316
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,135
Right.

1317
00:58:32,714 --> 00:58:35,097
Typically, we take snapshots

1318
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:36,818
of software scripts, as we

1319
00:58:36,818 --> 00:58:39,621
mentioned, not complicated metadata

1320
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:43,185
included documents, even images.

1321
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:45,027
You could make versions of images,

1322
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:48,391
but the Git works best when

1323
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,875
the text is plain text.

1324
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,096
We have some discussion here.

1325
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,098
Our learners are also welcome

1326
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,706
to contribute in the shared document.

1327
00:58:57,706 --> 00:58:59,329
um so we see that there

1328
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:00,491
are somebody who's trying to

1329
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:01,994
version control i mean invent

1330
00:59:01,994 --> 00:59:04,780
a new version control system um

1331
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,804
create a folder with the specific date

1332
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:09,288
and make a copy do some modifications

1333
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:11,693
and create another folder yeah

1334
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:13,136
what is the issue with this

1335
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,599
so i think they are also

1336
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:16,182
doing the time stamping right

1337
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:18,887
here like they're keeping track of the files it

1338
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:22,837
Yes, but I mean, let's say

1339
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:25,041
if they want to combine 2020, some file

1340
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,926
and 2023, some file, that will

1341
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:29,729
not be very obvious how to do it.

1342
00:59:31,332 --> 00:59:33,276
And also like maybe they

1343
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:34,558
had to uncompress it, look for

1344
00:59:34,558 --> 00:59:36,582
the file, and there's no

1345
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:38,305
metadata associated with it.

1346
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:41,992
Like line by line annotation,

1347
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:44,416
like who did what was changed.

1348
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:45,498
That kind of things.

1349
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:49,063
And it's not easy to go and, I mean,

1350
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:50,826
the timestamp is there, but

1351
00:59:50,826 --> 00:59:52,869
maybe the 2024 February folder

1352
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:57,135
has some file that was changed on February,

1353
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,179
the last day on maybe some

1354
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,841
files on March 1st, but all

1355
01:00:00,841 --> 01:00:03,025
these things are in the February folder.

1356
01:00:04,206 --> 01:00:05,468
We don't want to keep that

1357
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,330
track in this way.

1358
01:00:07,592 --> 01:00:10,897
You could also mention more

1359
01:00:10,897 --> 01:00:13,306
details in the shared documents if you wish.

1360
01:00:13,306 --> 01:00:15,509
And also we would like to

1361
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:17,412
point out some issues with

1362
01:00:17,412 --> 01:00:18,333
version control as well.

1363
01:00:19,555 --> 01:00:21,297
You need to learn some things

1364
01:00:21,297 --> 01:00:24,182
like Git, the things we teach you.

1365
01:00:24,182 --> 01:00:25,323
But if you can manage the

1366
01:00:25,323 --> 01:00:26,685
first part of Code Refinery,

1367
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:27,707
I think you're more than

1368
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,370
equipped to start using Git.

1369
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:30,651
Okay.

1370
01:00:31,873 --> 01:00:33,255
So that's something you get

1371
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:36,059
from this class is that you

1372
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,921
can learn more later on as you needed.

1373
01:00:39,123 --> 01:00:40,545
But today we'll get started.

1374
01:00:41,993 --> 01:00:44,056
Sometimes collaborators, they don't

1375
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:45,198
like to use version control.

1376
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:48,904
Personally, I have never encountered it.

1377
01:00:48,904 --> 01:00:50,006
There was instances where there

1378
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:52,070
was some resistance, but at the

1379
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,055
end, when we see the benefits,

1380
01:00:56,217 --> 01:00:57,018
they start using it.

1381
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,464
Even if they don't use it,

1382
01:01:00,464 --> 01:01:03,128
we could use version control.

1383
01:01:03,128 --> 01:01:05,472
And then, for example, for

1384
01:01:05,472 --> 01:01:07,275
this repository that we are talking about,

1385
01:01:08,453 --> 01:01:10,635
collaborator could download a

1386
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:12,617
compressed file if they wish but

1387
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:14,599
we can still use you know

1388
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:15,680
this could be like kind

1389
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,663
of one-way um contribution but

1390
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:20,585
you know it's possible to share it

1391
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:21,646
if somebody don't want to use

1392
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:25,610
gift at all okay um so you know the the

1393
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,731
when i move windows is it

1394
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:28,693
too fast for the streaming or

1395
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:31,236
is it okay all right so it

1396
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:33,458
seems okay for me like okay

1397
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:35,760
let's see the document

1398
01:01:38,373 --> 01:01:40,216
Then by Git, not something

1399
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:42,059
else, it's easy to use.

1400
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:44,023
As we slightly mentioned,

1401
01:01:44,023 --> 01:01:44,824
it's very popular.

1402
01:01:44,824 --> 01:01:48,430
You might encounter it at some point.

1403
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,315
And also if you learn Git,

1404
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:54,200
you can use GitLab, Bitbucket,

1405
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,025
and GitHub interchangeably.

1406
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:58,527
If the code is in Git,

1407
01:01:58,527 --> 01:02:00,226
you can transfer the Git.

1408
01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:02,248
But the issues and other

1409
01:02:02,248 --> 01:02:04,931
additional things might not be transferable.

1410
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:06,372
But if you start using any

1411
01:02:06,372 --> 01:02:08,074
of this, it's easier to

1412
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:10,096
move to another platform.

1413
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:13,679
That's all I want to

1414
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,202
introduce during motivation, [name].

1415
01:02:16,202 --> 01:02:17,263
I'll just have a look

1416
01:02:17,263 --> 01:02:18,384
at the shared document to

1417
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:20,266
see whether there's any interesting questions.

1418
01:02:20,266 --> 01:02:23,088
Until you set up your

1419
01:02:23,088 --> 01:02:24,510
screen and inform [name] that

1420
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,471
you're going to share it.

1421
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:28,714
OK.

1422
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:31,764
Yeah, this is about in general.

1423
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:36,110
Yeah, the conda environments and all,

1424
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,512
please do that after the

1425
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:39,355
workshop, today's workshop, so then

1426
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,657
you can be prepared.

1427
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,363
Okay, I think [name] managed

1428
01:02:45,363 --> 01:02:48,287
to make it bigger without me making it,

1429
01:02:48,287 --> 01:02:50,210
but please [name] and [name]

1430
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,832
and [name], please inform us if

1431
01:02:51,832 --> 01:02:52,553
we had to do something.

1432
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,420
How the change are marked?

1433
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,443
There are some color code.

1434
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:04,995
Yeah, I think it's all covered.

1435
01:03:07,098 --> 01:03:09,321
Yeah, so they ask about the size.

1436
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:10,763
Our collaborators have mentioned

1437
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:14,388
there's some size or limitations,

1438
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:16,832
but if you learn how to

1439
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:17,994
use Git, you can use the

1440
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,337
same commands to control it.

1441
01:03:20,337 --> 01:03:20,838
Yes.

1442
01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:24,363
I'm switching the size to

1443
01:03:24,363 --> 01:03:26,356
be correct, but yeah, I...

1444
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:28,139
cannot select which uh screen

1445
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:29,821
share is showing so it was uh him

1446
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:31,103
and screenshot now it's zapris

1447
01:03:32,686 --> 01:03:35,390
okay maybe in any case go

1448
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,873
ahead and yeah can you zoom in

1449
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:40,998
a bit more i don't see

1450
01:03:40,998 --> 01:03:42,500
my screen on the streaming at

1451
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:51,280
least is it now human only yes okay

1452
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,201
okay hey man can you go

1453
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:53,423
through the things because it's

1454
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:55,605
already shared um yeah question nine

1455
01:03:55,605 --> 01:03:57,528
for example yeah i will go

1456
01:03:57,528 --> 01:03:59,971
through i will just need to

1457
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:03,796
change a few things but give me

1458
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:07,020
a second so can you see the

1459
01:04:11,485 --> 01:04:13,347
okay i can see the edit mode

1460
01:04:13,347 --> 01:04:16,576
of your uh yeah now i can see the yeah

1461
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:20,581
Yeah, so the question nine, for example,

1462
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:21,862
so the way I did goes

1463
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:23,925
on GitHub is maybe GitHub

1464
01:04:24,826 --> 01:04:26,888
related, but also GitLab, there is

1465
01:04:26,888 --> 01:04:27,489
a way to do it.

1466
01:04:30,753 --> 01:04:31,414
Please do zoom.

1467
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:32,395
Okay, the zoom in, we have

1468
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:33,997
to fix a little bit.

1469
01:04:33,997 --> 01:04:35,659
Sorry for that inconvenience.

1470
01:04:35,659 --> 01:04:38,883
If the text was too small, we will fix it.

1471
01:04:38,883 --> 01:04:40,985
I think, [name], you could

1472
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:42,467
start with your part already.

1473
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:43,288
And [name], I'm going to

1474
01:04:43,288 --> 01:04:45,030
stop sharing my screen now.

1475
01:04:52,503 --> 01:04:54,225
so can you see my screen or

1476
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:56,488
like i see your share document

1477
01:04:56,488 --> 01:05:01,275
okay it's like uh let me top

1478
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:11,389
the share and yeah give me a second

1479
01:05:16,297 --> 01:05:20,100
So until [name] set up that screen,

1480
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,402
so the next lesson would be

1481
01:05:21,402 --> 01:05:25,665
about some more basics and we

1482
01:05:25,665 --> 01:05:29,469
will start with the browsing part

1483
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:31,270
that also you could, you only

1484
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:34,033
need the GitHub to do that.

1485
01:05:37,235 --> 01:05:38,697
Yes, I can still see

1486
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:40,238
your shared document, [name].

1487
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:41,399
Okay.

1488
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,483
And actually I can't see the zoom controls.

1489
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:45,763
Yes.

1490
01:05:48,123 --> 01:05:48,924
Okay.

1491
01:05:48,924 --> 01:05:50,205
We are currently showing

1492
01:05:50,205 --> 01:05:51,386
the shared document.

1493
01:05:52,387 --> 01:05:52,587
Okay.

1494
01:05:52,587 --> 01:05:54,809
Nobody's currently sharing the screen.

1495
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:55,509
Yeah.

1496
01:05:55,509 --> 01:05:59,813
Okay.

1497
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:01,094
Okay.

1498
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:02,135
Now I find it.

1499
01:06:02,135 --> 01:06:02,695
Let me share that.

1500
01:06:03,776 --> 01:06:04,017
All right.

1501
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,361
So can you see it?

1502
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:12,224
I'm switching over to your screen share.

1503
01:06:12,224 --> 01:06:12,524
Okay.

1504
01:06:15,566 --> 01:06:17,488
That's good.

1505
01:06:19,662 --> 01:06:20,283
Is it better?

1506
01:06:24,288 --> 01:06:25,150
Just a moment.

1507
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:29,355
Let's try again.

1508
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:32,019
And yes, now it looks good.

1509
01:06:34,382 --> 01:06:41,933
Let me zoom in a bit.

1510
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:42,394
Okay.

1511
01:06:43,255 --> 01:06:43,515
Yep.

1512
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:44,877
Yes.

1513
01:06:46,274 --> 01:06:49,638
so yeah we can currently i

1514
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:53,063
am in this uh the main page of the workshop

1515
01:06:53,063 --> 01:06:54,845
so now uh i will talk

1516
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,328
about the browsing which you can

1517
01:06:57,328 --> 01:06:59,651
access in the day one okay

1518
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:01,173
so basically what we are going

1519
01:07:01,173 --> 01:07:03,195
to do today is like uh we

1520
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:06,119
are going to look at an existing repository

1521
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:08,505
basically, and then we try

1522
01:07:08,505 --> 01:07:11,853
to understand how the repository is built.

1523
01:07:11,853 --> 01:07:12,936
And then later we try

1524
01:07:12,936 --> 01:07:15,081
to fork the repository, which means

1525
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:16,284
that we are taking a copy

1526
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:18,269
of the repository and then try

1527
01:07:18,269 --> 01:07:20,494
to modify and do some changes.

1528
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,960
So that's what we are going to do now.

1529
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,331
So basically, it's like different

1530
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:29,894
ways of doing it.

1531
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:33,562
Today, we will mostly focus on the GitHub,

1532
01:07:33,562 --> 01:07:34,965
but you can also use your

1533
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:37,149
favorite like a VS Code or

1534
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:39,835
command line and then try to do it.

1535
01:07:39,835 --> 01:07:41,598
So in the day one, we

1536
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:43,380
will mostly focus on GitHub.

1537
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,904
In the coming days, we will

1538
01:07:45,904 --> 01:07:47,587
talk about the rest of the things.

1539
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:51,633
So what I'm going to do

1540
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:54,758
is I'm going to take this repository,

1541
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:56,841
which was created for this workshop,

1542
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:59,465
which is CR workshop exercises,

1543
01:07:59,465 --> 01:08:01,388
and you can actually access

1544
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,014
this using the links here.

1545
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,898
So the first link is for

1546
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:10,120
participants and the second link is

1547
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,803
for uh the people for the instructors

1548
01:08:12,803 --> 01:08:15,165
which is [name] and me so basically

1549
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:16,487
what you're going to do now

1550
01:08:16,487 --> 01:08:18,349
is like uh you try to open

1551
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:20,311
this link in a new tab and

1552
01:08:20,311 --> 01:08:23,093
then we will go through it okay so

1553
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:24,775
so the thing with these two

1554
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:26,096
links him on is the difference

1555
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:27,518
is that the one would people

1556
01:08:27,518 --> 01:08:28,599
see it in the camera on

1557
01:08:28,599 --> 01:08:30,261
the during the recording so we

1558
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:31,922
have created two links so the

1559
01:08:31,922 --> 01:08:34,465
we we can avoid showing

1560
01:08:34,465 --> 01:08:36,687
other people's usernames so

1561
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:38,108
when you use it use the

1562
01:08:38,108 --> 01:08:39,850
recipe book not the recipe

1563
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,594
book dash record recorded so only

1564
01:08:43,594 --> 01:08:48,099
use this one okay the one the first one

1565
01:08:48,099 --> 01:08:49,320
so now i'm going to open

1566
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,684
the link so i'm opening the link

1567
01:08:53,684 --> 01:09:04,315
in a new tab so i will slightly zoom in so yeah

1568
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:06,864
So basically, it's like this

1569
01:09:06,864 --> 01:09:08,146
is the repository.

1570
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:13,395
And is the font enough, [name]?

1571
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:15,137
Yeah, I think it's good enough, yes.

1572
01:09:15,137 --> 01:09:16,259
OK, OK, yeah.

1573
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:20,266
So yeah, basically, this is the repository,

1574
01:09:20,266 --> 01:09:22,289
which is you can see the

1575
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:23,751
name of the repository, which

1576
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:26,215
is recipe book recorded.

1577
01:09:26,215 --> 01:09:28,840
and then it is under

1578
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:33,109
this organization cr-workshop-exercises, okay?

1579
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,571
So basically what we are going

1580
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,115
to do today is we are

1581
01:09:36,115 --> 01:09:38,940
going to first navigate what is there,

1582
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,684
what is here, and then we

1583
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:43,429
are going to basically take a

1584
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,255
copy of this repository and

1585
01:09:46,255 --> 01:09:48,018
do some changes, okay?

1586
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,362
So in order to do

1587
01:09:49,362 --> 01:09:52,289
the fork, basically, there should

1588
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,252
be a fork icon.

1589
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:53,693
Yes.

1590
01:09:53,693 --> 01:09:56,681
If you slightly zoom in, you

1591
01:09:56,681 --> 01:09:57,964
can see the fork icon here.

1592
01:09:57,964 --> 01:10:01,313
So what is a fork?

1593
01:10:01,313 --> 01:10:03,425
Why do we need that, [name]?

1594
01:10:03,425 --> 01:10:05,187
Okay, basically, it's like,

1595
01:10:05,187 --> 01:10:07,831
so this repository belongs to someone else.

1596
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:09,713
And basically, if you want

1597
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:12,257
to do some changes, okay, it's

1598
01:10:12,257 --> 01:10:14,359
better to make a copy of

1599
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:17,524
the documents, like all the files,

1600
01:10:17,524 --> 01:10:19,306
and then you can modify the

1601
01:10:19,306 --> 01:10:21,329
changes in your local repository

1602
01:10:21,329 --> 01:10:22,270
in your local files.

1603
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,071
Okay.

1604
01:10:23,071 --> 01:10:26,155
And basically, that's what we do.

1605
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,877
in while doing the forking

1606
01:10:27,877 --> 01:10:31,402
okay copy uh copy for yourself

1607
01:10:31,402 --> 01:10:33,965
in the cloud itself so maybe

1608
01:10:33,965 --> 01:10:34,826
you don't have access to

1609
01:10:34,826 --> 01:10:36,048
modify these files because this

1610
01:10:36,048 --> 01:10:38,191
is somebody else's repository but

1611
01:10:38,191 --> 01:10:39,012
if you are allowed to copy

1612
01:10:39,012 --> 01:10:40,874
it you can make a copy and

1613
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:42,396
do things by yourself today

1614
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:43,598
today that's what you want to

1615
01:10:43,598 --> 01:10:45,781
sort of practice on your own yeah

1616
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:47,623
so now if you click on this fork

1617
01:10:48,903 --> 01:10:51,847
then it will open this create

1618
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,989
a new fork window.

1619
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:56,393
Basically here, it's like we

1620
01:10:56,393 --> 01:10:57,915
write some name.

1621
01:10:57,915 --> 01:11:01,179
So it is automatically predefined,

1622
01:11:01,179 --> 01:11:03,261
which is recipe book, recipe

1623
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:05,144
dash book dash recorded.

1624
01:11:05,144 --> 01:11:07,006
Here you can write some optional.

1625
01:11:07,006 --> 01:11:11,612
Okay, we will use it for teaching.

1626
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:13,102
Okay, basically so.

1627
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,247
And then when you click on

1628
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:19,471
this, I will uncheck this box,

1629
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,535
copy the main branch only, and

1630
01:11:21,535 --> 01:11:23,017
then try to create the fork.

1631
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:24,559
So if you press the screen.

1632
01:11:24,559 --> 01:11:25,100
What does that mean?

1633
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,262
What happens if you clicked it?

1634
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,508
Basically, it will copy all

1635
01:11:30,508 --> 01:11:32,331
the files, including other

1636
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,213
people's branches also.

1637
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:35,575
Right now, we just want to

1638
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:36,957
copy only the main branch.

1639
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:42,045
But then we should uncheck it, isn't it?

1640
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:44,747
yeah sorry yeah we should

1641
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:46,750
check this yeah but i think it's it's good

1642
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,992
that we copy everybody else's

1643
01:11:47,992 --> 01:11:50,256
branches then they can see that branch

1644
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:52,299
and everything yeah because i

1645
01:11:52,299 --> 01:11:54,082
also did some changes so in

1646
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:56,806
case if yeah go ahead but

1647
01:11:56,806 --> 01:11:59,230
but let's see okay either way is

1648
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:04,759
fine so it will take a time like i'm

1649
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:09,624
So yeah, basically, yes.

1650
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:11,890
Now I forked this branch.

1651
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:15,780
So what you can see is like, so this,

1652
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:19,188
I forked from this CR

1653
01:12:19,188 --> 01:12:21,935
workshop exercises, the one highlighted here.

1654
01:12:21,935 --> 01:12:24,239
This is what we call upstream.

1655
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,501
This is where we actually

1656
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:28,345
forked the repository.

1657
01:12:29,307 --> 01:12:36,499
Now, if you see the link

1658
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:39,984
above, it should be your user account.

1659
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:41,807
Basically, it's your username

1660
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:44,051
for the GitHub.

1661
01:12:44,051 --> 01:12:45,914
That is what you should

1662
01:12:45,914 --> 01:12:48,799
be following for the next of the

1663
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:52,445
for the today's lectures okay

1664
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:56,632
and so now we will go

1665
01:12:56,632 --> 01:12:59,717
back to the main window and

1666
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:01,620
then we will mostly like do

1667
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:06,428
some exercises okay so uh now

1668
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:08,331
uh [name] is this the time for

1669
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:10,495
like uh should we take a break

1670
01:13:10,495 --> 01:13:12,458
now or should we do the exercises

1671
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:14,520
So what we do is, Sehman,

1672
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,602
now we break for 10 minutes.

1673
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:17,503
Okay.

1674
01:13:17,503 --> 01:13:18,684
And then when we come back,

1675
01:13:18,684 --> 01:13:21,487
we can discuss the exercise.

1676
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,188
Because when we say break,

1677
01:13:23,188 --> 01:13:24,450
we expect people to walk around

1678
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,731
a little bit and have a break,

1679
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:27,192
not look at the exercise.

1680
01:13:27,192 --> 01:13:28,133
Okay.

1681
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:29,855
So [name] and [name], we're going

1682
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,316
to have a break now.

1683
01:13:31,316 --> 01:13:32,217
If you could share the

1684
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:34,700
shared document with 10 minutes break.

1685
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:37,382
And we'll come back in

1686
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:39,124
another 10 minutes according to the time zone.

1687
01:13:44,116 --> 01:13:46,063
Are you ready, [name]?

1688
01:13:46,063 --> 01:13:46,706
Sorry, [name]?

1689
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:48,412
Let's go on a break.

1690
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:49,878
All right.

1691
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:50,059
Bye.

1692
01:13:51,584 --> 01:13:52,568
Yes.

1693
01:13:52,568 --> 01:13:53,873
Bye for now.

1694
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:14,714
Hi, welcome back from the break.

1695
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:17,318
I hope you had you

1696
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:18,500
just stretched your legs.

1697
01:23:19,783 --> 01:23:20,985
And so you can hear me

1698
01:23:20,985 --> 01:23:22,527
right like all of you.

1699
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:23,930
Yeah, OK, great.

1700
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:25,572
So what we're going to do

1701
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:27,896
now is like this exercise.

1702
01:23:27,896 --> 01:23:30,801
So basically it's like you just

1703
01:23:30,801 --> 01:23:32,585
took a copy like a fork

1704
01:23:32,585 --> 01:23:34,448
of the repository which was shown above.

1705
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:37,492
OK, so using this link.

1706
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:39,775
Now, what you're going to do

1707
01:23:39,775 --> 01:23:43,599
is go to that link and do these exercises.

1708
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:48,945
There are eight exercise questions.

1709
01:23:50,647 --> 01:23:52,629
First, you try to look

1710
01:23:52,629 --> 01:23:54,311
into each question and there

1711
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:56,493
are some hints here and how to do that.

1712
01:23:57,414 --> 01:23:59,156
For suppose in the first one,

1713
01:23:59,156 --> 01:24:01,699
you try to look at the commit history.

1714
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:05,183
To look at the commit history,

1715
01:24:05,183 --> 01:24:07,707
Basically, what you're going to

1716
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:10,891
do is here is a small icon,

1717
01:24:10,891 --> 01:24:13,254
which is like, can you see the icon?

1718
01:24:14,396 --> 01:24:14,877
Maybe a little.

1719
01:24:14,877 --> 01:24:16,118
The circle.

1720
01:24:16,118 --> 01:24:18,121
It may be.

1721
01:24:18,121 --> 01:24:20,685
The circle, if you go to this repository,

1722
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:22,467
which you just forked, you

1723
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:25,491
should see here your username and

1724
01:24:25,491 --> 01:24:28,556
then on the URL.

1725
01:24:28,556 --> 01:24:30,378
Here, when you zoom in, you

1726
01:24:30,378 --> 01:24:33,803
can see a small circle, like a timestamp.

1727
01:24:33,803 --> 01:24:35,528
When you click on it,

1728
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:39,820
basically what you can see is

1729
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,610
some commits made earlier.

1730
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,673
Basically, you have to go

1731
01:24:44,673 --> 01:24:46,739
through this commit history and

1732
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:48,805
try to see what has been done.

1733
01:24:48,805 --> 01:24:51,488
and then later like uh you

1734
01:24:51,488 --> 01:24:53,511
will also try to find another

1735
01:24:53,511 --> 01:24:55,273
way of looking at it like which

1736
01:24:55,273 --> 01:24:58,357
is uh you can use this insights

1737
01:24:58,357 --> 01:25:00,500
on the on this main page okay

1738
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:02,883
and then try to see what

1739
01:25:02,883 --> 01:25:04,825
is happening in this ins when

1740
01:25:04,825 --> 01:25:06,607
you click on insights and when

1741
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:07,809
you click on the network

1742
01:25:07,809 --> 01:25:09,511
within that insights okay

1743
01:25:09,511 --> 01:25:12,176
so then also try to find

1744
01:25:12,176 --> 01:25:16,164
out when the recipe was last modified

1745
01:25:16,164 --> 01:25:17,687
so what you're going to see

1746
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:20,012
is like this is a like

1747
01:25:20,012 --> 01:25:22,637
basically a recipe book for food

1748
01:25:22,637 --> 01:25:24,941
like cooking so you are going

1749
01:25:24,941 --> 01:25:27,787
to find like some food recipes okay it's like

1750
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:31,995
and you try to find take one recipe

1751
01:25:31,995 --> 01:25:33,578
for suppose a salad or something

1752
01:25:33,578 --> 01:25:35,261
and then see like when

1753
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,766
the this repository was modified

1754
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,850
or when the file was the

1755
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:42,856
recipe not not like python or c code

1756
01:25:42,856 --> 01:25:45,600
Basically, it's like when you

1757
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,422
look at this Git page.

1758
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,185
Here you can see there

1759
01:25:50,185 --> 01:25:54,831
are some desserts, pasta, salad, side soups.

1760
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:58,616
Let's first suppose we look at salads.

1761
01:25:58,616 --> 01:26:03,042
Here there are different salads

1762
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:05,485
in this file.

1763
01:26:05,485 --> 01:26:08,529
So first, suppose this is a Andhra salad.

1764
01:26:08,529 --> 01:26:13,036
And basically, this is from my home place.

1765
01:26:13,036 --> 01:26:16,781
And you can find what this recipe is about.

1766
01:26:16,781 --> 01:26:17,842
If you want to cook something,

1767
01:26:17,842 --> 01:26:20,266
then you can actually look into this recipe.

1768
01:26:20,266 --> 01:26:22,429
So basically, it's like each

1769
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:27,676
one has different recipes in this codebook.

1770
01:26:27,676 --> 01:26:29,558
One reason that it is a

1771
01:26:29,558 --> 01:26:31,280
codebook, like not a programming

1772
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,942
language is that we want to

1773
01:26:33,942 --> 01:26:35,184
be just focusing on the Git

1774
01:26:35,184 --> 01:26:37,566
concept itself and the GitHub

1775
01:26:37,566 --> 01:26:38,787
and the interface.

1776
01:26:38,787 --> 01:26:40,929
So even people don't know, understand,

1777
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,071
if you're not working with

1778
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:43,712
Python, you still understand the concept.

1779
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,175
So that's why it's abstracted

1780
01:26:46,175 --> 01:26:48,757
into a cooking recipe instead of like code.

1781
01:26:48,757 --> 01:26:49,638
But in real life, you

1782
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:52,601
will be interacting with code when you do this.

1783
01:26:53,762 --> 01:26:54,443
Nice.

1784
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:58,943
So yeah, let's go back to the exercise.

1785
01:26:58,943 --> 01:27:00,765
So then you will also

1786
01:27:00,765 --> 01:27:03,370
find this guacamole recipe, okay,

1787
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:04,792
which is under the sides.

1788
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:05,914
So basically, you try to

1789
01:27:05,914 --> 01:27:08,057
like look into these exercises and

1790
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:09,820
try to do these exercises

1791
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:12,825
following on the repository, which

1792
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:14,247
you just made a copy of

1793
01:27:14,247 --> 01:27:16,191
it, or which is forking it.

1794
01:27:16,191 --> 01:27:16,671
Okay.

1795
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:18,194
Yeah, that's very important.

1796
01:27:18,194 --> 01:27:19,516
You know, look at your copy.

1797
01:27:19,516 --> 01:27:21,719
yeah one one one one that

1798
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:23,782
says you know without the recorded

1799
01:27:23,782 --> 01:27:26,866
uh prefix uh yeah it should be

1800
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:29,049
like uh here is your it

1801
01:27:29,049 --> 01:27:30,551
should be your username the

1802
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:32,194
one highlighted your repository will

1803
01:27:32,194 --> 01:27:34,537
be like this one https

1804
01:27:34,537 --> 01:27:37,341
colon slash slash github.com

1805
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:40,045
slash your username slash recipe

1806
01:27:40,045 --> 01:27:43,049
dash book and yeah please go

1807
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,651
uh take a look into this one

1808
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:46,634
and try to do the exercises

1809
01:27:46,634 --> 01:27:47,075
Yes.

1810
01:27:47,075 --> 01:27:48,198
So now what we're going to

1811
01:27:48,198 --> 01:27:49,922
do is we're going to break now.

1812
01:27:49,922 --> 01:27:52,648
I mean, break means that we will not talk.

1813
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,572
And we'll give you 25 minutes.

1814
01:27:54,572 --> 01:27:55,976
And [name] will share the

1815
01:27:55,976 --> 01:27:56,998
shared document now.

1816
01:27:56,998 --> 01:27:59,925
And we give you 25 minutes.

1817
01:27:59,925 --> 01:28:01,400
Is that enough for him on?

1818
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,283
Yeah, I think 25 minutes is good.

1819
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:04,386
And I think they also

1820
01:28:04,386 --> 01:28:07,091
have local instructors, like basically

1821
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:09,455
at each hosting site.

1822
01:28:09,455 --> 01:28:10,417
Now we expect you to

1823
01:28:11,879 --> 01:28:13,643
go through this exercise and do that.

1824
01:28:13,643 --> 01:28:14,284
And if you have any

1825
01:28:14,284 --> 01:28:16,067
questions, use the shared document

1826
01:28:16,067 --> 01:28:18,612
to inform us, you know, any issues

1827
01:28:18,612 --> 01:28:19,373
that you have or any

1828
01:28:19,373 --> 01:28:20,796
discussions that you want to participate in.

1829
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,120
And also maybe we can place

1830
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,244
a poll in the...

1831
01:28:25,244 --> 01:28:26,365
share document to see if

1832
01:28:26,365 --> 01:28:28,488
you are finished give us some notice

1833
01:28:28,488 --> 01:28:29,990
that so we don't have to wait

1834
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,592
if you're already finished and

1835
01:28:31,592 --> 01:28:35,657
i would recommend him on that

1836
01:28:35,657 --> 01:28:37,359
maybe up to six is enough so

1837
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,044
six is the number six okay

1838
01:28:41,044 --> 01:28:42,426
yeah sixth question up to go

1839
01:28:42,426 --> 01:28:43,387
out to six question and the

1840
01:28:43,387 --> 01:28:44,829
seven and eight is bonus for

1841
01:28:44,829 --> 01:28:47,091
you yeah and we'll see within

1842
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:51,097
the first 25 minutes try to go up to six okay

1843
01:28:51,097 --> 01:28:52,741
Okay, Anu, now we're going

1844
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,285
to share the shared document

1845
01:28:54,285 --> 01:28:56,972
and indicate that 25 minutes of exercise time.

1846
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:57,894
And then we come back

1847
01:28:57,894 --> 01:29:00,661
and Haman will explain the answers.

1848
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:02,525
Is that a good plan, Haman?

1849
01:29:02,525 --> 01:29:04,009
Yeah, it sounds good.

1850
01:54:11,332 --> 01:54:16,522
hi welcome back so i hope

1851
01:54:16,522 --> 01:54:19,829
you guys were doing the exercises i see

1852
01:54:19,829 --> 01:54:21,913
that about 20 people finished

1853
01:54:21,913 --> 01:54:24,598
the exercise so now i will

1854
01:54:24,598 --> 01:54:25,841
just quickly go through the

1855
01:54:25,841 --> 01:54:29,388
solutions okay so let's look at the first uh

1856
01:54:29,388 --> 01:54:32,073
exercise which is like browsing

1857
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:32,955
the commit history.

1858
01:54:34,538 --> 01:54:36,402
Now I will switch the tab.

1859
01:54:37,504 --> 01:54:39,287
Basically, if I go to the

1860
01:54:39,287 --> 01:54:42,033
code to the main page, so for

1861
01:54:42,033 --> 01:54:43,075
you it is the user.

1862
01:54:44,197 --> 01:54:51,531
If you click on this time circle here,

1863
01:54:53,232 --> 01:54:54,534
It will then go to this

1864
01:54:54,534 --> 01:54:57,279
page where you can see like

1865
01:54:57,279 --> 01:54:58,861
the commits, all the commits

1866
01:54:58,861 --> 01:55:01,786
which were made from all the people.

1867
01:55:01,786 --> 01:55:04,330
So this one is the commits

1868
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:07,315
which I made yesterday and

1869
01:55:07,315 --> 01:55:09,840
[name] made few commits also.

1870
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,122
And then we have also some

1871
01:55:11,122 --> 01:55:13,145
commits from the last year.

1872
01:55:13,145 --> 01:55:15,008
and what you can see here

1873
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:17,532
is like each commit has a

1874
01:55:17,532 --> 01:55:21,077
some specific like a is a name like

1875
01:55:21,077 --> 01:55:23,261
for suppose restoring the tests

1876
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:26,265
and when it is committed and

1877
01:55:26,265 --> 01:55:27,728
there is a unique id like

1878
01:55:27,728 --> 01:55:29,250
as a subrim mentioned in the

1879
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:31,393
motivation for each commit you

1880
01:55:31,393 --> 01:55:32,675
make you will have a one

1881
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:35,099
id associated to it okay

1882
01:55:35,099 --> 01:55:36,942
so that you can easily revert back

1883
01:55:36,942 --> 01:55:37,943
or you can look into uh

1884
01:55:39,005 --> 01:55:41,909
what has been in the commit okay so

1885
01:55:41,909 --> 01:55:44,192
if you click on that uh

1886
01:55:44,192 --> 01:55:46,716
hash code you can see this one okay

1887
01:55:46,716 --> 01:55:48,038
so these are the green ones

1888
01:55:48,038 --> 01:55:49,960
are the changes which are made

1889
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,803
and the minus ones are some

1890
01:55:51,803 --> 01:55:53,986
like the previous ones so that

1891
01:55:53,986 --> 01:56:05,022
is about uh basically so the green one

1892
01:56:06,065 --> 01:56:08,229
Now let's go to the next

1893
01:56:08,229 --> 01:56:14,539
question, which is about the network graph.

1894
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:17,003
I will again go back to the main code page.

1895
01:56:18,185 --> 01:56:21,791
This is the main page which you forked.

1896
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:23,834
So far we looked at the

1897
01:56:23,834 --> 01:56:26,078
commits which were changed linearly.

1898
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:30,306
Now, if you basically click

1899
01:56:30,306 --> 01:56:32,411
these three dots, like basically

1900
01:56:32,411 --> 01:56:33,733
for me, since I am zooming

1901
01:56:33,733 --> 01:56:37,340
in, so it is here for me in this insights.

1902
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,663
If you click on this insights,

1903
01:56:39,525 --> 01:56:42,010
you will you can then see all these things.

1904
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:42,871
So now I'm going to

1905
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:44,675
click this network here.

1906
01:56:44,675 --> 01:56:47,459
When you click on the network,

1907
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:49,241
what you can see is here

1908
01:56:49,241 --> 01:56:52,745
is the history of the commits.

1909
01:56:52,745 --> 01:56:57,111
I will just drag it.

1910
01:56:57,111 --> 01:56:58,372
Here is these are the

1911
01:56:58,372 --> 01:57:00,575
commits which we made, [name] and me.

1912
01:57:01,516 --> 01:57:04,100
The main black line is

1913
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,784
the main repository when we took the branch.

1914
01:57:07,784 --> 01:57:09,667
You can see the timestamp

1915
01:57:09,667 --> 01:57:13,852
and other things, what each commit we did.

1916
01:57:13,852 --> 01:57:16,775
With this, you get a big overview of

1917
01:57:16,775 --> 01:57:19,277
what has been done, like

1918
01:57:20,298 --> 01:57:24,222
when you forked the branch and

1919
01:57:24,222 --> 01:57:27,506
then when you started committing it back.

1920
01:57:27,506 --> 01:57:34,212
These are the big overlook of the commits.

1921
01:57:34,212 --> 01:57:35,854
Each dot is a commit.

1922
01:57:36,955 --> 01:57:38,477
For suppose here, you are

1923
01:57:38,477 --> 01:57:40,939
just forking that part.

1924
01:57:42,775 --> 01:57:44,857
Next, let's look at the next question.

1925
01:57:45,758 --> 01:57:47,900
How can you find out when

1926
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:49,442
a recipe was last modified?

1927
01:57:50,263 --> 01:57:52,785
So let's go back to the repository.

1928
01:57:54,887 --> 01:57:56,329
And let's go to the main page.

1929
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:00,033
So let's say let's pick up some recipe,

1930
01:58:00,033 --> 01:58:02,435
say for suppose salads and

1931
01:58:02,435 --> 01:58:04,517
let's make a mixed salad.

1932
01:58:05,458 --> 01:58:07,280
So here basically it's like

1933
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,963
here is the recipe and you

1934
01:58:09,963 --> 01:58:12,225
can look at the history.

1935
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:18,427
Oh, maybe, yeah, you can

1936
01:58:18,427 --> 01:58:25,756
look, you can click on the code.

1937
01:58:25,756 --> 01:58:28,139
So the question was, um, how can,

1938
01:58:28,139 --> 01:58:30,942
if I read last modified, so I see that,

1939
01:58:30,942 --> 01:58:33,505
uh, on the top, um, like

1940
01:58:33,505 --> 01:58:34,487
near the clock, it says it

1941
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:36,252
was modified last year.

1942
01:58:36,252 --> 01:58:37,073
Yeah.

1943
01:58:37,073 --> 01:58:37,574
Okay.

1944
01:58:37,574 --> 01:58:40,317
So, and then, okay, that is the question.

1945
01:58:40,317 --> 01:58:41,919
So now it's like to see

1946
01:58:41,919 --> 01:58:43,721
when is it last modified.

1947
01:58:43,721 --> 01:58:45,443
Here again, when you open the file,

1948
01:58:45,443 --> 01:58:46,604
you can see this again,

1949
01:58:46,604 --> 01:58:49,147
this circle, the time circle.

1950
01:58:50,108 --> 01:58:52,871
And if you click on this circle,

1951
01:58:52,871 --> 01:58:54,233
which shows you all the

1952
01:58:54,233 --> 01:58:56,295
history of the commits of this file.

1953
01:58:56,295 --> 01:58:56,936
Okay.

1954
01:58:56,936 --> 01:58:57,837
So these are the commits,

1955
01:58:57,837 --> 01:58:59,619
which you can see, like it

1956
01:58:59,619 --> 01:59:01,822
was created in March 5th, and

1957
01:59:01,822 --> 01:59:04,585
there are some fixes to this file.

1958
01:59:04,585 --> 01:59:07,188
okay so that is this uh

1959
01:59:07,188 --> 01:59:10,172
the third question and now let's go back

1960
01:59:10,172 --> 01:59:11,393
and see what is the next question

1961
01:59:12,314 --> 01:59:13,175
so the next question is

1962
01:59:13,175 --> 01:59:14,517
how many changes did the

1963
01:59:14,517 --> 01:59:17,501
coca-cola recipe receive so you

1964
01:59:17,501 --> 01:59:20,084
can find this coca-cola recipe under sites

1965
01:59:21,145 --> 01:59:22,467
and then try to click on

1966
01:59:22,467 --> 01:59:23,828
some of the comments to see

1967
01:59:23,828 --> 01:59:25,390
what changed okay let's do that

1968
01:59:26,371 --> 01:59:27,873
so now i'm going back i

1969
01:59:27,873 --> 01:59:29,075
can read the question for him so

1970
01:59:29,075 --> 01:59:30,677
you can stay in the github

1971
01:59:30,677 --> 01:59:34,353
okay yeah that would be great

1972
01:59:34,353 --> 01:59:38,619
okay now i will go back yeah okay

1973
01:59:38,619 --> 01:59:40,141
so let's uh look at the

1974
01:59:40,141 --> 01:59:42,925
salads it's in the salads right go come on

1975
01:59:42,925 --> 01:59:44,207
how many changes the goku molly

1976
01:59:44,207 --> 01:59:45,549
is i think the side i think

1977
01:59:45,549 --> 01:59:48,293
it's a side sites and actually

1978
01:59:48,293 --> 01:59:49,574
if you don't know where to find

1979
01:59:49,574 --> 01:59:52,198
it there is a search button here

1980
01:59:52,198 --> 01:59:53,159
and you can use the search

1981
01:59:53,159 --> 01:59:57,425
button yeah with this zooming in

1982
01:59:57,425 --> 02:00:02,773
i don't it's on the top the

1983
02:00:04,981 --> 02:00:06,325
So here you can.

1984
02:00:14,251 --> 02:00:15,555
I'm sorry here go to file.

1985
02:00:16,618 --> 02:00:18,163
Here you can look for a guacamole.

1986
02:00:21,046 --> 02:00:24,212
So let me, I think I did it fast.

1987
02:00:24,212 --> 02:00:25,555
If you click, if you look

1988
02:00:25,555 --> 02:00:27,639
here, you can find go to file.

1989
02:00:27,639 --> 02:00:29,262
And basically what you can do is like,

1990
02:00:29,262 --> 02:00:30,124
you can, if you know the

1991
02:00:30,124 --> 02:00:31,627
file name, you can type here

1992
02:00:31,627 --> 02:00:34,693
and you can click find the file.

1993
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:35,275
Okay.

1994
02:00:35,275 --> 02:00:37,058
It only works for the file names.

1995
02:00:37,058 --> 02:00:37,499
Okay.

1996
02:00:37,499 --> 02:00:40,884
so here is the guacamole recipe okay

1997
02:00:40,884 --> 02:00:43,568
and then now the question is like

1998
02:00:43,568 --> 02:00:46,833
how many how many how many changes okay

1999
02:00:46,833 --> 02:00:47,894
so now let's again look

2000
02:00:47,894 --> 02:00:50,578
at the history using this time stamp circle

2001
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,182
and so how many are there actually

2002
02:00:54,204 --> 02:00:56,928
so one two three four five

2003
02:00:56,928 --> 02:00:58,891
so there are five changes five

2004
02:00:58,891 --> 02:01:02,376
commits okay yes so the number

2005
02:01:02,376 --> 02:01:04,679
five is which recipe includes

2006
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:07,250
the ingredient salt salt

2007
02:01:07,250 --> 02:01:09,393
salt okay so now i will

2008
02:01:09,393 --> 02:01:13,459
again go back to the main one code now

2009
02:01:13,459 --> 02:01:15,121
since we already looked in

2010
02:01:15,121 --> 02:01:17,445
terms of searching for the file okay

2011
02:01:17,445 --> 02:01:20,089
but we can't know we don't know

2012
02:01:20,089 --> 02:01:22,913
whether the salt is in within

2013
02:01:22,913 --> 02:01:24,555
the file okay so what we are

2014
02:01:24,555 --> 02:01:25,536
going to do is like we

2015
02:01:25,536 --> 02:01:27,319
are using this search button which

2016
02:01:27,319 --> 02:01:30,844
you can see on the top right

2017
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:34,063
top right and you can search

2018
02:01:34,063 --> 02:01:38,087
here salt okay so if you are using yeah

2019
02:01:38,087 --> 02:01:40,470
and then press enter then it

2020
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:45,235
will oh okay but the first

2021
02:01:45,235 --> 02:01:46,637
time when you search for the

2022
02:01:46,637 --> 02:01:49,660
files i mean content of a

2023
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:51,302
file it's indexed a little bit

2024
02:01:51,302 --> 02:01:53,404
so you could also search on

2025
02:01:53,404 --> 02:01:55,747
the original repo if you want yes

2026
02:01:55,747 --> 02:01:58,350
yeah i will do that too

2027
02:02:05,553 --> 02:02:06,255
Let me go there.

2028
02:02:09,305 --> 02:02:11,351
So this is the original repo.

2029
02:02:11,351 --> 02:02:11,793
Yeah.

2030
02:02:13,237 --> 02:02:14,642
This is the original repo.

2031
02:02:14,642 --> 02:02:15,404
Okay.

2032
02:02:15,404 --> 02:02:16,909
So basically now what I'm going

2033
02:02:16,909 --> 02:02:18,313
to do is like I'm searching here.

2034
02:02:21,382 --> 02:02:23,367
So now you can see wherever

2035
02:02:23,367 --> 02:02:25,191
the salt is mentioned, you can

2036
02:02:25,993 --> 02:02:28,499
see all the files.

2037
02:02:28,499 --> 02:02:29,602
So for suppose it is in

2038
02:02:29,602 --> 02:02:34,334
the salts backslash mixit.md, and

2039
02:02:34,334 --> 02:02:38,223
then it is also in the deserts.

2040
02:02:38,223 --> 02:02:41,068
And then it is also in the guacamole

2041
02:02:41,068 --> 02:02:42,650
and in this Andhra salad

2042
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:45,835
and the mushroom soup, pumpkin

2043
02:02:45,835 --> 02:02:47,979
pipe, and then Andhra mango

2044
02:02:47,979 --> 02:02:50,984
pickle and vegetarian lasagna.

2045
02:02:50,984 --> 02:02:51,344
Okay.

2046
02:02:51,344 --> 02:02:52,286
So basically it's like if

2047
02:02:52,286 --> 02:02:53,668
you want to search for this

2048
02:02:53,668 --> 02:02:56,773
salt, you use this search button,

2049
02:02:56,773 --> 02:02:57,915
which was on the top.

2050
02:02:57,915 --> 02:02:58,155
Okay.

2051
02:02:59,317 --> 02:03:00,438
Okay.

2052
02:03:00,438 --> 02:03:01,900
Now I will go back to the,

2053
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:04,764
I can read the, I can read the question.

2054
02:03:04,764 --> 02:03:06,626
The sixth one is that

2055
02:03:06,626 --> 02:03:08,228
in the Gokumala recipe, find

2056
02:03:08,228 --> 02:03:11,372
out who modified each line last and when.

2057
02:03:11,372 --> 02:03:11,472
Okay.

2058
02:03:13,334 --> 02:03:14,596
So let's go to the

2059
02:03:14,596 --> 02:03:16,598
Gokumala recipe, which is in the sites.

2060
02:03:19,582 --> 02:03:22,766
So the question is who modified last?

2061
02:03:22,766 --> 02:03:23,046
Yes.

2062
02:03:24,005 --> 02:03:26,910
So it's actually the blame they're asking.

2063
02:03:26,910 --> 02:03:28,433
Yeah, OK, yeah.

2064
02:03:29,475 --> 02:03:32,540
So to see, you can click on the file, OK?

2065
02:03:33,401 --> 02:03:34,623
And when you click on the

2066
02:03:34,623 --> 02:03:38,610
file, you should see, where is this blame?

2067
02:03:40,153 --> 02:03:42,016
Yeah, OK.

2068
02:03:42,016 --> 02:03:44,140
I need to zoom a bit.

2069
02:03:52,574 --> 02:03:53,915
Yeah, so another way to do

2070
02:03:53,915 --> 02:03:55,797
that is, [name], is that if you

2071
02:03:55,797 --> 02:03:57,218
go back to the file.

2072
02:03:57,218 --> 02:03:57,398
Yeah.

2073
02:03:59,761 --> 02:04:02,243
So that is what the

2074
02:04:02,243 --> 02:04:06,547
answer for the recommended answer

2075
02:04:06,547 --> 02:04:07,788
is that you go back to the

2076
02:04:07,788 --> 02:04:09,029
file and click on blame, yes.

2077
02:04:09,029 --> 02:04:09,449
Yes, yes.

2078
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:12,933
So yeah, I went back to the file.

2079
02:04:12,933 --> 02:04:15,175
OK, and let me do it again.

2080
02:04:17,697 --> 02:04:18,818
So here is the file.

2081
02:04:18,818 --> 02:04:19,979
You click on this file.

2082
02:04:19,979 --> 02:04:22,783
Then you can see here, right

2083
02:04:22,783 --> 02:04:24,725
now you are in the preview mode,

2084
02:04:24,725 --> 02:04:26,127
so you need to now go to the blame.

2085
02:04:27,769 --> 02:04:28,750
When you click on the blame,

2086
02:04:28,750 --> 02:04:31,694
you can see when the file was modified

2087
02:04:31,694 --> 02:04:35,299
and you can see who added

2088
02:04:35,299 --> 02:04:37,021
this line or who changed this

2089
02:04:37,021 --> 02:04:40,506
line by clicking on this blame.

2090
02:04:40,506 --> 02:04:44,451
This is the three rectangles.

2091
02:04:46,405 --> 02:04:47,733
So when you click on it,

2092
02:04:47,733 --> 02:04:52,919
you can see who has changed this.

2093
02:04:52,919 --> 02:04:55,864
So the question number seven

2094
02:04:55,864 --> 02:04:57,306
is more about, you know, are

2095
02:04:57,306 --> 02:04:58,488
we allowed to use it?

2096
02:04:58,488 --> 02:05:00,672
It's talking about some license.

2097
02:05:00,672 --> 02:05:02,014
Okay.

2098
02:05:02,014 --> 02:05:04,699
So it would be in the report.

2099
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:06,762
Do you have anything to

2100
02:05:06,762 --> 02:05:08,345
mention about license?

2101
02:05:08,345 --> 02:05:10,708
So here, yeah, it's like

2102
02:05:10,708 --> 02:05:12,932
they basically when I clone the

2103
02:05:12,932 --> 02:05:15,036
repo, there is a license

2104
02:05:15,036 --> 02:05:16,839
associated to it, which is

2105
02:05:16,839 --> 02:05:19,463
like a creative common license 1.0.

2106
02:05:19,463 --> 02:05:22,507
so it's like either you can

2107
02:05:22,507 --> 02:05:27,153
see on the main page like with this license

2108
02:05:27,153 --> 02:05:31,218
or else what is more nice is like

2109
02:05:31,218 --> 02:05:31,959
when you click on this

2110
02:05:31,959 --> 02:05:34,382
license basically you can look

2111
02:05:34,382 --> 02:05:37,265
see all this what are the permissions

2112
02:05:37,265 --> 02:05:38,387
and how can you use

2113
02:05:38,387 --> 02:05:40,489
this permissions okay so that's

2114
02:05:40,489 --> 02:05:42,512
very later on in this course

2115
02:05:42,512 --> 02:05:45,416
so yeah no more but this

2116
02:05:45,416 --> 02:05:46,637
this basically tells you what

2117
02:05:46,637 --> 02:05:47,358
you are allowed to do and

2118
02:05:47,358 --> 02:05:49,552
what you are not allowed yeah

2119
02:05:49,552 --> 02:05:50,874
So what kind of license

2120
02:05:50,874 --> 02:05:52,055
do you use normally?

2121
02:05:53,137 --> 02:05:55,540
It's like a Creative Commons.

2122
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:57,823
Creative Commons or MIT for code.

2123
02:05:57,823 --> 02:06:01,047
So GNU public license.

2124
02:06:01,047 --> 02:06:03,350
Mostly open source copyright.

2125
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:06,053
Yeah, because now if the

2126
02:06:06,053 --> 02:06:08,697
funding agencies are now pushing

2127
02:06:08,697 --> 02:06:12,562
towards the fair, like sharing the code fair.

2128
02:06:12,562 --> 02:06:15,986
So it's important to have a license.

2129
02:06:15,986 --> 02:06:17,248
Yeah, it's really important.

2130
02:06:17,248 --> 02:06:17,817
Yeah.

2131
02:06:17,817 --> 02:06:19,299
Okay, so the last question,

2132
02:06:19,299 --> 02:06:21,963
Iman, is that it's in the main repository.

2133
02:06:22,944 --> 02:06:24,266
Is there any pull requests?

2134
02:06:25,067 --> 02:06:27,870
Okay, yeah.

2135
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:29,673
Later on, but the pull

2136
02:06:29,673 --> 02:06:31,916
request in general is that what I did was,

2137
02:06:31,916 --> 02:06:32,817
Iman, is that I did some

2138
02:06:32,817 --> 02:06:34,900
modification and I send it upstream.

2139
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:36,902
Upstream is the place where I copied.

2140
02:06:36,902 --> 02:06:39,326
Downstream is my local copy.

2141
02:06:39,326 --> 02:06:40,547
And I made some changes.

2142
02:06:40,547 --> 02:06:42,250
I asked from the authors, would

2143
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:43,912
you like to incorporate it?

2144
02:06:43,912 --> 02:06:44,632
Okay.

2145
02:06:44,632 --> 02:06:49,417
Basically, I'm now at the upstream,

2146
02:06:49,417 --> 02:06:50,939
which is where I started

2147
02:06:50,939 --> 02:06:53,582
forking my repository, which is

2148
02:06:53,582 --> 02:06:55,865
like a CR workshop exercises.

2149
02:06:55,865 --> 02:06:59,089
Then this is the main page

2150
02:06:59,089 --> 02:07:00,690
and you can see these icons,

2151
02:07:00,690 --> 02:07:02,352
issues and pull requests.

2152
02:07:02,352 --> 02:07:05,156
Now the question is about the pull request.

2153
02:07:05,156 --> 02:07:07,438
When you click this pull request,

2154
02:07:07,438 --> 02:07:09,160
what you can see is like,

2155
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,822
are there any open issues?

2156
02:07:10,822 --> 02:07:15,169
[name], you will be talking

2157
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:16,250
about it later, right?

2158
02:07:17,252 --> 02:07:19,716
Yeah, we can just talk about it now.

2159
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:21,218
If you click on that salad

2160
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:24,102
recipe, so that is a new change I propose.

2161
02:07:25,725 --> 02:07:27,067
Would you like to incorporate it?

2162
02:07:27,067 --> 02:07:27,267
Yeah.

2163
02:07:28,369 --> 02:07:29,831
If you see that the commits are there,

2164
02:07:29,831 --> 02:07:31,113
what changed, you could also

2165
02:07:31,113 --> 02:07:33,637
click and see what file was changed.

2166
02:07:33,637 --> 02:07:34,819
and what the commits were.

2167
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:40,186
And then as the owner of the repo

2168
02:07:40,186 --> 02:07:41,608
or some of the review, we

2169
02:07:41,608 --> 02:07:43,010
call it the review process, which means

2170
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:43,852
that you go through the

2171
02:07:43,852 --> 02:07:44,873
code and see whether it's

2172
02:07:44,873 --> 02:07:46,936
appropriate to be incorporated into

2173
02:07:46,936 --> 02:07:48,198
the main line of development.

2174
02:07:49,239 --> 02:07:50,081
And then you could do

2175
02:07:50,081 --> 02:07:51,763
something called merge to...

2176
02:07:53,127 --> 02:07:55,571
make it um combined to the

2177
02:07:55,571 --> 02:07:57,874
main branch yeah yeah i would

2178
02:07:57,874 --> 02:07:58,976
also like to mention a little

2179
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:01,660
bit about the the pull request

2180
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:03,022
before i send the request i

2181
02:08:03,022 --> 02:08:04,464
opened an issue him on so if

2182
02:08:04,464 --> 02:08:06,887
you click on the issue so there

2183
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:08,089
is a yeah this is what

2184
02:08:08,089 --> 02:08:10,052
right one working awaiting approval

2185
02:08:10,052 --> 02:08:11,113
this is what you are waiting

2186
02:08:11,113 --> 02:08:14,238
for yes but uh yeah so where

2187
02:08:14,238 --> 02:08:18,473
should i go uh issues issues okay yeah

2188
02:08:18,473 --> 02:08:20,135
So before I send the request,

2189
02:08:20,135 --> 02:08:20,875
I made an issue.

2190
02:08:21,976 --> 02:08:24,038
Just like anyone has a good salad.

2191
02:08:24,038 --> 02:08:26,441
So somebody asking, you know, salad.

2192
02:08:26,441 --> 02:08:28,062
And then before I send the change

2193
02:08:28,062 --> 02:08:30,264
or start working on it, I

2194
02:08:30,264 --> 02:08:31,265
opened an issue and said, you

2195
02:08:31,265 --> 02:08:34,088
know, I'm going to send a salad recipe.

2196
02:08:34,088 --> 02:08:35,389
So everybody else would know

2197
02:08:35,389 --> 02:08:36,791
that somebody is working on something.

2198
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:38,572
So we don't have to, you

2199
02:08:38,572 --> 02:08:40,234
know, do the same thing.

2200
02:08:40,234 --> 02:08:41,956
So after that, in the

2201
02:08:41,956 --> 02:08:44,438
next episode, we'll talk about,

2202
02:08:44,438 --> 02:08:45,279
you know, in the issue, it

2203
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:46,520
could be, we could record.

2204
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:49,265
what happened and it also

2205
02:08:49,265 --> 02:08:50,948
tells the public that somebody is

2206
02:08:50,948 --> 02:08:52,951
working on it so others could help

2207
02:08:52,951 --> 02:08:53,793
or not to do the same

2208
02:08:53,793 --> 02:08:56,197
thing in parallel and also

2209
02:08:56,197 --> 02:08:58,020
what has somebody done up to

2210
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:01,727
now okay and what is this sub issue

2211
02:09:03,243 --> 02:09:05,306
That is to create another issue.

2212
02:09:05,306 --> 02:09:07,209
So if you could create another issue,

2213
02:09:07,209 --> 02:09:08,611
but that's, we're not going

2214
02:09:08,611 --> 02:09:10,334
to talk today, but you could

2215
02:09:10,334 --> 02:09:12,397
create like a related issue.

2216
02:09:12,397 --> 02:09:13,959
Let's say something related to

2217
02:09:13,959 --> 02:09:15,702
this salad recipe, but somebody

2218
02:09:15,702 --> 02:09:17,465
wants to work on, I don't

2219
02:09:17,465 --> 02:09:19,688
know, maybe a topping, for example.

2220
02:09:19,688 --> 02:09:20,449
Okay.

2221
02:09:20,449 --> 02:09:20,830
So, yeah.

2222
02:09:22,075 --> 02:09:25,378
Yes, so those are the questions, [name].

2223
02:09:25,378 --> 02:09:26,499
Then now what I will do is

2224
02:09:26,499 --> 02:09:28,982
I will share the shared document

2225
02:09:28,982 --> 02:09:29,683
to see whether there are

2226
02:09:29,683 --> 02:09:30,584
any interesting questions.

2227
02:09:30,584 --> 02:09:31,044
Is that okay?

2228
02:09:31,044 --> 02:09:32,886
Okay, yeah.

2229
02:09:32,886 --> 02:09:34,387
But for everyone, you can

2230
02:09:34,387 --> 02:09:38,552
also get the solutions in the main page.

2231
02:09:38,552 --> 02:09:40,333
So if you browse down, you

2232
02:09:40,333 --> 02:09:42,355
also can see the solutions.

2233
02:09:42,355 --> 02:09:43,176
Yes.

2234
02:09:43,176 --> 02:09:44,458
Over to [name].

2235
02:09:44,458 --> 02:09:45,619
Yeah, so now I'm going to

2236
02:09:45,619 --> 02:09:47,561
share the shared document from

2237
02:09:47,561 --> 02:09:48,842
my screen share now.

2238
02:09:51,303 --> 02:09:53,826
Is this my screen, Janu?

2239
02:09:58,772 --> 02:10:02,056
It's collaborative notes, I see.

2240
02:10:02,056 --> 02:10:03,078
So currently we are showing

2241
02:10:03,078 --> 02:10:07,082
the notes, and Herman's screen

2242
02:10:07,082 --> 02:10:08,905
is still being shared.

2243
02:10:08,905 --> 02:10:09,986
Can you stop?

2244
02:10:09,986 --> 02:10:11,448
Yeah, I will stop the share.

2245
02:10:17,636 --> 02:10:18,036
Once again.

2246
02:10:22,387 --> 02:10:25,312
So in this one question is

2247
02:10:25,312 --> 02:10:26,974
that there was some configuration,

2248
02:10:26,974 --> 02:10:28,216
for example, how to do

2249
02:10:28,216 --> 02:10:30,901
this on Visual Studio Code and...

2250
02:10:30,901 --> 02:10:32,403
I stopped the share.

2251
02:10:32,403 --> 02:10:32,703
Yeah.

2252
02:10:32,703 --> 02:10:35,508
So those questions, those are

2253
02:10:35,508 --> 02:10:37,491
needed for the rest of the day.

2254
02:10:37,491 --> 02:10:38,753
And at the end of the day,

2255
02:10:39,594 --> 02:10:40,396
I will show some Git

2256
02:10:40,396 --> 02:10:42,419
configurations, some things you

2257
02:10:42,419 --> 02:10:47,210
needed for later on that you could go and...

2258
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:49,092
make sure those are working

2259
02:10:49,092 --> 02:10:51,895
before the rest of the course.

2260
02:10:51,895 --> 02:10:53,076
And the other thing is, [name], is

2261
02:10:53,076 --> 02:10:54,678
that some people have

2262
02:10:54,678 --> 02:10:56,720
mentioned about GitHub, I mean,

2263
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:58,302
Google Drive, for example, Google

2264
02:10:58,302 --> 02:10:59,703
Docs, you could have some versions.

2265
02:11:00,564 --> 02:11:02,666
And even in like a

2266
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:03,847
Microsoft ecosystem, you have

2267
02:11:03,847 --> 02:11:05,309
the Microsoft Word and also

2268
02:11:05,309 --> 02:11:07,351
the LibreOffice in the free

2269
02:11:07,351 --> 02:11:10,194
version, open source versions that

2270
02:11:10,194 --> 02:11:11,695
you have something called track changes.

2271
02:11:13,237 --> 02:11:14,839
So those also have some sort

2272
02:11:14,839 --> 02:11:16,120
of a version controlling.

2273
02:11:16,943 --> 02:11:18,444
But for the code, it's

2274
02:11:19,425 --> 02:11:21,367
not that convenient to combine things

2275
02:11:21,367 --> 02:11:23,148
and do a lot of things,

2276
02:11:23,148 --> 02:11:25,891
but there is some version control.

2277
02:11:27,232 --> 02:11:28,593
But if you try to version

2278
02:11:28,593 --> 02:11:30,155
control a Word document on

2279
02:11:30,155 --> 02:11:31,976
Git, I don't recommend it.

2280
02:11:31,976 --> 02:11:33,778
It's not going to work well.

2281
02:11:33,778 --> 02:11:35,579
Okay.

2282
02:11:35,579 --> 02:11:36,540
So then it's a plain

2283
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:38,262
text is the recommended one.

2284
02:11:38,262 --> 02:11:39,843
Is there anything else, [name],

2285
02:11:39,843 --> 02:11:42,786
you see that here that we should mention?

2286
02:11:42,786 --> 02:11:45,168
Yeah, that's, I'm trying to see this.

2287
02:11:45,168 --> 02:11:45,884
What is

2288
02:11:45,884 --> 02:11:47,346
My search for salt result

2289
02:11:47,346 --> 02:11:49,928
in this repository's code being

2290
02:11:49,928 --> 02:11:50,669
indexed right now.

2291
02:11:50,669 --> 02:11:50,889
Yeah.

2292
02:11:50,889 --> 02:11:53,452
So the indexing is that people

2293
02:11:53,452 --> 02:11:56,816
who know about databases, they know

2294
02:11:56,816 --> 02:11:58,117
that when you want to

2295
02:11:58,117 --> 02:11:59,598
search some things, you have

2296
02:11:59,598 --> 02:12:02,221
to get the keywords and create

2297
02:12:02,221 --> 02:12:03,382
some sort of index.

2298
02:12:03,382 --> 02:12:05,044
So that takes a little bit of time.

2299
02:12:05,044 --> 02:12:06,806
It will take about two

2300
02:12:06,806 --> 02:12:07,827
or three minutes maximum.

2301
02:12:08,768 --> 02:12:11,431
And then you can search the GitHub.

2302
02:12:11,431 --> 02:12:13,293
So that's a normal thing.

2303
02:12:13,293 --> 02:12:13,829
Yeah.

2304
02:12:13,829 --> 02:12:15,593
We are, I'm ready to go

2305
02:12:15,593 --> 02:12:18,017
to your screen share separate.

2306
02:12:18,017 --> 02:12:19,500
Okay, go ahead.

2307
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:20,863
All right.

2308
02:12:20,863 --> 02:12:22,867
Yeah, good.

2309
02:12:22,867 --> 02:12:23,990
And anything else, Ayman, that

2310
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:26,515
you want to mention before we move on?

2311
02:12:26,515 --> 02:12:27,396
No, nothing.

2312
02:12:27,396 --> 02:12:28,940
It's mostly they were asking

2313
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:31,585
about the license, but yeah,

2314
02:12:31,585 --> 02:12:35,395
the helpers were answering them.

2315
02:12:35,395 --> 02:12:36,116
Okay.

2316
02:12:36,116 --> 02:12:37,298
So the license is important

2317
02:12:37,298 --> 02:12:38,400
to choose like even before

2318
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,243
you commit your first piece

2319
02:12:40,243 --> 02:12:41,886
of code, it's better that you

2320
02:12:41,886 --> 02:12:42,827
create a license and in

2321
02:12:42,827 --> 02:12:46,413
the upcoming, between the same

2322
02:12:46,413 --> 02:12:47,936
course upcoming lessons, we'll talk

2323
02:12:47,936 --> 02:12:50,781
a little bit about licensing.

2324
02:12:51,642 --> 02:12:53,124
So now what we do is,

2325
02:12:53,124 --> 02:12:54,887
Iman, that I will introduce the

2326
02:12:54,887 --> 02:12:56,670
next lesson a little bit before

2327
02:12:56,670 --> 02:13:00,657
we go to a break, which is the longer break.

2328
02:13:00,657 --> 02:13:03,020
okay um so we have done

2329
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:04,543
now the browsing part and

2330
02:13:04,543 --> 02:13:06,466
then the committing part so

2331
02:13:06,466 --> 02:13:08,408
what does committing means uh to

2332
02:13:08,408 --> 02:13:10,632
you um hey man and there

2333
02:13:10,632 --> 02:13:12,615
is this interchangeable word which

2334
02:13:12,615 --> 02:13:14,517
is used uh commit and record

2335
02:13:14,517 --> 02:13:16,160
a little bit in this lessons

2336
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,201
do you have any comment about

2337
02:13:17,201 --> 02:13:21,147
this uh it's like uh basically

2338
02:13:22,882 --> 02:13:27,106
I create some changes and I want to like,

2339
02:13:27,106 --> 02:13:29,369
uh, basically right now we

2340
02:13:29,369 --> 02:13:31,231
created some salads, right?

2341
02:13:31,231 --> 02:13:32,912
Like a guacamole salad and

2342
02:13:32,912 --> 02:13:34,654
trying to add new salads.

2343
02:13:34,654 --> 02:13:35,936
And now I want to push

2344
02:13:35,936 --> 02:13:37,597
this to the upstream.

2345
02:13:37,597 --> 02:13:39,319
So this is what, uh, I

2346
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:40,981
mean, uh, I think the commit means,

2347
02:13:42,242 --> 02:13:43,744
or I want to record these changes.

2348
02:13:44,905 --> 02:13:45,445
Is that right?

2349
02:13:46,306 --> 02:13:48,469
Um, that's kind of right.

2350
02:13:48,469 --> 02:13:50,110
But the technical word for that

2351
02:13:50,110 --> 02:13:51,532
is we call it push.

2352
02:13:51,532 --> 02:13:52,244
Yeah.

2353
02:13:52,244 --> 02:13:54,648
So the commit in Git and

2354
02:13:54,648 --> 02:13:57,113
the recording is interchangeably used.

2355
02:13:57,113 --> 02:13:59,777
In the Git technology, if you

2356
02:13:59,777 --> 02:14:01,020
sort of dig a little bit, I

2357
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:04,305
don't want to kind of go

2358
02:14:04,305 --> 02:14:05,427
deep into technical details, but

2359
02:14:06,589 --> 02:14:09,254
when we look at the terminal,

2360
02:14:09,254 --> 02:14:10,256
you will see there's something

2361
02:14:10,256 --> 02:14:13,221
called a .git folder, which tracks

2362
02:14:13,221 --> 02:14:14,784
all of these snapshots.

2363
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,645
There's a place where the

2364
02:14:15,645 --> 02:14:17,152
snapshots are kept.

2365
02:14:17,152 --> 02:14:18,914
So it's a timestamp.

2366
02:14:18,914 --> 02:14:19,936
Yeah, with the timestamp and

2367
02:14:19,936 --> 02:14:21,437
everything and also the metadata,

2368
02:14:21,437 --> 02:14:22,359
it's kept somewhere.

2369
02:14:22,359 --> 02:14:23,460
Even in the cloud, there

2370
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:25,843
is .git folder where it's like

2371
02:14:25,843 --> 02:14:27,225
a database of all these changes.

2372
02:14:28,066 --> 02:14:31,670
So the changes I kept in a way as diffs.

2373
02:14:31,670 --> 02:14:32,832
Diff is like a difference

2374
02:14:32,832 --> 02:14:35,595
between what was last and what was now.

2375
02:14:35,595 --> 02:14:38,379
So it doesn't keep copies of each snapshot,

2376
02:14:38,379 --> 02:14:39,921
but instead it keeps the

2377
02:14:39,921 --> 02:14:41,623
difference between the parent.

2378
02:14:42,869 --> 02:14:45,594
So in this sense, in

2379
02:14:45,594 --> 02:14:47,657
the browser, it's difficult to show this.

2380
02:14:48,699 --> 02:14:52,025
So the Git works in a two-step process.

2381
02:14:52,025 --> 02:14:53,747
You have to add and

2382
02:14:53,747 --> 02:14:54,849
commit, which means that you

2383
02:14:54,849 --> 02:14:56,272
have to suggest that you're

2384
02:14:56,272 --> 02:14:58,310
going to add something and then

2385
02:14:58,310 --> 02:15:00,673
permanent make it permanent so

2386
02:15:00,673 --> 02:15:03,616
as soon as you suggest to git

2387
02:15:03,616 --> 02:15:05,439
that you know i want

2388
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:06,840
version control this it's actually

2389
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,944
get recorded but in a subsequent

2390
02:15:09,944 --> 02:15:12,086
step it also incorporates the

2391
02:15:13,328 --> 02:15:15,711
metadata like timestamp and everything

2392
02:15:15,711 --> 02:15:16,952
and then it creates a

2393
02:15:16,952 --> 02:15:18,995
message log message and it make

2394
02:15:18,995 --> 02:15:23,892
it permanent so in this sense in this

2395
02:15:23,892 --> 02:15:25,253
lesson, what we're going to

2396
02:15:25,253 --> 02:15:27,376
talk about is how to make

2397
02:15:27,376 --> 02:15:29,958
a change permanently recorded in

2398
02:15:29,958 --> 02:15:31,960
a snapshot on your local copy.

2399
02:15:32,981 --> 02:15:34,042
Then we come to what you

2400
02:15:34,042 --> 02:15:36,545
said later on tomorrow, you

2401
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:38,647
make permanent in your copy, and

2402
02:15:38,647 --> 02:15:40,829
then you send that change

2403
02:15:40,829 --> 02:15:42,211
upstream, which is the place you

2404
02:15:42,211 --> 02:15:44,293
copied it from to incorporate.

2405
02:15:44,293 --> 02:15:45,314
We call that the push.

2406
02:15:45,314 --> 02:15:46,615
So those are the two

2407
02:15:46,615 --> 02:15:48,477
concepts that we're going to talk about.

2408
02:15:48,477 --> 02:15:49,438
But now we're going to talk

2409
02:15:49,438 --> 02:15:50,819
about only on the local copy

2410
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:53,980
and then how to make that

2411
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:56,904
Here we have a

2412
02:15:56,904 --> 02:15:59,927
different terminology background that

2413
02:15:59,927 --> 02:16:00,789
we are going to talk about.

2414
02:16:00,789 --> 02:16:02,511
Repository is where all these

2415
02:16:02,511 --> 02:16:04,133
files are all together.

2416
02:16:04,133 --> 02:16:07,136
And commit is, we know

2417
02:16:07,136 --> 02:16:08,959
that that's a snapshot, which is

2418
02:16:08,959 --> 02:16:11,983
the status of that, the set

2419
02:16:11,983 --> 02:16:14,426
of files with some metadata.

2420
02:16:14,426 --> 02:16:15,727
And when you have a

2421
02:16:15,727 --> 02:16:18,431
snapshot entire project in time,

2422
02:16:18,431 --> 02:16:20,930
like that we also had a look.

2423
02:16:20,930 --> 02:16:22,432
and a branch, we had

2424
02:16:22,432 --> 02:16:25,436
to try different things.

2425
02:16:25,436 --> 02:16:27,819
Then you could combine them later on.

2426
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:30,943
And then this one, I would

2427
02:16:30,943 --> 02:16:32,425
like to hold on for a

2428
02:16:32,425 --> 02:16:35,669
moment about the reference to

2429
02:16:35,669 --> 02:16:37,471
like a sticky note, because

2430
02:16:37,471 --> 02:16:39,453
we need some context to understand that.

2431
02:16:39,453 --> 02:16:40,695
And then we have tags,

2432
02:16:40,695 --> 02:16:42,517
which are like sticky notes that

2433
02:16:42,517 --> 02:16:44,139
you stick to someplace, but it doesn't move.

2434
02:16:45,141 --> 02:16:47,764
A commit is also like that, but it moves.

2435
02:16:49,263 --> 02:16:50,825
So in this sense, in

2436
02:16:50,825 --> 02:16:53,448
order to understand all this, the best way,

2437
02:16:53,448 --> 02:16:55,450
[name], is that I can show us

2438
02:16:55,450 --> 02:16:56,892
how to do it a little bit.

2439
02:16:57,773 --> 02:16:58,494
Okay.

2440
02:16:59,295 --> 02:17:01,397
We will not talk about the exercise now.

2441
02:17:01,397 --> 02:17:02,438
I mean, exercise we will

2442
02:17:02,438 --> 02:17:03,980
talk about after the lunch.

2443
02:17:04,981 --> 02:17:06,263
But we will get some

2444
02:17:06,263 --> 02:17:08,045
context within the next four

2445
02:17:08,045 --> 02:17:09,507
or five minutes that what we need.

2446
02:17:11,329 --> 02:17:14,710
So if you remember that the...

2447
02:17:14,710 --> 02:17:18,824
the browsing lesson you used a repository.

2448
02:17:18,824 --> 02:17:20,029
Yes.

2449
02:17:20,029 --> 02:17:22,598
Which is called the recorded version.

2450
02:17:22,598 --> 02:17:24,304
So, in that recorded version I

2451
02:17:24,304 --> 02:17:25,347
am going to right click and

2452
02:17:25,347 --> 02:17:26,391
open it in another tab.

2453
02:17:29,307 --> 02:17:32,351
And for the users, they go to their own.

2454
02:17:32,351 --> 02:17:34,695
So right now it is only the demo, right?

2455
02:17:34,695 --> 02:17:35,015
Yes.

2456
02:17:35,015 --> 02:17:37,819
So I'm going to show some concepts here,

2457
02:17:37,819 --> 02:17:39,862
but describing the text, but

2458
02:17:39,862 --> 02:17:41,925
I'm going to show it on the GitHub itself.

2459
02:17:42,866 --> 02:17:43,567
Here, as you see that

2460
02:17:43,567 --> 02:17:44,849
there are three defaults, but

2461
02:17:44,849 --> 02:17:47,032
don't fork from this because if

2462
02:17:47,032 --> 02:17:48,434
you fork it, people will see

2463
02:17:48,434 --> 02:17:50,657
your username in the video.

2464
02:17:50,657 --> 02:17:52,219
So please try to use

2465
02:17:52,219 --> 02:17:54,742
the version without the recorder,

2466
02:17:54,742 --> 02:17:57,286
but the same, you could do the same things.

2467
02:17:57,286 --> 02:17:58,608
So if you see the fork here,

2468
02:17:58,608 --> 02:17:59,830
I see that I have a fork here.

2469
02:18:03,915 --> 02:18:05,678
So the idea is to add

2470
02:18:05,678 --> 02:18:07,941
something in this, some contribution

2471
02:18:07,941 --> 02:18:09,243
that I have to make.

2472
02:18:09,243 --> 02:18:10,044
So in order to make

2473
02:18:10,044 --> 02:18:12,087
the contribution, the idea is

2474
02:18:12,087 --> 02:18:14,630
that I will create a branch,

2475
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:18,025
as that sunglass branch and the hat branch.

2476
02:18:18,025 --> 02:18:19,768
Then I could mention that my

2477
02:18:19,768 --> 02:18:22,653
name to be more explanatory,

2478
02:18:23,955 --> 02:18:26,980
new recipe, because I'm not

2479
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:29,544
sure what I'm going to suggest yet.

2480
02:18:30,426 --> 02:18:32,509
Then when you type something, a

2481
02:18:32,509 --> 02:18:34,012
name of a branch, if it

2482
02:18:34,012 --> 02:18:35,915
is not already there, it will

2483
02:18:35,915 --> 02:18:37,317
suggest to create it.

2484
02:18:39,254 --> 02:18:40,556
So if somebody asks you to

2485
02:18:40,556 --> 02:18:41,877
create a branch and if you're

2486
02:18:41,877 --> 02:18:44,941
working on the web browser itself, you see

2487
02:18:44,941 --> 02:18:46,643
that this is a recipe branch

2488
02:18:46,643 --> 02:18:47,624
and you also have the main

2489
02:18:47,624 --> 02:18:48,925
branch, but now you see the

2490
02:18:48,925 --> 02:18:50,027
branch that I created.

2491
02:18:51,749 --> 02:18:55,794
So in that branch, what I could do is

2492
02:18:55,794 --> 02:18:57,756
if I want to contribute something,

2493
02:18:57,756 --> 02:19:01,300
for example, I don't know,

2494
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:04,144
a soup, for example, I'll go

2495
02:19:04,144 --> 02:19:08,633
to that place and then I could

2496
02:19:08,633 --> 02:19:11,078
you know, create a file.

2497
02:19:11,078 --> 02:19:13,603
So when, what we do after lunch is

2498
02:19:13,603 --> 02:19:17,130
that we will see how to,

2499
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:19,194
you know, I created a branch now,

2500
02:19:19,194 --> 02:19:21,238
so you could also, you know,

2501
02:19:21,238 --> 02:19:22,380
try to create now, but you

2502
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:25,087
know, now we'll have a break very soon.

2503
02:19:25,087 --> 02:19:28,611
After that, I will show how

2504
02:19:28,611 --> 02:19:30,413
to make a contribution onto the

2505
02:19:30,413 --> 02:19:31,934
local copy of your copy.

2506
02:19:31,934 --> 02:19:34,197
As you can see from the top here, [name],

2507
02:19:34,197 --> 02:19:35,698
I'm working on my copy, the

2508
02:19:35,698 --> 02:19:37,941
[name]-recipes, not on the main,

2509
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:39,022
the place I copied.

2510
02:19:40,023 --> 02:19:42,966
And then I will try to

2511
02:19:42,966 --> 02:19:45,248
make my changes there.

2512
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:49,713
Now what we'll do is that,

2513
02:19:49,713 --> 02:19:51,735
now we'll break for the lunch now.

2514
02:19:53,318 --> 02:19:54,820
And those things I mentioned,

2515
02:19:54,820 --> 02:19:56,482
I will show them again.

2516
02:19:56,482 --> 02:19:59,005
So we will come back to this.

2517
02:19:59,005 --> 02:20:01,848
So the line is one hour.

2518
02:20:01,848 --> 02:20:05,893
And then we will indicate that time,

2519
02:20:05,893 --> 02:20:07,194
you know, we are to convert

2520
02:20:07,194 --> 02:20:08,936
it according to your time.

2521
02:20:08,936 --> 02:20:09,958
Local time.

2522
02:20:09,958 --> 02:20:11,480
Local time, yes.

2523
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:12,661
And it's very important that

2524
02:20:12,661 --> 02:20:14,503
you come back at one.

2525
02:20:15,364 --> 02:20:17,346
I would say bye for now

2526
02:20:17,346 --> 02:20:18,668
and we'll see after lunch.

2527
03:20:12,702 --> 03:20:14,304
Hello, welcome back.

2528
03:20:16,087 --> 03:20:17,388
Did you have a good lunch break, [name]?

2529
03:20:18,510 --> 03:20:20,713
Yeah, yeah, I had a nice lunch.

2530
03:20:20,713 --> 03:20:21,253
How about you?

2531
03:20:22,295 --> 03:20:25,399
Yes, I had a smaller lunch.

2532
03:20:25,399 --> 03:20:27,882
I don't want to fall asleep while teaching.

2533
03:20:27,882 --> 03:20:29,725
That wouldn't be nice, isn't it?

2534
03:20:29,725 --> 03:20:31,527
Yes, yes.

2535
03:20:31,527 --> 03:20:34,151
So before we start, [name],

2536
03:20:34,151 --> 03:20:35,132
there's this question about

2537
03:20:35,132 --> 03:20:38,216
whether the learners need to

2538
03:20:38,216 --> 03:20:39,438
keep the solutions.

2539
03:20:39,438 --> 03:20:41,601
So the solutions are needed if

2540
03:20:41,601 --> 03:20:42,942
they want a certificate.

2541
03:20:42,942 --> 03:20:45,364
So the certificate must probably

2542
03:20:45,364 --> 03:20:46,566
be able to be converted

2543
03:20:46,566 --> 03:20:50,369
into one European credit.

2544
03:20:50,369 --> 03:20:52,492
And the details are here in

2545
03:20:52,492 --> 03:20:56,335
this link for question 39.

2546
03:20:56,335 --> 03:20:57,737
And you can go through them

2547
03:20:57,737 --> 03:21:03,523
and then ask back if that's not clear enough.

2548
03:21:03,523 --> 03:21:03,883
Okay.

2549
03:21:05,004 --> 03:21:06,305
Is there anything, any other

2550
03:21:06,305 --> 03:21:07,186
question that we need to

2551
03:21:07,186 --> 03:21:09,470
check before we proceed on?

2552
03:21:09,470 --> 03:21:13,079
I think this is the key

2553
03:21:13,079 --> 03:21:15,504
question apart from this because now

2554
03:21:15,504 --> 03:21:18,251
since we are moving to exercise two,

2555
03:21:18,251 --> 03:21:20,055
so the students have to

2556
03:21:20,055 --> 03:21:22,020
submit the exercise to like in

2557
03:21:22,020 --> 03:21:23,463
order to get the one ECTS.

2558
03:21:24,405 --> 03:21:25,929
But apart from that, nothing

2559
03:21:25,929 --> 03:21:27,613
else is seems important.

2560
03:21:28,454 --> 03:21:31,837
Uh, so then we move to the next lesson,

2561
03:21:31,837 --> 03:21:33,799
uh, the committing, if you remember

2562
03:21:33,799 --> 03:21:36,182
before the lunch break, I went to the,

2563
03:21:36,182 --> 03:21:37,843
I went to the committee lesson

2564
03:21:37,843 --> 03:21:39,105
and I just show you a little

2565
03:21:39,105 --> 03:21:41,247
bit and I went and create a fork.

2566
03:21:41,247 --> 03:21:43,149
So the fork would be ready,

2567
03:21:43,149 --> 03:21:44,811
you know, just in case if it takes time.

2568
03:21:46,032 --> 03:21:49,575
Um, and then, um, in this

2569
03:21:49,575 --> 03:21:55,221
lesson, um, what we did was that, um, um,

2570
03:21:56,956 --> 03:21:59,824
to another local copy of the copy

2571
03:21:59,824 --> 03:22:04,016
that we made from the forking exercise

2572
03:22:04,016 --> 03:22:05,179
that we were trying to

2573
03:22:07,265 --> 03:22:11,114
contribute something from our side, right?

2574
03:22:11,114 --> 03:22:14,980
And then what we did was that I clicked,

2575
03:22:14,980 --> 03:22:16,662
I went to the recipe and make sure

2576
03:22:16,662 --> 03:22:21,389
that it's your, the recipe of your,

2577
03:22:21,389 --> 03:22:22,271
I mean, the copy of

2578
03:22:22,271 --> 03:22:25,015
the repository, that's what we

2579
03:22:25,015 --> 03:22:27,378
call the fork, that you are here.

2580
03:22:27,378 --> 03:22:28,660
And then I went, I clicked

2581
03:22:28,660 --> 03:22:31,364
on this place where it says

2582
03:22:31,364 --> 03:22:32,867
main, the branch, you know,

2583
03:22:32,867 --> 03:22:34,709
the branch symbol and the main.

2584
03:22:34,709 --> 03:22:37,173
And I went there and I typed

2585
03:22:37,173 --> 03:22:39,076
a name of a branch.

2586
03:22:39,076 --> 03:22:40,864
so that branch was not there

2587
03:22:40,864 --> 03:22:43,174
so gitlab said you know do

2588
03:22:43,174 --> 03:22:45,846
you want to create that so i created that branch

2589
03:22:47,024 --> 03:22:49,848
Now I switch to that branch.

2590
03:22:49,848 --> 03:22:51,611
So when you're creating a

2591
03:22:51,611 --> 03:22:57,339
branch, this will be more important during the,

2592
03:22:57,339 --> 03:22:59,162
when we go on the terminal

2593
03:22:59,162 --> 03:23:01,886
on the Visual Studio or any other IDE as well.

2594
03:23:01,886 --> 03:23:03,709
Just creating the branch is not enough.

2595
03:23:03,709 --> 03:23:05,051
You have to switch to that.

2596
03:23:05,051 --> 03:23:06,513
Otherwise, you will be creating

2597
03:23:06,513 --> 03:23:07,515
a branch, but you will be

2598
03:23:07,515 --> 03:23:08,857
working on the main branch.

2599
03:23:08,857 --> 03:23:11,100
So you have to do the switching first.

2600
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:12,622
So here you have switched.

2601
03:23:12,622 --> 03:23:13,720
What was that?

2602
03:23:13,720 --> 03:23:14,701
How do you do that?

2603
03:23:14,701 --> 03:23:16,043
How do you do the switching?

2604
03:23:16,043 --> 03:23:17,725
Yeah, switching means I went

2605
03:23:17,725 --> 03:23:19,167
there and I selected that branch.

2606
03:23:20,168 --> 03:23:21,290
So now I'm here.

2607
03:23:21,290 --> 03:23:23,212
If I select main, now I'm

2608
03:23:23,212 --> 03:23:23,893
in the main branch.

2609
03:23:25,154 --> 03:23:26,296
Although I had created a

2610
03:23:26,296 --> 03:23:27,978
branch for myself, I'm still

2611
03:23:27,978 --> 03:23:28,759
in the main branch.

2612
03:23:28,759 --> 03:23:31,623
So I had to explicitly switch to that.

2613
03:23:32,584 --> 03:23:34,746
So then I need to

2614
03:23:34,746 --> 03:23:39,252
contribute something to the recipe.

2615
03:23:39,252 --> 03:23:43,137
Let me see if there's anything already.

2616
03:23:44,551 --> 03:23:48,309
available for me to paste in.

2617
03:23:48,309 --> 03:23:50,812
So then,

2618
03:23:50,812 --> 03:23:52,355
There's another thing that

2619
03:23:52,355 --> 03:23:53,797
important thing about this is

2620
03:23:53,797 --> 03:23:55,940
that there's a small check when

2621
03:23:55,940 --> 03:23:58,064
you submit a recipe.

2622
03:23:58,064 --> 03:24:01,289
So a check means that usually

2623
03:24:01,289 --> 03:24:02,711
if it's a code, you have

2624
03:24:02,711 --> 03:24:04,074
to make sure some basic tests

2625
03:24:04,074 --> 03:24:05,436
are passed before you integrate

2626
03:24:05,436 --> 03:24:08,521
into the main line of development.

2627
03:24:08,521 --> 03:24:10,504
So excuse me a little bit.

2628
03:24:10,504 --> 03:24:12,567
I'm going to show something

2629
03:24:12,567 --> 03:24:13,629
further down the page.

2630
03:24:13,629 --> 03:24:14,811
So I'm going to scroll down.

2631
03:24:16,529 --> 03:24:17,690
and show you that there

2632
03:24:17,690 --> 03:24:18,851
are basic things you need.

2633
03:24:18,851 --> 03:24:20,333
So there should be a title

2634
03:24:20,333 --> 03:24:22,635
for the name of the recipe,

2635
03:24:22,635 --> 03:24:23,456
and then you should have

2636
03:24:23,456 --> 03:24:25,898
some ingredients and instructions.

2637
03:24:25,898 --> 03:24:27,199
So these things are needed.

2638
03:24:28,480 --> 03:24:31,203
If this is missing, the test would fail.

2639
03:24:31,203 --> 03:24:31,824
It would say that you

2640
03:24:31,824 --> 03:24:32,784
don't have instructions.

2641
03:24:32,784 --> 03:24:33,445
So it has to be in

2642
03:24:33,445 --> 03:24:36,388
the same spellings, for example.

2643
03:24:36,388 --> 03:24:37,609
So to make sure that

2644
03:24:37,609 --> 03:24:39,731
my first commit doesn't fail, I'm

2645
03:24:39,731 --> 03:24:41,433
going to copy this and I'm

2646
03:24:41,433 --> 03:24:42,874
slowly going to move up again

2647
03:24:44,288 --> 03:24:45,750
And then I'm going back to

2648
03:24:45,750 --> 03:24:48,633
the other tab, which is the copy

2649
03:24:48,633 --> 03:24:49,675
of the, or the fork.

2650
03:24:50,676 --> 03:24:57,064
And then I want to create

2651
03:24:59,306 --> 03:25:00,828
like a contribute something.

2652
03:25:00,828 --> 03:25:02,630
So here I'm going to contribute a soup.

2653
03:25:02,630 --> 03:25:03,752
So I'm going to that folder.

2654
03:25:07,076 --> 03:25:08,978
So we have a mushroom soup already.

2655
03:25:08,978 --> 03:25:11,558
So again, I'm making sure that

2656
03:25:11,558 --> 03:25:17,285
I'm in the correct repository here.

2657
03:25:17,285 --> 03:25:19,528
So here it says that I

2658
03:25:19,528 --> 03:25:23,873
have copied from the place that

2659
03:25:23,873 --> 03:25:25,515
we forked from, but I had to

2660
03:25:25,515 --> 03:25:27,378
make sure that I'm in my place.

2661
03:25:27,378 --> 03:25:29,180
And then what I will do

2662
03:25:29,180 --> 03:25:31,483
is that I would click on this.

2663
03:25:31,483 --> 03:25:34,046
If you see this button, it says add file.

2664
03:25:34,046 --> 03:25:35,208
Do you see this, [name]?

2665
03:25:35,208 --> 03:25:36,149
Yeah, I see that.

2666
03:25:36,149 --> 03:25:36,449
Yeah.

2667
03:25:36,449 --> 03:25:38,832
So then I would say create a file.

2668
03:25:41,393 --> 03:25:44,417
So in the creator file place, I'm going to,

2669
03:25:44,417 --> 03:25:48,842
you know, some recipe for the

2670
03:25:48,842 --> 03:25:51,185
sake of like showing the Git,

2671
03:25:51,185 --> 03:25:53,488
you know, not to show my recipe skills.

2672
03:25:53,488 --> 03:25:56,532
I'm going to copy something from the web.

2673
03:25:56,532 --> 03:26:06,625
So that's a simple and creamy carrot soup.

2674
03:26:08,663 --> 03:26:09,124
Right.

2675
03:26:09,124 --> 03:26:12,689
So get this characters

2676
03:26:12,689 --> 03:26:15,353
correct, period, simple and,

2677
03:26:15,353 --> 03:26:16,695
you know, correct.

2678
03:26:16,695 --> 03:26:18,818
So should I increase the font

2679
03:26:18,818 --> 03:26:19,620
a little bit, maybe?

2680
03:26:19,620 --> 03:26:21,142
Yeah, I think it's better to increase.

2681
03:26:23,546 --> 03:26:23,666
Yeah.

2682
03:26:23,666 --> 03:26:24,427
How is it now?

2683
03:26:24,427 --> 03:26:25,108
Yeah, it's good.

2684
03:26:25,108 --> 03:26:25,649
Yes.

2685
03:26:25,649 --> 03:26:26,991
So then I need the ingredients.

2686
03:26:28,012 --> 03:26:29,354
I'm going to cheat a little bit.

2687
03:26:29,354 --> 03:26:30,837
So I'm going to copy the ingredients now.

2688
03:26:32,319 --> 03:26:32,499
Right.

2689
03:26:32,499 --> 03:26:33,781
So they are this this ingredients.

2690
03:26:35,163 --> 03:26:36,325
And then the instructions.

2691
03:26:38,178 --> 03:26:39,601
Uh, instructions also, I'm going

2692
03:26:39,601 --> 03:26:40,983
to copy it.

2693
03:26:40,983 --> 03:26:42,707
Yeah.

2694
03:26:42,707 --> 03:26:46,474
So this is the content of my, um, file.

2695
03:26:46,474 --> 03:26:47,516
So I'm going to go

2696
03:26:47,516 --> 03:26:52,626
size, write something like, um, tasty soup.

2697
03:26:53,669 --> 03:26:55,092
then you need a file name here

2698
03:26:55,092 --> 03:26:58,899
so the file name I would say

2699
03:26:58,899 --> 03:27:02,706
that this is a markdown file

2700
03:27:02,706 --> 03:27:04,730
so that is the document I'm going

2701
03:27:04,730 --> 03:27:06,733
to it could be a text file for example

2702
03:27:06,733 --> 03:27:08,136
but as we discussed before the

2703
03:27:08,136 --> 03:27:09,418
git we don't version control

2704
03:27:10,480 --> 03:27:12,404
like you know complex document

2705
03:27:12,404 --> 03:27:14,648
types like pdfs and docs and all

2706
03:27:15,556 --> 03:27:16,778
I'm going to call it MD

2707
03:27:17,679 --> 03:27:19,141
to indicate that it's a markdown.

2708
03:27:19,141 --> 03:27:21,424
When you indicate that the file type,

2709
03:27:21,424 --> 03:27:23,968
for example, Python, C, Git

2710
03:27:23,968 --> 03:27:26,031
actually try to interpret that file

2711
03:27:26,031 --> 03:27:27,272
and you can actually see the

2712
03:27:27,272 --> 03:27:29,075
preview, how it looks like.

2713
03:27:29,075 --> 03:27:31,178
For example, if I show you

2714
03:27:31,178 --> 03:27:33,962
this hash here and these two hashes,

2715
03:27:33,962 --> 03:27:35,003
which means a subheading and

2716
03:27:35,003 --> 03:27:41,240
a heading, GitHub figured out it's a

2717
03:27:41,240 --> 03:27:43,844
um heading and it make

2718
03:27:43,844 --> 03:27:46,628
the heading bigger like this um

2719
03:27:46,628 --> 03:27:47,589
and then you can see the

2720
03:27:47,589 --> 03:27:49,312
preview so this magic happened

2721
03:27:49,312 --> 03:27:50,594
because i named the file it

2722
03:27:50,594 --> 03:27:53,578
used the file extension so then uh

2723
03:27:53,578 --> 03:27:55,241
what we do is i will go

2724
03:27:55,241 --> 03:27:57,964
here i'll click on this commit

2725
03:27:57,964 --> 03:27:59,206
button you see this green

2726
03:27:59,206 --> 03:28:01,590
commit button here yeah i will i

2727
03:28:01,590 --> 03:28:03,232
will do the so the commit is

2728
03:28:03,232 --> 03:28:05,607
to i'm going to make that permanent

2729
03:28:05,607 --> 03:28:07,870
and then you see that that

2730
03:28:07,870 --> 03:28:09,773
new branch i created before the

2731
03:28:09,773 --> 03:28:11,235
break i created this branch so

2732
03:28:11,235 --> 03:28:12,738
it's going to land on this

2733
03:28:12,738 --> 03:28:21,010
not on the new branch um sap

2734
03:28:21,010 --> 03:28:22,993
i'll type a small message and

2735
03:28:22,993 --> 03:28:24,912
this is this will be the

2736
03:28:24,912 --> 03:28:27,895
message on the if you see

2737
03:28:27,895 --> 03:28:28,996
that in the in the hash there

2738
03:28:28,996 --> 03:28:31,197
was a small like a short

2739
03:28:31,197 --> 03:28:33,700
message short log message so this is

2740
03:28:33,700 --> 03:28:35,761
what going to appear so

2741
03:28:35,761 --> 03:28:36,922
instead of this file name I'm

2742
03:28:36,922 --> 03:28:38,544
going to say carrot soup so that is

2743
03:28:38,544 --> 03:28:39,865
what will appear in the log

2744
03:28:39,865 --> 03:28:41,706
message then I would say

2745
03:28:41,706 --> 03:28:48,312
create commit the changes do

2746
03:28:48,312 --> 03:28:50,734
you want to discover no

2747
03:28:50,734 --> 03:28:51,895
let's let's commit again maybe

2748
03:28:51,895 --> 03:28:53,957
it didn't happen properly commit

2749
03:28:57,380 --> 03:28:59,101
Maybe it's trying to navigate to

2750
03:28:59,101 --> 03:29:01,143
a new tab, but let's see.

2751
03:29:04,786 --> 03:29:05,367
Let's try again.

2752
03:29:08,029 --> 03:29:10,591
Okay, now we faced an error.

2753
03:29:10,591 --> 03:29:12,593
This was not planned, but

2754
03:29:12,593 --> 03:29:16,957
the error was that git actually committed

2755
03:29:16,957 --> 03:29:18,638
when I clicked the commit button before,

2756
03:29:19,719 --> 03:29:22,161
but due to some redirection in the browser,

2757
03:29:22,161 --> 03:29:24,803
it didn't actually give

2758
03:29:24,803 --> 03:29:26,843
me enough information that it has happened.

2759
03:29:26,843 --> 03:29:28,606
So I tried to do it again,

2760
03:29:28,606 --> 03:29:30,349
but now Git has deleted a

2761
03:29:30,349 --> 03:29:32,752
file with the same name already exists.

2762
03:29:32,752 --> 03:29:35,056
So that's additional help that

2763
03:29:35,056 --> 03:29:38,001
we got from GitHub, not the Git itself,

2764
03:29:38,001 --> 03:29:39,824
but GitHub, that it went

2765
03:29:39,824 --> 03:29:42,268
and detected that there's a file

2766
03:29:42,268 --> 03:29:43,409
that we don't want to commit.

2767
03:29:44,391 --> 03:29:45,693
And then...

2768
03:29:45,693 --> 03:29:46,995
it's give me some option, you

2769
03:29:46,995 --> 03:29:48,056
know what to do.

2770
03:29:48,056 --> 03:29:51,361
So I'm going to now do a cancel here.

2771
03:29:51,361 --> 03:29:52,823
I would have preferred that

2772
03:29:52,823 --> 03:29:53,704
I didn't have to do it.

2773
03:29:53,704 --> 03:29:56,247
But you know, some technical

2774
03:29:56,247 --> 03:29:57,489
problems I didn't.

2775
03:29:57,489 --> 03:29:59,051
But you might you might also

2776
03:29:59,051 --> 03:30:00,894
see that if there's some delay.

2777
03:30:00,894 --> 03:30:03,377
So I'm going back to the recipe book now.

2778
03:30:04,619 --> 03:30:05,901
Now the git will say

2779
03:30:05,901 --> 03:30:07,082
there's unsafe changes.

2780
03:30:07,883 --> 03:30:10,106
But GitHub said that it committed.

2781
03:30:10,106 --> 03:30:12,730
So let's say okay, let's see what happens.

2782
03:30:16,186 --> 03:30:17,507
then I will go to the soups.

2783
03:30:22,352 --> 03:30:24,234
And then if you can see

2784
03:30:24,234 --> 03:30:27,878
here, that file I committed is not here.

2785
03:30:29,159 --> 03:30:30,901
Could you guess why it's not here?

2786
03:30:34,304 --> 03:30:34,785
What do you think?

2787
03:30:34,785 --> 03:30:35,766
Maybe because you are in

2788
03:30:35,766 --> 03:30:36,927
a different branch?

2789
03:30:36,927 --> 03:30:37,768
Correct.

2790
03:30:37,768 --> 03:30:40,310
So in the main branch, that

2791
03:30:40,310 --> 03:30:41,131
file is not there.

2792
03:30:41,131 --> 03:30:45,363
So it's in the...

2793
03:30:45,363 --> 03:30:47,786
new recipe branch, right?

2794
03:30:47,786 --> 03:30:49,368
So the thing I wanted to show

2795
03:30:49,368 --> 03:30:50,889
before the exercise is that how

2796
03:30:50,889 --> 03:30:52,852
to create a branch and how to

2797
03:30:52,852 --> 03:30:54,774
place a file in a specific branch.

2798
03:30:56,436 --> 03:30:57,497
And we also saw

2799
03:30:57,497 --> 03:31:00,100
like unexpectedly encountered error.

2800
03:31:00,100 --> 03:31:01,802
So when I- [name].

2801
03:31:01,802 --> 03:31:02,002
Yes.

2802
03:31:03,684 --> 03:31:05,747
I think a few people from

2803
03:31:05,747 --> 03:31:08,970
Denmark lost the live connection.

2804
03:31:09,952 --> 03:31:10,642
Okay.

2805
03:31:10,642 --> 03:31:14,106
so maybe can we take uh some questions

2806
03:31:14,106 --> 03:31:15,087
if there are any questions

2807
03:31:15,087 --> 03:31:16,889
in the collaborator notes in

2808
03:31:16,889 --> 03:31:18,672
the main right okay yeah

2809
03:31:18,672 --> 03:31:20,073
now they're back actually they're

2810
03:31:20,073 --> 03:31:26,161
back okay yeah they're back okay

2811
03:31:26,161 --> 03:31:28,163
so then um what we do is

2812
03:31:28,163 --> 03:31:30,065
we'll go to the exercise now so

2813
03:31:30,065 --> 03:31:31,146
we are we are in this the

2814
03:31:31,146 --> 03:31:33,489
main lesson page and we are

2815
03:31:33,489 --> 03:31:35,772
going to the commit committing lesson

2816
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:39,845
And then I kind of showed

2817
03:31:39,845 --> 03:31:42,915
the branch and the commit to start with.

2818
03:31:43,797 --> 03:31:45,964
Now you have to practice yourself

2819
03:31:45,964 --> 03:31:46,525
how to do it.

2820
03:31:48,070 --> 03:31:50,999
And the exercise is for 20 minutes.

2821
03:31:50,999 --> 03:31:52,343
And what you should do is,

2822
03:31:53,167 --> 03:31:55,129
First, make sure you're on your fork.

2823
03:31:55,129 --> 03:31:56,590
So that I showed several times

2824
03:31:56,590 --> 03:31:59,053
there on the top that I'm not in the main,

2825
03:31:59,053 --> 03:32:00,254
the place where I forked it

2826
03:32:00,254 --> 03:32:01,975
from, or we call this

2827
03:32:01,975 --> 03:32:04,078
upstream in technical sense.

2828
03:32:04,078 --> 03:32:06,420
You had to be on your fork

2829
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:07,401
or the copy you made.

2830
03:32:08,282 --> 03:32:09,403
First, create a new branch.

2831
03:32:10,304 --> 03:32:14,407
That also, I did in a way, you know,

2832
03:32:14,407 --> 03:32:15,609
the clicked on the main,

2833
03:32:15,609 --> 03:32:16,690
the place where that branch

2834
03:32:16,690 --> 03:32:17,691
symbol is and created one.

2835
03:32:18,672 --> 03:32:20,153
And then...

2836
03:32:21,668 --> 03:32:23,951
you have to modify a recipe

2837
03:32:23,951 --> 03:32:26,514
you just added so um so

2838
03:32:26,514 --> 03:32:28,196
first you need to create a new new branch

2839
03:32:28,196 --> 03:32:31,219
and add a recipe so like i did

2840
03:32:31,219 --> 03:32:32,981
but then you have to modify

2841
03:32:32,981 --> 03:32:34,683
that recipe a little bit so

2842
03:32:34,683 --> 03:32:37,687
first you commit it and then you modify

2843
03:32:37,687 --> 03:32:40,450
that file then you have to

2844
03:32:40,450 --> 03:32:41,751
switch back to the main branch

2845
03:32:43,113 --> 03:32:44,655
uh by clicking on the top

2846
03:32:44,655 --> 03:32:46,036
browser i could go back again

2847
03:32:46,036 --> 03:32:49,698
uh to the reserve the the

2848
03:32:49,698 --> 03:32:51,460
Could you maybe repeat?

2849
03:32:51,460 --> 03:32:54,483
I think a few people are

2850
03:32:54,483 --> 03:32:59,369
saying like a bit fast or something like that.

2851
03:32:59,369 --> 03:32:59,649
Okay.

2852
03:33:01,031 --> 03:33:01,491
Let's see.

2853
03:33:01,491 --> 03:33:02,753
Okay.

2854
03:33:02,753 --> 03:33:05,856
So here first, you have to

2855
03:33:05,856 --> 03:33:07,518
make sure you're in the correct fork.

2856
03:33:08,499 --> 03:33:08,920
Okay.

2857
03:33:08,920 --> 03:33:09,681
Right?

2858
03:33:09,681 --> 03:33:11,443
So the fork is this.

2859
03:33:13,185 --> 03:33:15,227
So if you see, for example,

2860
03:33:15,227 --> 03:33:17,761
here, if I click it,

2861
03:33:17,761 --> 03:33:18,662
Click this one.

2862
03:33:18,662 --> 03:33:19,804
This is the upstream, the way

2863
03:33:19,804 --> 03:33:20,805
I copied it from.

2864
03:33:20,805 --> 03:33:22,206
You shouldn't work here.

2865
03:33:22,206 --> 03:33:23,748
So instead, you should work

2866
03:33:23,748 --> 03:33:26,712
on your fork, the copy you created.

2867
03:33:26,712 --> 03:33:28,574
Then you have to go and

2868
03:33:28,574 --> 03:33:31,037
click the main branch and create

2869
03:33:31,037 --> 03:33:32,960
a branch from that place.

2870
03:33:34,842 --> 03:33:35,723
Right?

2871
03:33:35,723 --> 03:33:35,823
Yes.

2872
03:33:35,823 --> 03:33:37,185
As I did, I created

2873
03:33:37,185 --> 03:33:39,968
this subreddit recipe branch.

2874
03:33:39,968 --> 03:33:41,089
So after that, I'm going

2875
03:33:41,089 --> 03:33:42,771
back to the lesson.

2876
03:33:42,771 --> 03:33:45,154
After that, you have to do as I did,

2877
03:33:47,436 --> 03:33:49,699
contribute a recipe to your branch,

2878
03:33:50,900 --> 03:33:52,262
and then you have to open

2879
03:33:52,262 --> 03:33:54,544
it up again and do some modification.

2880
03:33:54,544 --> 03:33:57,327
Then after modifying that, you

2881
03:33:57,327 --> 03:33:58,609
have to come back to the main branch.

2882
03:33:58,609 --> 03:34:00,571
So you'll have to switch again here.

2883
03:34:00,571 --> 03:34:06,117
So first you do is that

2884
03:34:06,117 --> 03:34:07,258
you work on this branch,

2885
03:34:08,740 --> 03:34:11,564
create a file and commit it

2886
03:34:11,564 --> 03:34:13,146
open it up again and edit

2887
03:34:13,146 --> 03:34:14,889
it and then commit again and

2888
03:34:14,889 --> 03:34:15,930
then switch back to the main

2889
03:34:15,930 --> 03:34:21,258
branch and then change uh

2890
03:34:23,521 --> 03:34:26,445
change change modify a recipe there so the

2891
03:34:27,927 --> 03:34:30,972
As you also show briefly,

2892
03:34:30,972 --> 03:34:33,135
the file I committed is not

2893
03:34:33,135 --> 03:34:34,958
there in the main branch.

2894
03:34:34,958 --> 03:34:36,561
It's in the branch that I created.

2895
03:34:36,561 --> 03:34:37,562
So when you switch back to

2896
03:34:37,562 --> 03:34:39,365
the main branch, you would not

2897
03:34:39,365 --> 03:34:43,131
see the file you created.

2898
03:34:43,131 --> 03:34:44,052
But soon you have to

2899
03:34:44,052 --> 03:34:46,797
modify something in the main branch.

2900
03:34:46,797 --> 03:34:49,100
To make things easier, I would

2901
03:34:49,100 --> 03:34:52,045
say go and modify something in the

2902
03:34:53,071 --> 03:34:57,590
the sites for maybe, for

2903
03:34:57,590 --> 03:35:00,060
example, inside sites, you have this

2904
03:35:01,137 --> 03:35:02,579
Gokomole file.

2905
03:35:02,579 --> 03:35:04,341
So modify that Gokomole file.

2906
03:35:04,341 --> 03:35:05,802
Here it doesn't specify which

2907
03:35:05,802 --> 03:35:06,904
file, but you know, it's okay.

2908
03:35:06,904 --> 03:35:08,566
You can select whichever you want,

2909
03:35:08,566 --> 03:35:09,907
but maybe you could, if you

2910
03:35:09,907 --> 03:35:11,729
don't have a preference, go

2911
03:35:11,729 --> 03:35:14,072
and modify the Gokomole file

2912
03:35:14,072 --> 03:35:16,174
and then follow the instructions

2913
03:35:16,174 --> 03:35:19,078
as even here from five onwards,

2914
03:35:20,299 --> 03:35:23,803
maybe at least number seven.

2915
03:35:25,403 --> 03:35:27,185
You could come, but this will

2916
03:35:27,185 --> 03:35:30,668
also, we will check after you arrive back.

2917
03:35:32,470 --> 03:35:34,012
Is that clear enough, [name],

2918
03:35:34,012 --> 03:35:35,753
or do you want to say something?

2919
03:35:35,753 --> 03:35:37,315
Yeah, it's clear, yes.

2920
03:35:38,436 --> 03:35:38,536
Yes.

2921
03:35:38,536 --> 03:35:39,597
So you go here, go to

2922
03:35:39,597 --> 03:35:42,740
your fork, create a branch, create a file,

2923
03:35:42,740 --> 03:35:45,663
modify it, and then go back

2924
03:35:45,663 --> 03:35:47,245
to the main branch, modify

2925
03:35:47,245 --> 03:35:49,587
something in that branch, and

2926
03:35:49,587 --> 03:35:50,969
then commit that, and then

2927
03:35:50,969 --> 03:35:52,390
follow the instructions.

2928
03:35:53,264 --> 03:35:55,128
there's anything unclear we

2929
03:35:55,128 --> 03:35:58,777
could discuss in the notes yeah for suppose

2930
03:35:58,777 --> 03:36:01,523
if yes so what we do is exercise

2931
03:36:01,523 --> 03:36:03,227
until 20 minutes so we'll give

2932
03:36:03,227 --> 03:36:06,114
a 20 minutes exercise now uh

2933
03:36:06,114 --> 03:36:08,559
starting now and uh bye for

2934
03:36:08,559 --> 03:36:10,745
now but we'll meet after 20

2935
03:36:10,745 --> 03:36:12,268
minutes to discuss the answers

2936
03:55:08,341 --> 03:55:11,686
We'll come back.

2937
03:55:11,686 --> 03:55:12,847
I see there were some

2938
03:55:12,847 --> 03:55:15,151
questions regarding the exercise as well.

2939
03:55:15,952 --> 03:55:17,514
So what I'll try to do is

2940
03:55:17,514 --> 03:55:20,098
I'll keep in mind the questions

2941
03:55:20,098 --> 03:55:22,782
and I will try to go

2942
03:55:22,782 --> 03:55:24,003
through the solutions and try to

2943
03:55:24,003 --> 03:55:25,846
explain them at the same time.

2944
03:55:25,846 --> 03:55:28,229
And when we come back, you

2945
03:55:28,229 --> 03:55:29,711
could point me to the things I missed.

2946
03:55:29,711 --> 03:55:32,295
Okay, sure.

2947
03:55:32,295 --> 03:55:36,441
So we were in this...

2948
03:55:37,771 --> 03:55:40,413
repository, which is a fork or

2949
03:55:40,413 --> 03:55:42,575
a copy from the Code

2950
03:55:42,575 --> 03:55:44,717
Refinery CR workshop exercise

2951
03:55:44,717 --> 03:55:45,658
recipe book branch.

2952
03:55:47,020 --> 03:55:49,662
As you can see, to find

2953
03:55:49,662 --> 03:55:50,983
out which branch you are in,

2954
03:55:50,983 --> 03:55:52,044
there was a question on how to

2955
03:55:52,044 --> 03:55:53,486
find out where I am.

2956
03:55:53,486 --> 03:55:55,968
The best way is to look

2957
03:55:55,968 --> 03:55:59,531
here, and also the URL on the top.

2958
03:55:59,531 --> 03:56:00,552
I'm not sure, yeah, you could

2959
03:56:00,552 --> 03:56:01,673
see the URL as well.

2960
03:56:01,673 --> 03:56:02,574
So in the URL, it will

2961
03:56:02,574 --> 03:56:05,177
say GitHub, my name, and

2962
03:56:05,177 --> 03:56:06,698
then the repository name.

2963
03:56:08,602 --> 03:56:12,287
And then the first thing in the exercise,

2964
03:56:12,287 --> 03:56:13,809
what we were supposed to do

2965
03:56:13,809 --> 03:56:15,491
in the first one is to make.

2966
03:56:17,333 --> 03:56:18,174
Let me check.

2967
03:56:18,174 --> 03:56:21,819
Make sure you are on the on your same fork.

2968
03:56:21,819 --> 03:56:22,760
Same fork.

2969
03:56:22,760 --> 03:56:24,222
So this we make sure.

2970
03:56:24,222 --> 03:56:26,124
Was that clear enough that to

2971
03:56:26,124 --> 03:56:30,210
how to find out about that?

2972
03:56:30,210 --> 03:56:30,610
Yes.

2973
03:56:33,073 --> 03:56:36,057
Then the second point they're

2974
03:56:36,057 --> 03:56:38,538
asking is was to create a new branch, was it?

2975
03:56:38,538 --> 03:56:39,140
Yes.

2976
03:56:39,140 --> 03:56:40,907
Yes.

2977
03:56:40,907 --> 03:56:42,633
There was one question as well.

2978
03:56:42,633 --> 03:56:45,490
When the branch was created,

2979
03:56:45,490 --> 03:56:49,475
somebody already saw some commits

2980
03:56:49,475 --> 03:56:52,017
and that person wondering

2981
03:56:52,017 --> 03:56:54,600
whether somebody has modified

2982
03:56:54,600 --> 03:56:57,764
the original, the upstream version.

2983
03:56:57,764 --> 03:57:00,667
So the upstream version would be,

2984
03:57:00,667 --> 03:57:02,249
even if it is modified, if

2985
03:57:02,249 --> 03:57:04,272
you don't click this button

2986
03:57:04,272 --> 03:57:06,754
here, the sync fork.

2987
03:57:06,754 --> 03:57:07,776
So this is a sync fork

2988
03:57:07,776 --> 03:57:09,457
means to sync with upstream.

2989
03:57:09,457 --> 03:57:12,254
If you have not clicked that,

2990
03:57:12,254 --> 03:57:14,417
whatever done upstream will not

2991
03:57:14,417 --> 03:57:17,402
arrive to your repository.

2992
03:57:17,402 --> 03:57:19,044
Most likely thing that might

2993
03:57:19,044 --> 03:57:21,328
have happened is that when you

2994
03:57:21,328 --> 03:57:22,950
wrote your name of your

2995
03:57:22,950 --> 03:57:25,334
branch, maybe you selected one

2996
03:57:25,334 --> 03:57:27,297
already created instead of creating your own.

2997
03:57:28,719 --> 03:57:30,361
For example, if I go here and

2998
03:57:30,361 --> 03:57:38,734
if I try to create a new recipe,

2999
03:57:39,541 --> 03:57:40,983
That branch is already there,

3000
03:57:40,983 --> 03:57:46,272
but my intention is to create

3001
03:57:46,272 --> 03:57:49,978
a new branch, but that one was already there.

3002
03:57:49,978 --> 03:57:51,521
When I clicked, instead of

3003
03:57:51,521 --> 03:57:52,903
creating a new branch, I

3004
03:57:52,903 --> 03:57:54,906
switched to that branch instead.

3005
03:57:54,906 --> 03:57:57,030
So then if I go to the

3006
03:57:57,030 --> 03:58:01,617
soups, I will see that carrot soup.

3007
03:58:03,048 --> 03:58:05,011
so again i'll go back to

3008
03:58:05,011 --> 03:58:08,896
the the front the the main

3009
03:58:08,896 --> 03:58:11,260
page of the repository and then

3010
03:58:11,260 --> 03:58:13,563
i'll create a new repo new branch

3011
03:58:13,563 --> 03:58:20,433
so the new branch i'll create uh soup 2

3012
03:58:20,433 --> 03:58:22,155
for example then it will

3013
03:58:22,155 --> 03:58:24,719
say create branch and when i

3014
03:58:24,719 --> 03:58:27,863
switch to that branch i should

3015
03:58:27,863 --> 03:58:32,430
not see that carrot soup but let's see

3016
03:58:34,013 --> 03:58:34,635
As you can see, it's

3017
03:58:34,635 --> 03:58:35,397
only the mushroom soup.

3018
03:58:36,922 --> 03:58:38,688
But when I'm creating the branch,

3019
03:58:38,688 --> 03:58:40,634
if I had created it from

3020
03:58:40,634 --> 03:58:42,038
my previous branch instead of

3021
03:58:42,038 --> 03:58:44,240
the main branch, then

3022
03:58:44,240 --> 03:58:49,025
my carrot soup would also be here.

3023
03:58:49,025 --> 03:58:50,506
So a branch could also

3024
03:58:50,506 --> 03:58:52,688
be created from another branch.

3025
03:58:52,688 --> 03:58:53,509
So it doesn't have to be

3026
03:58:53,509 --> 03:58:54,390
from a main branch.

3027
03:58:54,390 --> 03:58:56,752
So that one thing that

3028
03:58:56,752 --> 03:59:00,696
might have happened during the exercise.

3029
03:59:00,696 --> 03:59:02,178
So there are a few things to figure out.

3030
03:59:02,178 --> 03:59:03,820
I think everything you've figured

3031
03:59:03,820 --> 03:59:05,581
out is a learning experience.

3032
03:59:05,581 --> 03:59:09,365
And what was the third question, Iman?

3033
03:59:09,365 --> 03:59:10,046
It was to create?

3034
03:59:11,127 --> 03:59:12,268
New commit, basically.

3035
03:59:12,268 --> 03:59:13,269
New commit, okay.

3036
03:59:13,269 --> 03:59:13,369
Yeah.

3037
03:59:14,328 --> 03:59:16,492
okay so i'm going to soup too

3038
03:59:19,256 --> 03:59:23,343
and then i'm going to go to the branch

3039
03:59:24,886 --> 03:59:26,228
and then if you remember that

3040
03:59:26,228 --> 03:59:28,973
i said create a new file i

3041
03:59:28,973 --> 03:59:30,195
could also upload a file from

3042
03:59:30,195 --> 03:59:33,240
my computer then create a file

3043
03:59:36,064 --> 03:59:37,667
for the sake of explanation i'm

3044
03:59:37,667 --> 03:59:39,390
going to just call it um

3045
03:59:40,805 --> 03:59:42,328
Carrot soup.

3046
03:59:42,328 --> 03:59:42,608
Yeah.

3047
03:59:43,509 --> 03:59:44,832
Carrot soup.

3048
03:59:44,832 --> 03:59:45,513
It's already there.

3049
03:59:45,513 --> 03:59:47,736
So I'm going to call it 2.md.

3050
03:59:49,660 --> 03:59:51,082
And then I'm going to cheat

3051
03:59:51,082 --> 03:59:55,329
a little bit and copy those must-have fields.

3052
03:59:57,412 --> 03:59:58,314
Recipe.

3053
03:59:58,314 --> 04:00:04,564
Carrot soup 2.

3054
04:00:04,564 --> 04:00:05,766
Ingredients.

3055
04:00:09,779 --> 04:00:11,801
carrots and water.

3056
04:00:13,022 --> 04:00:17,888
For the instructions, I will just boil it.

3057
04:00:20,971 --> 04:00:22,413
Not a great recipe, but

3058
04:00:22,413 --> 04:00:24,114
you know, don't judge me for the recipe.

3059
04:00:24,114 --> 04:00:27,358
Just focus on the git part of it.

3060
04:00:27,358 --> 04:00:29,801
I will go and see the review.

3061
04:00:29,801 --> 04:00:31,442
So, it looks good.

3062
04:00:31,442 --> 04:00:34,546
Then I should commit that.

3063
04:00:34,546 --> 04:00:36,208
When I committing it, it will

3064
04:00:36,208 --> 04:00:37,609
commit to the soup2 branch.

3065
04:00:39,884 --> 04:00:41,586
new soup.

3066
04:00:41,586 --> 04:00:46,573
So if you include some detailed details

3067
04:00:46,573 --> 04:00:47,635
for the person who's reading

3068
04:00:47,635 --> 04:00:48,416
it, it'll be helpful.

3069
04:00:48,416 --> 04:00:50,779
You could write some detail about it here.

3070
04:00:50,779 --> 04:00:57,208
I'm writing create a carrot soup.

3071
04:00:57,208 --> 04:01:02,114
I would say simple alternate

3072
04:01:02,114 --> 04:01:06,280
view and commit to this branch.

3073
04:01:09,601 --> 04:01:13,265
Again, that message of

3074
04:01:13,265 --> 04:01:14,887
not redirected properly.

3075
04:01:14,887 --> 04:01:18,510
Then in the fourth question, I

3076
04:01:18,510 --> 04:01:19,411
was asked to modify.

3077
04:01:19,411 --> 04:01:20,633
Was it, Iman?

3078
04:01:20,633 --> 04:01:22,475
Oh, the same file, was it?

3079
04:01:22,475 --> 04:01:24,637
Yes, you have to modify the same file.

3080
04:01:24,637 --> 04:01:27,540
Yeah, same file I should modify.

3081
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:30,323
So I would open this file

3082
04:01:30,323 --> 04:01:34,507
and I will click this edit button.

3083
04:01:34,507 --> 04:01:36,029
Do you see the edit pencil here?

3084
04:01:37,010 --> 04:01:39,149
Yeah, maybe could you zoom a bit there?

3085
04:01:39,149 --> 04:01:42,192
yeah okay so I'll go back

3086
04:01:43,593 --> 04:01:45,395
yeah yeah it's good and then

3087
04:01:45,395 --> 04:01:47,117
I'll click on the file that I

3088
04:01:47,117 --> 04:01:50,540
want to edit then I will say

3089
04:01:50,540 --> 04:01:54,504
uh there's a pencil button somewhere

3090
04:01:54,504 --> 04:01:55,625
I had to zoom out a little

3091
04:01:55,625 --> 04:01:56,385
bit because I don't see the

3092
04:01:56,385 --> 04:01:59,688
pencil yeah here I think it

3093
04:01:59,688 --> 04:02:02,131
should be yeah and then I

3094
04:02:02,131 --> 04:02:07,196
would say maybe salt and then

3095
04:02:07,196 --> 04:02:08,717
I would again click

3096
04:02:09,558 --> 04:02:12,702
this button commit changes and

3097
04:02:12,702 --> 04:02:16,167
here I would say and noted

3098
04:02:18,049 --> 04:02:26,781
salt updated salt and then commit that.

3099
04:02:31,567 --> 04:02:33,350
So, in that branch I would

3100
04:02:33,350 --> 04:02:36,592
see that this is salt is also added.

3101
04:02:36,592 --> 04:02:39,576
Then I was asked to browse the network.

3102
04:02:39,576 --> 04:02:40,898
So what I'll do is.

3103
04:02:41,839 --> 04:02:43,521
I think you have to go to the main.

3104
04:02:44,442 --> 04:02:44,703
Okay.

3105
04:02:44,703 --> 04:02:45,224
Main branch.

3106
04:02:45,224 --> 04:02:45,464
Okay.

3107
04:02:45,464 --> 04:02:45,804
Yeah.

3108
04:02:45,804 --> 04:02:47,787
And modify one file there.

3109
04:02:47,787 --> 04:02:48,508
Modify one file.

3110
04:02:48,508 --> 04:02:48,748
Okay.

3111
04:02:48,748 --> 04:02:49,469
Thank you.

3112
04:02:49,469 --> 04:02:50,571
So then I will go back

3113
04:02:50,571 --> 04:02:54,296
to the main branch here by clicking on the main.

3114
04:03:00,404 --> 04:03:02,266
And that was actually a

3115
04:03:02,266 --> 04:03:03,808
very good thing happened.

3116
04:03:03,808 --> 04:03:05,130
I'll do that again to show you.

3117
04:03:06,528 --> 04:03:07,329
I'm going to soups.

3118
04:03:10,513 --> 04:03:11,755
And I'm going to change back

3119
04:03:11,755 --> 04:03:13,017
to that soup two branch.

3120
04:03:16,001 --> 04:03:19,505
And I'm going to click this carrot soup.

3121
04:03:19,505 --> 04:03:20,426
And I'm going to change to

3122
04:03:20,426 --> 04:03:21,568
the main branch here.

3123
04:03:21,568 --> 04:03:23,851
Now it's going to throw an error.

3124
04:03:23,851 --> 04:03:28,758
See whether you can see that error.

3125
04:03:28,758 --> 04:03:29,979
It says page not found,

3126
04:03:29,979 --> 04:03:31,281
which means that file is not

3127
04:03:31,281 --> 04:03:32,823
there in the main branch, right?

3128
04:03:32,823 --> 04:03:34,345
So that was the reason.

3129
04:03:34,345 --> 04:03:36,245
So then I'll go to...

3130
04:03:36,245 --> 04:03:40,151
the main the root folder

3131
04:03:40,151 --> 04:03:45,318
of that repository and then I will go to sites,

3132
04:03:47,802 --> 04:03:49,545
I will go to the guacamole

3133
04:03:49,545 --> 04:03:55,874
recipe and then edit this and

3134
04:03:55,874 --> 04:04:03,265
I will add maybe make 2 tablespoons of salt.

3135
04:04:05,017 --> 04:04:12,411
and then press commit changes.

3136
04:04:24,575 --> 04:04:27,058
I added a message for log message

3137
04:04:27,058 --> 04:04:29,440
and then I clicked on the...

3138
04:04:29,440 --> 04:04:30,581
Do you see my microphone where

3139
04:04:30,581 --> 04:04:31,622
my mouse pointer is, Saman?

3140
04:04:31,622 --> 04:04:33,384
Or is it not clear that much?

3141
04:04:33,384 --> 04:04:35,366
Yeah, but yes, now I can see that.

3142
04:04:35,366 --> 04:04:39,590
I see the commit.

3143
04:04:39,590 --> 04:04:40,651
Again, my browser is not

3144
04:04:40,651 --> 04:04:41,752
directly reading properly.

3145
04:04:41,752 --> 04:04:42,193
That's fine.

3146
04:04:47,318 --> 04:04:49,060
Now it's two tablespoons.

3147
04:04:49,060 --> 04:04:50,781
So next one is the network, right?

3148
04:04:50,781 --> 04:04:52,621
Yes, next one is the network.

3149
04:04:52,621 --> 04:04:54,704
Then I will go to Insights.

3150
04:04:54,704 --> 04:04:56,326
So if your browser is a

3151
04:04:56,326 --> 04:04:59,891
little more zoomed out, then you

3152
04:04:59,891 --> 04:05:01,212
will see the button.

3153
04:05:01,212 --> 04:05:04,217
But here, you will see a

3154
04:05:04,217 --> 04:05:05,779
menu entry called Insight.

3155
04:05:05,779 --> 04:05:11,246
Go to Insight and click on Network.

3156
04:05:14,030 --> 04:05:16,173
Then you see, as many of

3157
04:05:16,173 --> 04:05:18,275
you experience, it sometimes takes

3158
04:05:18,275 --> 04:05:20,043
time to render this.

3159
04:05:20,043 --> 04:05:22,546
So when I copied from

3160
04:05:22,546 --> 04:05:24,929
the upstream, I copied all the branches.

3161
04:05:24,929 --> 04:05:26,111
So if I had copied only

3162
04:05:26,111 --> 04:05:29,315
the main branch, then I would not see.

3163
04:05:29,315 --> 04:05:30,496
But these are all the

3164
04:05:30,496 --> 04:05:32,599
changes that were done in the

3165
04:05:32,599 --> 04:05:34,161
past in that repository.

3166
04:05:34,161 --> 04:05:35,363
So I see all the changes.

3167
04:05:36,644 --> 04:05:39,628
So I see this my change here.

3168
04:05:39,628 --> 04:05:45,055
We have to rotate our head.

3169
04:05:45,996 --> 04:05:47,118
What is that?

3170
04:05:47,118 --> 04:05:49,152
We have to rotate our head.

3171
04:05:49,152 --> 04:05:52,198
yes so let me check where my branches

3172
04:05:52,198 --> 04:05:54,442
so this is here you see if

3173
04:05:54,442 --> 04:05:55,544
it came from the main branch

3174
04:05:56,586 --> 04:05:58,449
they were here yeah and then

3175
04:05:58,449 --> 04:06:02,577
i have done some changes and

3176
04:06:02,577 --> 04:06:05,462
then um the main branch itself

3177
04:06:06,885 --> 04:06:12,595
has moved um so this is the latest one

3178
04:06:14,212 --> 04:06:16,015
This is not the latest one.

3179
04:06:16,015 --> 04:06:18,019
Because you have two accounts, I think.

3180
04:06:18,019 --> 04:06:20,483
So this was the earlier one.

3181
04:06:20,483 --> 04:06:22,566
And this is now integrated.

3182
04:06:22,566 --> 04:06:27,435
The one I did now is this one.

3183
04:06:27,435 --> 04:06:29,138
Yeah.

3184
04:06:29,138 --> 04:06:30,120
So this is the main branch

3185
04:06:30,120 --> 04:06:31,242
that has moved forward.

3186
04:06:31,242 --> 04:06:32,424
And this is the branch

3187
04:06:32,424 --> 04:06:33,926
I created, create correct sub

3188
04:06:33,926 --> 04:06:36,330
branch, and it's not joined yet.

3189
04:06:36,330 --> 04:06:37,873
So the main branch has something.

3190
04:06:38,849 --> 04:06:41,452
the correct, the suggestion

3191
04:06:41,452 --> 04:06:42,733
branch has something, but because

3192
04:06:42,733 --> 04:06:45,316
of this is now little, like

3193
04:06:45,316 --> 04:06:46,397
too many things are there.

3194
04:06:47,638 --> 04:06:48,899
Might be little complicated, but

3195
04:06:48,899 --> 04:06:52,423
the thing you should notice is that there is,

3196
04:06:52,423 --> 04:06:53,504
there are two commits, these

3197
04:06:53,504 --> 04:06:56,186
two dots, which are not in the main branch.

3198
04:06:57,027 --> 04:06:58,088
And there is this dot,

3199
04:06:58,088 --> 04:06:59,570
the main branch, which is not

3200
04:06:59,570 --> 04:07:00,231
in the blue branch.

3201
04:07:01,812 --> 04:07:04,675
So in the next part of the lesson

3202
04:07:04,675 --> 04:07:06,317
that [name] would show you

3203
04:07:06,317 --> 04:07:08,363
how to combine this, right?

3204
04:07:08,363 --> 04:07:12,251
Yes.

3205
04:07:12,251 --> 04:07:12,491
Yeah.

3206
04:07:14,114 --> 04:07:15,818
So then what they're asking

3207
04:07:15,818 --> 04:07:18,704
switch to the main project, modify the recipe.

3208
04:07:18,704 --> 04:07:21,229
I've been the fifth question now.

3209
04:07:21,229 --> 04:07:22,972
Now we are in the seventh

3210
04:07:22,972 --> 04:07:26,098
because now we compared Okay,

3211
04:07:26,098 --> 04:07:28,225
compare the branch that you created.

3212
04:07:28,225 --> 04:07:28,946
Yeah.

3213
04:07:28,946 --> 04:07:29,526
With the main part.

3214
04:07:29,526 --> 04:07:31,368
So that comparison, we did

3215
04:07:31,368 --> 04:07:33,050
that visually, but there's a better

3216
04:07:33,050 --> 04:07:33,750
way to do that.

3217
04:07:34,872 --> 04:07:40,177
Like we could use this URL to compare it.

3218
04:07:42,079 --> 04:07:46,002
Here we use the, if you,

3219
04:07:46,002 --> 04:07:47,584
so this is a little tricky.

3220
04:07:47,584 --> 04:07:49,266
So if you see my URL,

3221
04:07:49,266 --> 04:07:52,989
maybe [name], could you reduce

3222
04:07:52,989 --> 04:07:54,311
the video a little bit so

3223
04:07:54,311 --> 04:07:55,752
the URL will be visible?

3224
04:07:57,723 --> 04:08:00,507
Maybe even off the video for a while.

3225
04:08:00,507 --> 04:08:01,088
Oh, yes.

3226
04:08:01,088 --> 04:08:02,210
Yeah.

3227
04:08:02,210 --> 04:08:06,797
In the top URL, you go to the recipe,

3228
04:08:06,797 --> 04:08:10,543
that repository, and then I

3229
04:08:10,543 --> 04:08:12,727
will post this in the shared

3230
04:08:12,727 --> 04:08:15,291
document and type compare.

3231
04:08:16,332 --> 04:08:18,135
The word compare, if you type compare,

3232
04:08:20,239 --> 04:08:21,280
it opens up a way

3233
04:08:21,280 --> 04:08:24,325
to compare the repositories.

3234
04:08:24,325 --> 04:08:26,056
What's the difference?

3235
04:08:26,056 --> 04:08:28,559
for example with the main and

3236
04:08:29,520 --> 04:08:32,764
the main I have so that

3237
04:08:32,764 --> 04:08:35,848
the top the repository is the upstream

3238
04:08:37,050 --> 04:08:38,772
and the main I have there's one change

3239
04:08:38,772 --> 04:08:40,294
that I change sort but what

3240
04:08:40,294 --> 04:08:42,256
we want to do now is to

3241
04:08:42,256 --> 04:08:46,141
check the change between my

3242
04:08:47,743 --> 04:08:53,430
repository main and with the

3243
04:08:54,946 --> 04:08:56,308
soup to rest repository.

3244
04:08:58,231 --> 04:09:00,775
So is this a expected,

3245
04:09:00,775 --> 04:09:02,858
uh, change, uh, Haman or not?

3246
04:09:04,420 --> 04:09:06,363
You are still in your repository, right?

3247
04:09:06,363 --> 04:09:08,106
In the main repository.

3248
04:09:08,106 --> 04:09:08,707
Yeah.

3249
04:09:08,707 --> 04:09:10,069
So I'm comparing with the main

3250
04:09:10,069 --> 04:09:11,952
branch of my repository, my, my

3251
04:09:11,952 --> 04:09:16,138
copy with the soup to a branch of my copy.

3252
04:09:16,999 --> 04:09:19,243
So these are the two changes I did.

3253
04:09:19,243 --> 04:09:20,725
So it clearly shows that I

3254
04:09:21,786 --> 04:09:24,210
have added a file compared to the main branch.

3255
04:09:25,777 --> 04:09:31,269
But it did not show that I changed salt.

3256
04:09:32,411 --> 04:09:34,135
Remember that I also changed salt.

3257
04:09:34,135 --> 04:09:35,277
So in order to do that,

3258
04:09:35,277 --> 04:09:36,941
you have to perform this

3259
04:09:36,941 --> 04:09:38,284
comparison other way around.

3260
04:09:38,284 --> 04:09:40,789
So you have to select soup 2 here.

3261
04:09:43,254 --> 04:09:45,118
And then main here.

3262
04:09:47,360 --> 04:09:48,963
In that comparison, it will

3263
04:09:48,963 --> 04:09:52,010
show that there's a difference of sort here.

3264
04:09:52,010 --> 04:09:54,636
The green is added, red is removed.

3265
04:09:54,636 --> 04:09:57,682
So you have to make sure

3266
04:09:57,682 --> 04:10:01,518
the direction of comparison

3267
04:10:01,518 --> 04:10:03,783
to see the changes.

3268
04:10:03,783 --> 04:10:04,825
So there's a change.

3269
04:10:04,825 --> 04:10:06,569
There are some commits that are

3270
04:10:06,569 --> 04:10:07,691
not in the main branch, but

3271
04:10:07,691 --> 04:10:09,976
in the SUP2 branch that I could see in one way.

3272
04:10:10,938 --> 04:10:12,642
And there are changes in the main branch,

3273
04:10:12,642 --> 04:10:14,465
which are not in the SUP2 branch

3274
04:10:14,465 --> 04:10:15,989
that also you could see, but

3275
04:10:15,989 --> 04:10:17,091
you have to make sure you

3276
04:10:17,091 --> 04:10:18,514
select the correct direction here.

3277
04:10:20,182 --> 04:10:24,926
also commits, you could compare

3278
04:10:24,926 --> 04:10:26,568
in this way with this URL.

3279
04:10:28,049 --> 04:10:30,211
So, the way to compare is

3280
04:10:30,211 --> 04:10:32,313
that let us say we want to,

3281
04:10:32,313 --> 04:10:33,834
I will go to this repository,

3282
04:10:33,834 --> 04:10:35,436
the base of that repository.

3283
04:10:36,617 --> 04:10:42,982
And I will go to the soups folder here.

3284
04:10:42,982 --> 04:10:49,882
And I will change back

3285
04:10:49,882 --> 04:10:53,185
to the soup two branch.

3286
04:10:53,185 --> 04:10:54,926
So then I see my carrot soup.

3287
04:10:54,926 --> 04:10:56,247
So this is the place where

3288
04:10:56,247 --> 04:10:57,628
we did the changes.

3289
04:10:57,628 --> 04:11:02,232
So I will, the file and the change.

3290
04:11:02,232 --> 04:11:04,454
Then I will go here and

3291
04:11:04,454 --> 04:11:06,936
then I will click on blame.

3292
04:11:08,317 --> 04:11:09,659
So this showed that, you

3293
04:11:09,659 --> 04:11:11,740
know, I created this file, who

3294
04:11:11,740 --> 04:11:13,942
created the file and then the

3295
04:11:13,942 --> 04:11:20,560
change I did by adding salt in this case.

3296
04:11:20,560 --> 04:11:22,104
Now I want to find out

3297
04:11:22,104 --> 04:11:24,431
the commit hashes of this.

3298
04:11:24,431 --> 04:11:25,353
Do you know how to?

3299
04:11:25,353 --> 04:11:26,737
I think you showed in your

3300
04:11:26,737 --> 04:11:28,723
lesson how to find the commit hashes.

3301
04:11:28,723 --> 04:11:29,706
Do you remember?

3302
04:11:29,706 --> 04:11:31,591
Can you remind me again, [name]?

3303
04:11:31,591 --> 04:11:33,476
Was it history?

3304
04:11:33,476 --> 04:11:34,840
Yes, you can add this.

3305
04:11:37,486 --> 04:11:38,628
So here we want to

3306
04:11:38,628 --> 04:11:40,251
compare between these two versions.

3307
04:11:40,251 --> 04:11:41,152
So I want to see

3308
04:11:41,152 --> 04:11:43,035
the difference between these two versions.

3309
04:11:43,035 --> 04:11:46,702
So what I will do is I will copy this hash,

3310
04:11:46,702 --> 04:11:48,124
but it will copy the entire

3311
04:11:48,124 --> 04:11:50,308
big, like the long string, but

3312
04:11:50,308 --> 04:11:52,471
I only need the seven strings in the beginning.

3313
04:11:53,693 --> 04:11:57,019
Again, I need to go

3314
04:11:57,019 --> 04:12:01,787
here, recipe book, recorded, and

3315
04:12:01,787 --> 04:12:03,510
I have to remove all this.

3316
04:12:05,144 --> 04:12:06,726
and I typed compare.

3317
04:12:06,726 --> 04:12:08,368
So this, what I'm typing is

3318
04:12:08,368 --> 04:12:09,309
given in the answer.

3319
04:12:09,309 --> 04:12:12,754
So I'm relying on that text

3320
04:12:12,754 --> 04:12:15,417
to be, you know, for you to reference.

3321
04:12:15,417 --> 04:12:16,558
And then for this, I don't

3322
04:12:16,558 --> 04:12:18,481
need the whole hash.

3323
04:12:18,481 --> 04:12:20,583
I only need about seven, eight.

3324
04:12:20,583 --> 04:12:21,965
It doesn't matter one, two,

3325
04:12:21,965 --> 04:12:26,130
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

3326
04:12:26,130 --> 04:12:26,671
Okay.

3327
04:12:26,671 --> 04:12:28,433
Then you need two dots.

3328
04:12:28,433 --> 04:12:29,374
You can also remove zero.

3329
04:12:30,456 --> 04:12:30,696
Okay.

3330
04:12:31,942 --> 04:12:32,523
dots.

3331
04:12:32,523 --> 04:12:33,443
So even if you have the

3332
04:12:33,443 --> 04:12:34,244
zero, it doesn't matter.

3333
04:12:34,244 --> 04:12:37,728
But you need minimum of seven.

3334
04:12:37,728 --> 04:12:39,489
And I copy this hash.

3335
04:12:40,430 --> 04:12:41,691
And I paste it.

3336
04:12:41,691 --> 04:12:43,413
I just paste it as it is.

3337
04:12:43,413 --> 04:12:44,794
I hope let me check whether

3338
04:12:44,794 --> 04:12:45,595
you can see that.

3339
04:12:46,656 --> 04:12:50,600
Yeah, I can see that on the screen.

3340
04:12:50,600 --> 04:12:52,262
Yeah, so I'll copy this.

3341
04:12:52,262 --> 04:12:52,762
Yes.

3342
04:12:54,204 --> 04:12:56,126
And the text here is that

3343
04:12:56,126 --> 04:12:59,212
I'll go back to the

3344
04:12:59,212 --> 04:13:02,858
our lesson material.

3345
04:13:02,858 --> 04:13:04,000
I can show you again.

3346
04:13:04,000 --> 04:13:04,921
Then I press enter.

3347
04:13:08,147 --> 04:13:09,489
Then it will go and find

3348
04:13:09,489 --> 04:13:13,796
out the difference between those two hashes

3349
04:13:13,796 --> 04:13:15,419
or those two commits were that

3350
04:13:15,419 --> 04:13:20,267
one had sort and one did not have sort.

3351
04:13:20,267 --> 04:13:25,455
So I'll go back to that the

3352
04:13:26,819 --> 04:13:29,282
and I will show you where it is written.

3353
04:13:31,464 --> 04:13:32,005
I am going to, I am

3354
04:13:32,005 --> 04:13:36,350
scrolling down, browse commits and

3355
04:13:36,350 --> 04:13:37,992
then compare branches.

3356
04:13:37,992 --> 04:13:39,533
So, here you will see that command.

3357
04:13:39,533 --> 04:13:40,554
So, if you if you did not see

3358
04:13:40,554 --> 04:13:41,696
that on the URL, especially

3359
04:13:41,696 --> 04:13:43,558
on Twitch, it might be a little blurred.

3360
04:13:44,519 --> 04:13:46,041
The way you should type the

3361
04:13:46,041 --> 04:13:47,562
URL is here and also

3362
04:13:47,562 --> 04:13:50,886
comparing arbitrary commits.

3363
04:13:52,064 --> 04:13:54,067
way I did was the repository's

3364
04:13:54,067 --> 04:13:56,351
name I typed compare in the front

3365
04:13:56,351 --> 04:13:58,734
and the hashes that I copied

3366
04:13:58,734 --> 04:14:00,838
you could use the whole the cache

3367
04:14:00,838 --> 04:14:03,322
as it is that the hash as it is

3368
04:14:03,322 --> 04:14:05,024
or you know you minimum seven

3369
04:14:05,024 --> 04:14:09,411
needed to get that answer then

3370
04:14:09,411 --> 04:14:11,955
there is a rename your branch so

3371
04:14:11,955 --> 04:14:14,539
let's see if I go back here

3372
04:14:14,539 --> 04:14:18,325
I want to rename this branch that I created

3373
04:14:19,638 --> 04:14:21,300
For that, there are several ways

3374
04:14:21,300 --> 04:14:23,944
to do this in the GitHub interface.

3375
04:14:23,944 --> 04:14:26,046
So the first thing is you

3376
04:14:26,046 --> 04:14:27,088
need to find the branch.

3377
04:14:27,088 --> 04:14:29,351
You could go and click on

3378
04:14:29,351 --> 04:14:32,054
your recipe to go to the home

3379
04:14:32,054 --> 04:14:35,539
page of this, the base of the repository.

3380
04:14:36,500 --> 04:14:41,827
Then you could click this branches here.

3381
04:14:41,827 --> 04:14:45,102
Near main, you have this...

3382
04:14:45,102 --> 04:14:48,106
tap for branches then you will

3383
04:14:48,106 --> 04:14:50,629
see all the branches that's the easiest way

3384
04:14:50,629 --> 04:14:52,811
for me to find out is

3385
04:14:52,811 --> 04:14:53,912
there any other way to find

3386
04:14:53,912 --> 04:14:59,039
the branch Iman I think if you

3387
04:14:59,039 --> 04:15:02,062
go again the same place I mean

3388
04:15:02,062 --> 04:15:03,464
you can also look at view

3389
04:15:03,464 --> 04:15:06,868
all branches but if you click

3390
04:15:06,868 --> 04:15:10,452
on the main I think there is one last icon which

3391
04:15:11,444 --> 04:15:13,387
we've all branches yeah this

3392
04:15:13,387 --> 04:15:15,229
is other way but the one

3393
04:15:15,229 --> 04:15:17,031
you showed is much better in

3394
04:15:17,031 --> 04:15:19,975
terms of one click right here yeah

3395
04:15:19,975 --> 04:15:22,418
so you you have to come to this place

3396
04:15:22,418 --> 04:15:23,219
and let's say if you want

3397
04:15:23,219 --> 04:15:26,343
to rename this branch to a

3398
04:15:26,343 --> 04:15:28,026
little bit get some space here

3399
04:15:28,026 --> 04:15:29,407
because i can see all the

3400
04:15:29,407 --> 04:15:30,929
the buttons you have to go

3401
04:15:30,929 --> 04:15:34,334
here click on this three dots

3402
04:15:36,056 --> 04:15:39,741
and then rename the branch and

3403
04:15:39,741 --> 04:15:41,383
you could say soup three for example

3404
04:15:44,823 --> 04:15:47,426
And now it is called SUP3.

3405
04:15:47,426 --> 04:15:48,948
You might see, don't see it immediately.

3406
04:15:48,948 --> 04:15:49,809
You don't see it here,

3407
04:15:49,809 --> 04:15:51,731
but you could refresh the page

3408
04:15:53,894 --> 04:15:55,295
and you'll see that it's SUP3.

3409
04:15:57,658 --> 04:15:59,380
So that is how you rename the branch.

3410
04:15:59,380 --> 04:16:01,603
And tag also you could create.

3411
04:16:01,603 --> 04:16:04,446
So the tag is like when

3412
04:16:04,446 --> 04:16:06,068
you're publishing a paper, for

3413
04:16:06,068 --> 04:16:07,330
example, you could attach, you

3414
04:16:07,330 --> 04:16:09,772
know, this is the version I published a paper.

3415
04:16:09,772 --> 04:16:11,274
Or if you are releasing a code base,

3416
04:16:11,274 --> 04:16:12,135
you could say, you know,

3417
04:16:12,135 --> 04:16:14,708
release one, release two, that kind of things.

3418
04:16:14,708 --> 04:16:18,053
for that also you could go

3419
04:16:18,053 --> 04:16:21,859
to the front page to your repository

3420
04:16:21,859 --> 04:16:22,680
and here there is this

3421
04:16:22,680 --> 04:16:24,863
sticky tape sticky note kind of

3422
04:16:24,863 --> 04:16:28,408
thing tag then you could click that

3423
04:16:31,132 --> 04:16:32,494
and then I have some one

3424
04:16:32,494 --> 04:16:35,078
tag here already created you could

3425
04:16:35,078 --> 04:16:37,542
create a tag by using releases

3426
04:16:40,526 --> 04:16:41,728
and then create a new release

3427
04:16:44,240 --> 04:16:45,261
I'll call it release one.

3428
04:16:50,368 --> 04:16:54,434
Tag, I would say beta 01.

3429
04:16:56,016 --> 04:16:59,201
Usually, it'll be something

3430
04:16:59,201 --> 04:17:03,346
like version one, for example, version B1.

3431
04:17:07,652 --> 04:17:08,273
It's a tag.

3432
04:17:08,273 --> 04:17:13,200
And then the version used in the

3433
04:17:14,935 --> 04:17:16,237
publication, for example.

3434
04:17:18,059 --> 04:17:20,161
And you are releasing the main one?

3435
04:17:21,823 --> 04:17:22,164
Yes.

3436
04:17:22,164 --> 04:17:24,827
So I'm going to release the main branch.

3437
04:17:26,329 --> 04:17:27,170
Then you publish it.

3438
04:17:29,373 --> 04:17:32,076
So when that is done, you will see

3439
04:17:32,076 --> 04:17:34,759
that if I go to the front

3440
04:17:34,759 --> 04:17:39,325
page of this, if I click on

3441
04:17:39,325 --> 04:17:44,180
tags, I'll see that one I created as well.

3442
04:17:44,180 --> 04:17:48,146
So, before we go for a

3443
04:17:48,146 --> 04:17:50,749
break, I could show some

3444
04:17:50,749 --> 04:17:51,731
discussions here as well.

3445
04:17:54,094 --> 04:17:56,758
You know, as part, so this,

3446
04:17:56,758 --> 04:17:58,160
you could have the branches.

3447
04:17:58,160 --> 04:17:59,302
If only you are working,

3448
04:17:59,302 --> 04:18:00,563
you could also commit to the

3449
04:18:00,563 --> 04:18:01,405
main branch if you wish.

3450
04:18:05,190 --> 04:18:06,632
You could commit to branches

3451
04:18:06,632 --> 04:18:08,695
if there are multiple lines of work at

3452
04:18:08,695 --> 04:18:09,636
once and you could want

3453
04:18:09,636 --> 04:18:11,980
them to interfere with each other.

3454
04:18:11,980 --> 04:18:14,200
I mean,

3455
04:18:14,200 --> 04:18:17,503
So to be honest, we don't

3456
04:18:17,503 --> 04:18:18,644
work with code this way.

3457
04:18:18,644 --> 04:18:20,766
We don't work on the browser this way.

3458
04:18:20,766 --> 04:18:22,467
Either we use the terminal or

3459
04:18:22,467 --> 04:18:27,591
we use the integrated development environment.

3460
04:18:27,591 --> 04:18:28,913
So in those environment,

3461
04:18:28,913 --> 04:18:30,914
we collect relevant changes together

3462
04:18:30,914 --> 04:18:31,975
when we make a commit.

3463
04:18:31,975 --> 04:18:34,637
So you don't just collect

3464
04:18:34,637 --> 04:18:36,459
some random files and make a commit.

3465
04:18:36,459 --> 04:18:40,442
So it's like a collection of files.

3466
04:18:40,442 --> 04:18:43,465
And then if you don't want to

3467
04:18:44,288 --> 04:18:47,312
some file to be like in the Git.

3468
04:18:47,312 --> 04:18:48,474
For example, maybe there's

3469
04:18:48,474 --> 04:18:49,835
some password file or maybe

3470
04:18:49,835 --> 04:18:51,938
if you're working with cloud,

3471
04:18:51,938 --> 04:18:54,902
there might be some like a

3472
04:18:54,902 --> 04:18:56,264
key that you are using for

3473
04:18:56,264 --> 04:18:57,926
testing so that you don't want to

3474
04:18:58,767 --> 04:19:01,171
send it to the GitHub.

3475
04:19:01,171 --> 04:19:02,933
Then there is this gitignore

3476
04:19:03,994 --> 04:19:05,597
that would be useful.

3477
04:19:05,597 --> 04:19:07,039
So everything that is included

3478
04:19:07,039 --> 04:19:08,801
in the gitignore would not end

3479
04:19:08,801 --> 04:19:10,203
up in the GitHub.

3480
04:19:10,203 --> 04:19:13,367
So that's the end of that exercise.

3481
04:19:15,052 --> 04:19:16,855
And let me check the nodes.

3482
04:19:18,017 --> 04:19:19,019
Did I miss anything here?

3483
04:19:23,867 --> 04:19:26,451
What does it mean for one of the commits?

3484
04:19:26,451 --> 04:19:26,711
Okay.

3485
04:19:28,855 --> 04:19:30,478
So that is like the tag

3486
04:19:30,478 --> 04:19:31,700
referred to a commit.

3487
04:19:31,700 --> 04:19:33,282
So when I said the main branch

3488
04:19:33,282 --> 04:19:35,626
and created a tag, it created

3489
04:19:35,626 --> 04:19:38,511
the late tag on the latest commit.

3490
04:19:41,647 --> 04:19:43,329
uh where where did somebody

3491
04:19:43,329 --> 04:19:45,372
find the must have content for

3492
04:19:45,372 --> 04:19:47,755
the new file could my file

3493
04:19:48,576 --> 04:19:50,398
lacking this content means okay

3494
04:19:50,398 --> 04:19:51,940
so the must have content is

3495
04:19:51,940 --> 04:19:56,786
there on the document um so if

3496
04:19:56,786 --> 04:20:01,832
you if you see this uh answers uh antique answer

3497
04:20:03,635 --> 04:20:07,702
under 2, number 2, you will

3498
04:20:07,702 --> 04:20:09,065
find this must have content.

3499
04:20:09,065 --> 04:20:11,269
You could also try misspelling

3500
04:20:11,269 --> 04:20:12,551
this and see what happens.

3501
04:20:15,015 --> 04:20:16,337
And then the next one is

3502
04:20:16,337 --> 04:20:17,479
when trying to make a tag

3503
04:20:17,479 --> 04:20:19,483
and associated it with the commit.

3504
04:20:22,957 --> 04:20:24,620
This may be due to that

3505
04:20:25,542 --> 04:20:26,544
you're in a different branch.

3506
04:20:26,544 --> 04:20:28,648
So the latest commit might be in a branch.

3507
04:20:28,648 --> 04:20:29,409
You have to make sure that

3508
04:20:29,409 --> 04:20:30,691
you're in a branch.

3509
04:20:30,691 --> 04:20:32,194
If you try to tag it, if

3510
04:20:32,194 --> 04:20:33,076
you don't see a commit,

3511
04:20:33,937 --> 04:20:35,681
most likely scenario would, you

3512
04:20:35,681 --> 04:20:37,023
know, one scenario would be that

3513
04:20:37,023 --> 04:20:38,225
you might be in a different branch.

3514
04:20:44,337 --> 04:20:46,818
Okay, so these things we will

3515
04:20:46,818 --> 04:20:48,180
talk about a little bit

3516
04:20:48,180 --> 04:20:53,929
this in the collaborative version part as well.

3517
04:20:53,929 --> 04:20:56,113
But I would think that now we go

3518
04:20:56,113 --> 04:20:58,737
for a break, [name], and when we come back,

3519
04:20:58,737 --> 04:21:01,461
we'll discuss more and we will

3520
04:21:01,461 --> 04:21:04,265
see how to integrate this.

3521
04:21:04,265 --> 04:21:06,188
So then we can answer those questions.

3522
04:21:07,090 --> 04:21:08,432
Somebody has used the term push here,

3523
04:21:08,432 --> 04:21:12,158
but first we need to merge

3524
04:21:12,158 --> 04:21:15,218
this content to the main branch.

3525
04:21:15,218 --> 04:21:20,433
So now we break [name] for 10 minutes

3526
04:21:21,276 --> 04:21:22,740
and we'll come back and then

3527
04:21:22,740 --> 04:21:23,864
when we come back, [name]

3528
04:21:23,864 --> 04:21:26,532
would continue the merging part

3529
04:21:27,595 --> 04:21:28,217
and bye for now.

3530
04:21:29,200 --> 04:21:29,380
Yep.

3531
04:31:26,296 --> 04:31:27,338
[name], I could hear you.

3532
04:31:34,753 --> 04:31:35,755
No, [name], can you hear him?

3533
04:31:38,781 --> 04:31:40,925
Hey, I can hear you.

3534
04:31:40,925 --> 04:31:42,007
Can you hear Iman?

3535
04:31:42,849 --> 04:31:43,330
I guess not.

3536
04:31:44,131 --> 04:31:44,592
OK.

3537
04:31:49,246 --> 04:31:50,828
I think it's a network issue, maybe.

3538
04:31:50,828 --> 04:31:52,951
Yeah, now I can hear you.

3539
04:31:52,951 --> 04:31:53,432
OK, fine.

3540
04:31:53,432 --> 04:31:54,454
Good, good.

3541
04:31:54,454 --> 04:31:55,555
OK, welcome back.

3542
04:31:55,555 --> 04:31:57,117
Welcome back from the break.

3543
04:31:57,117 --> 04:31:58,459
So yeah, this is the

3544
04:31:58,459 --> 04:32:01,704
last session today, which is about merging.

3545
04:32:01,704 --> 04:32:08,554
OK, so let me increase the screen, maybe.

3546
04:32:29,003 --> 04:32:33,830
Till now what we saw is like we did this,

3547
04:32:33,830 --> 04:32:35,472
we started with looking at

3548
04:32:35,472 --> 04:32:37,715
the existing repository and then

3549
04:32:37,715 --> 04:32:40,359
we forked the repository, which is

3550
04:32:40,359 --> 04:32:41,521
like we took a copy of it

3551
04:32:41,521 --> 04:32:44,205
and then we started editing it.

3552
04:32:44,205 --> 04:32:47,409
Now you try to add some new features

3553
04:32:47,409 --> 04:32:49,472
and now you want to like

3554
04:32:49,472 --> 04:32:51,515
push it back to the main repository.

3555
04:32:51,515 --> 04:32:53,638
So that is what you're going to do now.

3556
04:32:53,638 --> 04:32:56,462
So basically, yeah.

3557
04:32:57,961 --> 04:33:00,646
And just a quick remark, basically

3558
04:33:00,646 --> 04:33:02,008
when you are doing this

3559
04:33:02,008 --> 04:33:04,412
pushing emerging changes, so

3560
04:33:05,855 --> 04:33:07,317
you're satisfied with whatever the

3561
04:33:07,317 --> 04:33:08,900
fixes you made or what are

3562
04:33:08,900 --> 04:33:10,423
the features you want to add,

3563
04:33:10,423 --> 04:33:11,745
now you want to propose the changes.

3564
04:33:12,727 --> 04:33:14,049
So that is what you are

3565
04:33:14,049 --> 04:33:17,435
here in your branch where you just forked

3566
04:33:17,435 --> 04:33:19,399
and added your new features and

3567
04:33:19,399 --> 04:33:21,282
now you ask for a pull request.

3568
04:33:21,282 --> 04:33:24,467
which means that we are asking for,

3569
04:33:24,467 --> 04:33:26,831
we have these changes and

3570
04:33:26,831 --> 04:33:29,676
just include these changes in the main branch.

3571
04:33:31,218 --> 04:33:33,181
For this tutorial, we will

3572
04:33:33,181 --> 04:33:35,305
stick with your own branch,

3573
04:33:35,305 --> 04:33:37,328
with your own repository.

3574
04:33:37,328 --> 04:33:40,934
Please don't push any changes

3575
04:33:40,934 --> 04:33:43,017
to the upstream recipe book.

3576
04:33:43,017 --> 04:33:46,184
There are three different ways

3577
04:33:46,184 --> 04:33:48,128
of doing this, but today we

3578
04:33:48,128 --> 04:33:49,511
will focus on the GitHub path,

3579
04:33:50,312 --> 04:33:51,956
and maybe in the coming days

3580
04:33:51,956 --> 04:33:53,860
you will learn the other ways.

3581
04:33:53,860 --> 04:33:56,365
If you are happy with the VS Code

3582
04:33:56,365 --> 04:33:58,089
or command line, you will

3583
04:33:59,331 --> 04:34:01,175
come across in the next few days.

3584
04:34:01,175 --> 04:34:01,976
Okay.

3585
04:34:01,976 --> 04:34:03,457
So here is the exercise.

3586
04:34:03,457 --> 04:34:04,518
And what you're going to do

3587
04:34:04,518 --> 04:34:09,603
is like, let's start with this branch.

3588
04:34:09,603 --> 04:34:12,346
So this is like the branch.

3589
04:34:12,346 --> 04:34:13,707
Currently, what you are looking is.

3590
04:34:19,392 --> 04:34:20,614
I'm losing sound.

3591
04:34:28,641 --> 04:34:29,342
No, I couldn't hear you.

3592
04:34:34,402 --> 04:34:35,645
I guess we have.

3593
04:34:35,645 --> 04:34:38,833
If you haven't created a new

3594
04:34:38,833 --> 04:34:40,096
recipe, try to create the new

3595
04:34:40,096 --> 04:34:42,682
recipe and then you now try

3596
04:34:42,682 --> 04:34:45,033
to do the pull request.

3597
04:34:45,033 --> 04:34:47,157
and to do the pull request

3598
04:34:47,157 --> 04:34:49,200
what you do is like you go

3599
04:34:49,200 --> 04:34:51,604
to the main branch to the code

3600
04:34:51,604 --> 04:34:53,828
and then here you can see the contribute

3601
04:34:53,828 --> 04:34:55,491
and then you can look for

3602
04:34:55,491 --> 04:34:58,816
the open pull request so that's

3603
04:34:58,816 --> 04:35:00,860
uh this is the exercise you are

3604
04:35:00,860 --> 04:35:03,404
now you will be doing now so

3605
04:35:03,404 --> 04:35:07,030
we have uh say uh maybe

3606
04:35:07,030 --> 04:35:08,673
[name] how many minutes like i

3607
04:35:08,673 --> 04:35:10,095
think we are running out of time

3608
04:35:12,725 --> 04:35:15,829
Uh, say 10 minutes so that

3609
04:35:15,829 --> 04:35:19,775
we have, uh, uh, yeah, say 10 50.

3610
04:35:19,775 --> 04:35:21,076
Yeah.

3611
04:35:21,076 --> 04:35:23,640
I can't hear you.

3612
04:35:23,640 --> 04:35:25,382
So this exercise, uh, human,

3613
04:35:25,382 --> 04:35:26,744
you had to walk through because

3614
04:35:26,744 --> 04:35:30,529
of, um, yeah, so they can do it as homework.

3615
04:35:30,529 --> 04:35:31,731
You could walk through.

3616
04:35:31,731 --> 04:35:31,891
Yeah.

3617
04:35:31,891 --> 04:35:34,234
So then I will walk through this exercise.

3618
04:35:34,234 --> 04:35:34,615
Okay.

3619
04:35:34,615 --> 04:35:36,798
Basically, uh, what you see

3620
04:35:36,798 --> 04:35:39,862
here is like, uh, I created a new recipe here.

3621
04:35:39,862 --> 04:35:40,082
Okay.

3622
04:35:41,648 --> 04:35:44,050
So when you click on the new recipe,

3623
04:35:45,152 --> 04:35:48,235
what you next do is like

3624
04:35:48,235 --> 04:35:50,257
a click on this contribute button.

3625
04:35:50,257 --> 04:35:52,099
When you click on this contribute button,

3626
04:35:52,099 --> 04:35:53,440
you can then request for

3627
04:35:53,440 --> 04:35:54,561
the open pull request.

3628
04:35:55,622 --> 04:35:57,644
So if you click on this green button,

3629
04:35:57,644 --> 04:35:59,686
which is open pull request,

3630
04:35:59,686 --> 04:36:03,811
then it will ask you to fill a few things.

3631
04:36:03,811 --> 04:36:06,033
As [name] mentioned before,

3632
04:36:06,033 --> 04:36:10,477
Basically, we need to choose where to push.

3633
04:36:10,477 --> 04:36:12,479
Here it will be your branch.

3634
04:36:13,480 --> 04:36:16,923
It is my name and my

3635
04:36:16,923 --> 04:36:19,645
recipe book, and then here it

3636
04:36:19,645 --> 04:36:22,007
should be your new recipe.

3637
04:36:22,007 --> 04:36:25,511
Then you can add some comments here,

3638
04:36:25,511 --> 04:36:31,957
add push the new recipe, and

3639
04:36:31,957 --> 04:36:33,918
you can add some description if

3640
04:36:33,918 --> 04:36:35,820
you want, and then create pull request.

3641
04:36:37,977 --> 04:36:39,679
So once you create the

3642
04:36:39,679 --> 04:36:42,382
pull request, it starts checking.

3643
04:36:42,382 --> 04:36:44,224
And if there are no conflicts,

3644
04:36:44,224 --> 04:36:46,406
then you can basically just

3645
04:36:46,406 --> 04:36:48,268
do the merging part.

3646
04:36:48,268 --> 04:36:50,691
Okay.

3647
04:36:50,691 --> 04:36:52,793
And here you can also just

3648
04:36:52,793 --> 04:36:58,199
write a new recipe.

3649
04:36:58,199 --> 04:36:59,160
Okay.

3650
04:36:59,160 --> 04:37:00,542
And then just do a confirm.

3651
04:37:06,614 --> 04:37:10,399
And once you merge the pull

3652
04:37:10,399 --> 04:37:11,940
request, if you want, you

3653
04:37:11,940 --> 04:37:12,962
can delete the branch.

3654
04:37:12,962 --> 04:37:17,848
OK, or else you can leave it.

3655
04:37:17,848 --> 04:37:18,969
It's up to you.

3656
04:37:18,969 --> 04:37:20,751
And let me go quickly to

3657
04:37:20,751 --> 04:37:23,955
the code and see what are the branches created.

3658
04:37:23,955 --> 04:37:24,436
OK.

3659
04:37:25,437 --> 04:37:27,580
So you can again go to the code

3660
04:37:27,580 --> 04:37:29,722
and look into these branches

3661
04:37:29,722 --> 04:37:31,544
using this fork button.

3662
04:37:31,544 --> 04:37:33,407
And then here you can see.

3663
04:37:34,908 --> 04:37:35,774
OK.

3664
04:37:35,774 --> 04:37:37,195
Yeah.

3665
04:37:37,195 --> 04:37:38,737
One thing is, even if we

3666
04:37:38,737 --> 04:37:40,379
decide to delete the branch,

3667
04:37:40,379 --> 04:37:42,901
the commits, that branch will remain.

3668
04:37:42,901 --> 04:37:44,202
It's just that point for

3669
04:37:44,202 --> 04:37:45,864
that branch disappeared.

3670
04:37:45,864 --> 04:37:47,686
All the commits would remain

3671
04:37:47,686 --> 04:37:48,407
if it is merged.

3672
04:37:49,768 --> 04:37:50,068
Okay.

3673
04:37:51,089 --> 04:37:52,631
So, yeah.

3674
04:37:52,631 --> 04:37:53,852
What is next, [name]?

3675
04:37:53,852 --> 04:37:55,334
Is there anything?

3676
04:37:55,334 --> 04:37:56,575
What we can do is, while

3677
04:37:56,575 --> 04:37:58,937
we wait a little bit, we have about, I mean,

3678
04:37:58,937 --> 04:38:00,519
like five minutes, we can

3679
04:38:00,519 --> 04:38:02,681
stay and see whether we can

3680
04:38:02,681 --> 04:38:06,453
ask the learners to try it out, the merging.

3681
04:38:06,453 --> 04:38:08,516
not necessarily go out for exercise,

3682
04:38:08,516 --> 04:38:10,639
but we can see while you

3683
04:38:10,639 --> 04:38:12,261
browse, ask them to merge and

3684
04:38:12,261 --> 04:38:14,805
ask questions if they have, or

3685
04:38:14,805 --> 04:38:16,988
if they feel any, face any difficulty.

3686
04:38:18,451 --> 04:38:20,674
Sorry, I lost you for a while.

3687
04:38:20,674 --> 04:38:21,315
Okay.

3688
04:38:21,315 --> 04:38:21,535
Yeah.

3689
04:38:21,535 --> 04:38:22,476
So I would recommend that

3690
04:38:22,476 --> 04:38:24,599
maybe the learners, the

3691
04:38:24,599 --> 04:38:25,781
participants could also try to

3692
04:38:25,781 --> 04:38:27,924
merge and see where they face any issues.

3693
04:38:27,924 --> 04:38:28,906
If they face an issue, then

3694
04:38:28,906 --> 04:38:30,668
maybe you can show how to

3695
04:38:30,668 --> 04:38:32,980
solve it on the screen.

3696
04:38:32,980 --> 04:38:35,002
Okay, fine.

3697
04:38:35,002 --> 04:38:36,204
Someone is asking, what is

3698
04:38:36,204 --> 04:38:37,986
the history behind a pull request?

3699
04:38:37,986 --> 04:38:39,387
Why not merge request instead

3700
04:38:39,387 --> 04:38:42,531
of because of direction seems makes sense.

3701
04:38:42,531 --> 04:38:43,512
So this pull request,

3702
04:38:43,512 --> 04:38:45,474
merge request, there's actually a platform.

3703
04:38:45,474 --> 04:38:46,796
So those are not like

3704
04:38:46,796 --> 04:38:48,918
fundamentally Git stuff.

3705
04:38:48,918 --> 04:38:51,041
For example, it's named

3706
04:38:51,041 --> 04:38:52,863
differently in GitLab, for example.

3707
04:38:52,863 --> 04:38:54,725
So GitHub, GitLab, they use

3708
04:38:54,725 --> 04:38:57,228
different terms sometimes.

3709
04:38:57,228 --> 04:38:58,530
But what it means is to

3710
04:38:58,530 --> 04:39:01,553
integrate with the main line of work.

3711
04:39:04,537 --> 04:39:08,844
Um, so if you see a conflict, um,

3712
04:39:08,844 --> 04:39:12,550
that also, uh, like if you, um, um,

3713
04:39:12,550 --> 04:39:13,912
[name], could you show that,

3714
04:39:13,912 --> 04:39:16,256
um, uh, that picture with

3715
04:39:16,256 --> 04:39:17,298
that sunglass and hats?

3716
04:39:18,319 --> 04:39:18,600
Okay.

3717
04:39:18,600 --> 04:39:21,825
And that's in the rosin, right?

3718
04:39:23,107 --> 04:39:24,269
Um, yes.

3719
04:39:24,269 --> 04:39:25,310
The.

3720
04:39:25,310 --> 04:39:25,631
Oh, sorry.

3721
04:39:25,631 --> 04:39:26,432
Motivation.

3722
04:39:28,736 --> 04:39:30,038
Uh, maybe one before.

3723
04:39:32,718 --> 04:39:34,102
Yeah, here.

3724
04:39:34,102 --> 04:39:36,588
So here, if instead of the sunglass,

3725
04:39:36,588 --> 04:39:38,032
if you are trying a red

3726
04:39:38,032 --> 04:39:40,498
hat and a black hat, then

3727
04:39:40,498 --> 04:39:42,082
when you are combining it, it

3728
04:39:42,082 --> 04:39:44,107
might not know automatically how to combine it.

3729
04:39:45,049 --> 04:39:48,901
So then a human is needed to decide.

3730
04:39:48,901 --> 04:39:50,343
here because it's a sunglass and

3731
04:39:50,343 --> 04:39:52,566
a hat it just combined so if it is this

3732
04:39:52,566 --> 04:39:53,968
for example if two people

3733
04:39:53,968 --> 04:39:56,772
um modify the same line of

3734
04:39:56,772 --> 04:39:59,336
code then git won't know which

3735
04:39:59,336 --> 04:40:02,380
one to keep because if it takes one

3736
04:40:02,380 --> 04:40:03,421
and discard the other there's

3737
04:40:03,421 --> 04:40:05,304
a loss of information so as

3738
04:40:05,304 --> 04:40:08,020
long as there's no loss of information

3739
04:40:08,020 --> 04:40:09,542
it'll do automatically.

3740
04:40:09,542 --> 04:40:10,944
But as soon as there's

3741
04:40:10,944 --> 04:40:13,607
a possibility of losing information,

3742
04:40:13,607 --> 04:40:15,710
it'll ask the intervention of a human.

3743
04:40:15,710 --> 04:40:17,071
So that we call a conflict.

3744
04:40:18,533 --> 04:40:21,577
So the conflict, there's a kind

3745
04:40:21,577 --> 04:40:22,918
of a demo here as well.

3746
04:40:23,800 --> 04:40:26,903
At the end, I think, let

3747
04:40:26,903 --> 04:40:28,786
me check in the merging part.

3748
04:40:32,310 --> 04:40:34,493
If you go further down,

3749
04:40:35,294 --> 04:40:36,255
it's all in conflict.

3750
04:40:37,096 --> 04:40:38,057
in the in the in the

3751
04:40:38,057 --> 04:40:39,319
in the document that you are showing.

3752
04:40:42,625 --> 04:40:44,748
So yeah, so in the in the yeah,

3753
04:40:44,748 --> 04:40:46,851
so in the in the in the as an example,

3754
04:40:46,851 --> 04:40:49,095
there's one example in the same lesson

3755
04:40:49,095 --> 04:40:50,016
that you are showing before

3756
04:40:50,016 --> 04:40:52,820
in the merging changes and

3757
04:40:52,820 --> 04:40:54,223
contributing to the project lesson.

3758
04:40:58,069 --> 04:40:59,371
Yeah.

3759
04:40:59,371 --> 04:41:01,534
So okay, let's go there then.

3760
04:41:03,556 --> 04:41:04,517
So at the end, there's a

3761
04:41:04,517 --> 04:41:08,282
simple example for demonstrating a conflict.

3762
04:41:17,315 --> 04:41:19,097
Resolving conflicts and demonstration.

3763
04:41:19,097 --> 04:41:22,081
It's a demonstration, but I

3764
04:41:22,081 --> 04:41:24,124
don't think we have time

3765
04:41:24,124 --> 04:41:25,506
for that demonstration, but I

3766
04:41:25,506 --> 04:41:28,670
think we'll talk about it later

3767
04:41:28,670 --> 04:41:31,774
on as well in the lessons when we...

3768
04:41:33,323 --> 04:41:36,626
especially when we entertain

3769
04:41:36,626 --> 04:41:38,728
pooled requests from different users.

3770
04:41:38,728 --> 04:41:43,672
So a conflict is mainly when

3771
04:41:43,672 --> 04:41:44,893
Git want to combine two

3772
04:41:44,893 --> 04:41:47,475
things from two different, like

3773
04:41:47,475 --> 04:41:49,777
combine two different branches and

3774
04:41:49,777 --> 04:41:51,899
the file that it's trying to

3775
04:41:51,899 --> 04:41:53,941
combine has been modified on the

3776
04:41:53,941 --> 04:41:56,684
same line that by two different people.

3777
04:41:56,684 --> 04:42:01,828
So it's to avoid loss of information.

3778
04:42:03,580 --> 04:42:05,662
Okay, now let's go for the

3779
04:42:05,662 --> 04:42:07,605
day two, like the preparation for the day two.

3780
04:42:08,546 --> 04:42:08,846
Okay.

3781
04:42:08,846 --> 04:42:11,209
I think, yeah, since we are

3782
04:42:11,209 --> 04:42:12,030
at the last 10 minutes.

3783
04:42:12,931 --> 04:42:14,613
Yeah, should I share my

3784
04:42:14,613 --> 04:42:15,354
screen in that case?

3785
04:42:16,255 --> 04:42:20,800
I think if you want, you can just... Yes.

3786
04:42:20,800 --> 04:42:22,502
Yeah, I don't know.

3787
04:42:22,502 --> 04:42:24,024
I'm sharing my screen now.

3788
04:42:24,024 --> 04:42:25,266
We can show my one.

3789
04:42:32,414 --> 04:42:33,432
Sorry, it's not.

3790
04:42:33,432 --> 04:42:36,115
It will not show up correctly if, okay.

3791
04:42:36,115 --> 04:42:37,016
So now there's only one

3792
04:42:37,016 --> 04:42:41,622
person sharing and I can set it to here.

3793
04:42:43,925 --> 04:42:44,526
Yes, okay.

3794
04:42:44,526 --> 04:42:46,047
Got it showing correctly.

3795
04:42:46,047 --> 04:42:46,948
All right.

3796
04:42:46,948 --> 04:42:47,389
Yeah.

3797
04:42:47,389 --> 04:42:49,431
So while I'm talking that, Erno

3798
04:42:49,431 --> 04:42:51,314
and [name], that it's also

3799
04:42:51,314 --> 04:42:52,415
important that you give us

3800
04:42:52,415 --> 04:42:56,019
some feedback about how the day was.

3801
04:42:56,019 --> 04:42:58,002
So please do that as well.

3802
04:42:59,243 --> 04:43:00,185
And then I'll give you

3803
04:43:00,185 --> 04:43:02,207
some details about the,

3804
04:43:03,503 --> 04:43:08,348
next lesson um tomorrow we'll

3805
04:43:08,348 --> 04:43:10,730
be doing most realistic stuff

3806
04:43:10,730 --> 04:43:11,832
so today we worked on the

3807
04:43:11,832 --> 04:43:14,995
browser this is not necessarily the

3808
04:43:14,995 --> 04:43:17,598
way we work because um when

3809
04:43:17,598 --> 04:43:18,679
you have code you have to

3810
04:43:18,679 --> 04:43:20,060
work on the terminal or

3811
04:43:20,060 --> 04:43:22,322
on an integrated development

3812
04:43:22,322 --> 04:43:24,324
um environment like you know vs

3813
04:43:24,324 --> 04:43:26,447
code or so there are so

3814
04:43:26,447 --> 04:43:28,869
many environments for this you need

3815
04:43:28,869 --> 04:43:33,355
to um do certain things by tomorrow

3816
04:43:33,355 --> 04:43:34,436
First thing is that to

3817
04:43:34,436 --> 04:43:35,898
create a GitHub account that

3818
04:43:35,898 --> 04:43:38,582
you have already done, and then

3819
04:43:39,523 --> 04:43:42,347
you have to configure the Git a little bit.

3820
04:43:43,448 --> 04:43:44,750
Some, you know, you have to

3821
04:43:44,750 --> 04:43:48,715
inform Git your name and information like that.

3822
04:43:49,597 --> 04:43:51,900
Let me go down here and

3823
04:43:51,900 --> 04:43:53,762
point you to where that information is.

3824
04:43:55,504 --> 04:43:57,507
Configuring Git command line editor.

3825
04:43:58,735 --> 04:44:00,097
So now I'm going to pull

3826
04:44:00,097 --> 04:44:02,200
up a terminal like today, the

3827
04:44:02,200 --> 04:44:03,122
first time I'm going to pull

3828
04:44:03,122 --> 04:44:06,907
this up and then I'm going to

3829
04:44:06,907 --> 04:44:12,876
show you the way it should be configured.

3830
04:44:14,198 --> 04:44:15,681
So in the git terminal, so

3831
04:44:15,681 --> 04:44:17,343
you see my terminal now, maybe

3832
04:44:17,343 --> 04:44:18,445
I make the font a little

3833
04:44:18,445 --> 04:44:22,191
bit bigger and maybe make it

3834
04:44:22,191 --> 04:44:26,397
a little lighter, even lighter maybe.

3835
04:44:28,942 --> 04:44:32,567
yes the first thing you need is git

3836
04:44:32,567 --> 04:44:33,769
so you should when you type

3837
04:44:33,769 --> 04:44:37,414
git version it should print something

3838
04:44:38,355 --> 04:44:41,660
so i have 241 so any any version

3839
04:44:41,660 --> 04:44:42,541
that close by should be

3840
04:44:42,541 --> 04:44:45,105
okay the other thing you need

3841
04:44:45,105 --> 04:44:52,215
is when you type ssh version

3842
04:44:54,608 --> 04:44:56,150
that should print something but

3843
04:44:56,150 --> 04:44:57,071
that's not how you type the

3844
04:44:57,071 --> 04:44:57,832
value you have to type a

3845
04:44:57,832 --> 04:44:59,875
capital V here it should

3846
04:44:59,875 --> 04:45:01,798
print something not like command

3847
04:45:01,798 --> 04:45:06,244
not found then the next command

3848
04:45:06,244 --> 04:45:08,126
is to see whether you can

3849
04:45:08,126 --> 04:45:15,396
connect to GitHub GitHub.com so

3850
04:45:15,396 --> 04:45:17,359
the first one is to check the version of git

3851
04:45:18,875 --> 04:45:21,919
Second one is to SSH, whether you have SSH.

3852
04:45:21,919 --> 04:45:23,040
Normally you have it on

3853
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:25,182
Windows, you have it in the

3854
04:45:25,182 --> 04:45:26,804
PowerShell and even the terminal you have it.

3855
04:45:27,805 --> 04:45:30,609
And then what you do is with

3856
04:45:30,609 --> 04:45:31,830
a capital T to see whether

3857
04:45:31,830 --> 04:45:34,393
you can connect to github.com.

3858
04:45:34,393 --> 04:45:36,015
The first time when you issue

3859
04:45:36,015 --> 04:45:37,317
that command, it will ask, it

3860
04:45:37,317 --> 04:45:38,958
will tell you that you are

3861
04:45:38,958 --> 04:45:40,881
going to connect to something that

3862
04:45:40,881 --> 04:45:42,763
you are never connected before.

3863
04:45:42,763 --> 04:45:43,684
Do you trust that?

3864
04:45:44,710 --> 04:45:45,652
So if you had typed

3865
04:45:45,652 --> 04:45:48,476
the address correctly, github.com,

3866
04:45:48,476 --> 04:45:49,358
then you should trust that.

3867
04:45:50,980 --> 04:45:52,703
And you could also cross-check

3868
04:45:52,703 --> 04:45:54,386
this hash with GitHub if you want.

3869
04:45:56,088 --> 04:45:58,272
Then it says permission denied.

3870
04:45:58,272 --> 04:45:59,874
So this is the most likely

3871
04:45:59,874 --> 04:46:02,258
case that you will get if you

3872
04:46:02,258 --> 04:46:04,262
have not used Git before.

3873
04:46:05,443 --> 04:46:06,826
Because I have been using Git

3874
04:46:07,687 --> 04:46:09,750
and I have configured it, if I

3875
04:46:09,750 --> 04:46:10,752
use it on my laptop,

3876
04:46:14,275 --> 04:46:18,781
github.com sorry not git ssh

3877
04:46:22,466 --> 04:46:27,413
ssh it would return that okay

3878
04:46:28,655 --> 04:46:34,263
still public is not accepted so when you

3879
04:46:34,263 --> 04:46:38,529
when you get this message

3880
04:46:38,529 --> 04:46:40,131
the thing you should do is

3881
04:46:40,131 --> 04:46:43,776
mentioned here you have to go and set up

3882
04:46:45,005 --> 04:46:47,849
SSH key pair.

3883
04:46:48,790 --> 04:46:50,873
So what this basically do

3884
04:46:50,873 --> 04:46:54,878
is that there's some credentials

3885
04:46:54,878 --> 04:46:58,483
in your computer that you

3886
04:46:58,483 --> 04:46:59,544
create some credentials, we

3887
04:46:59,544 --> 04:47:00,285
call the certificate.

3888
04:47:01,186 --> 04:47:03,970
And you place that in GitHub.

3889
04:47:03,970 --> 04:47:06,013
And whenever you reach GitHub,

3890
04:47:06,013 --> 04:47:07,415
GitHub knows that it is you.

3891
04:47:08,336 --> 04:47:09,658
So let me try with this

3892
04:47:09,658 --> 04:47:11,440
command again with the git

3893
04:47:11,440 --> 04:47:12,882
task username, because it went

3894
04:47:12,882 --> 04:47:13,763
with my username.

3895
04:47:15,228 --> 04:47:21,174
github.com task my uh need

3896
04:47:21,174 --> 04:47:26,539
to unlock then if you if

3897
04:47:26,539 --> 04:47:27,980
you had configured it you had to

3898
04:47:27,980 --> 04:47:29,541
be you get this message as

3899
04:47:29,541 --> 04:47:31,403
successful i'll just do it again

3900
04:47:31,403 --> 04:47:32,524
in my virtual machine which

3901
04:47:32,524 --> 04:47:33,826
is not configured to get

3902
04:47:33,826 --> 04:47:39,851
the correct message what's this

3903
04:47:41,393 --> 04:47:43,935
then it should say public key it says denied

3904
04:47:45,502 --> 04:47:48,466
So by tomorrow, you should be

3905
04:47:48,466 --> 04:47:52,471
able to issue this command and be

3906
04:47:52,471 --> 04:47:54,173
able to get a successful authentication.

3907
04:47:55,334 --> 04:47:58,177
How to do that is explained here.

3908
04:48:01,542 --> 04:48:02,763
So installation instructions,

3909
04:48:02,763 --> 04:48:04,325
how to create a key and

3910
04:48:04,325 --> 04:48:06,628
what that is, what this means.

3911
04:48:08,530 --> 04:48:10,392
I hope that you could do

3912
04:48:10,392 --> 04:48:13,177
this today and make sure that

3913
04:48:13,177 --> 04:48:15,480
you are ready for tomorrow's

3914
04:48:15,480 --> 04:48:19,085
workshop um did that explain him

3915
04:48:19,085 --> 04:48:20,187
or should i explain a little

3916
04:48:20,187 --> 04:48:22,610
bit more no that is good

3917
04:48:22,610 --> 04:48:25,414
actually uh there will be i'm

3918
04:48:25,414 --> 04:48:26,936
just looking at the note

3919
04:48:26,936 --> 04:48:29,580
uh notebook basically there is

3920
04:48:29,580 --> 04:48:31,382
an installation help available on

3921
04:48:31,382 --> 04:48:34,206
zoom zoom one hour before

3922
04:48:34,206 --> 04:48:37,050
for oslo so basically more

3923
04:48:37,050 --> 04:48:39,934
details will be followed like uh

3924
04:48:39,934 --> 04:48:40,876
and you will receive any

3925
04:48:40,876 --> 04:48:41,817
email regarding this so

3926
04:48:43,062 --> 04:48:45,385
Good.

3927
04:48:45,385 --> 04:48:48,268
So, will the learners will

3928
04:48:48,268 --> 04:48:49,529
get an email about this?

3929
04:48:53,453 --> 04:48:55,656
I guess, yeah.

3930
04:48:55,656 --> 04:48:56,457
We'll try to.

3931
04:48:57,257 --> 04:48:57,878
Try to, yes.

3932
04:48:57,878 --> 04:48:59,240
So, basically, what you try to

3933
04:48:59,240 --> 04:49:04,205
do is to follow the instructions here.

3934
04:49:04,205 --> 04:49:05,907
So, when you issue this

3935
04:49:05,907 --> 04:49:08,630
command, ssh dash capital T

3936
04:49:08,630 --> 04:49:12,394
GitHub, git at github.com, it should

3937
04:49:14,045 --> 04:49:15,667
get you into a place where

3938
04:49:15,667 --> 04:49:17,971
it says it was successful.

3939
04:49:17,971 --> 04:49:18,371
Yeah.

3940
04:49:18,371 --> 04:49:20,094
Shall we take the notebook then?

3941
04:49:20,094 --> 04:49:22,297
Like the final questions?

3942
04:49:22,297 --> 04:49:22,737
Yes.

3943
04:49:22,737 --> 04:49:24,199
So we'll go for the final questions.

3944
04:49:28,485 --> 04:49:29,587
Can you comment on your

3945
04:49:29,587 --> 04:49:31,830
GitHub desktop versus VS Code command?

3946
04:49:32,751 --> 04:49:33,072
Yeah.

3947
04:49:33,072 --> 04:49:36,036
So, so the,

3948
04:49:40,268 --> 04:49:42,791
mean if you can go for

3949
04:49:42,791 --> 04:49:45,014
the command line vs code or the terminal

3950
04:49:45,014 --> 04:49:47,036
or any other command line

3951
04:49:48,097 --> 04:49:51,582
you get more transparent outputs

3952
04:49:51,582 --> 04:49:54,645
when you do git and you can do more steps

3953
04:49:54,645 --> 04:49:55,967
for example when you when you

3954
04:49:55,967 --> 04:49:57,128
want to make a commit you

3955
04:49:57,128 --> 04:49:59,171
could commit like git add to

3956
04:49:59,171 --> 04:50:01,073
collect all the relevant commits

3957
04:50:01,073 --> 04:50:03,860
into one place and then git push

3958
04:50:03,860 --> 04:50:05,382
Git commit.

3959
04:50:05,382 --> 04:50:09,088
But in the GitHub interface,

3960
04:50:09,088 --> 04:50:10,771
most things are not that transparent.

3961
04:50:14,617 --> 04:50:17,662
So the close commit, so this is, I mean,

3962
04:50:17,662 --> 04:50:20,927
when you have merge request and then

3963
04:50:20,927 --> 04:50:22,810
when you say close the

3964
04:50:22,810 --> 04:50:24,072
merge request without merging,

3965
04:50:24,072 --> 04:50:25,763
which means that

3966
04:50:25,763 --> 04:50:27,866
that the changes in that

3967
04:50:27,866 --> 04:50:30,090
branch would not be merged,

3968
04:50:30,090 --> 04:50:31,031
which not be integrated.

3969
04:50:31,031 --> 04:50:32,674
It will remain in the branch.

3970
04:50:32,674 --> 04:50:34,536
But if that branch is deleted, then

3971
04:50:34,536 --> 04:50:35,638
that commit, that change

3972
04:50:35,638 --> 04:50:37,241
is disappeared, that gone forever.

3973
04:50:38,082 --> 04:50:40,285
But after it merged without

3974
04:50:40,285 --> 04:50:42,388
closing, if you delete it, it will not go away.

3975
04:50:44,111 --> 04:50:44,351
Okay.

3976
04:50:46,875 --> 04:50:47,096
Yeah.

3977
04:50:47,096 --> 04:50:49,339
So this conflict, we didn't go

3978
04:50:49,339 --> 04:50:50,461
through too much today about

3979
04:50:50,461 --> 04:50:51,923
the conflict because of the

3980
04:50:52,730 --> 04:50:54,512
the complexity of like, we want

3981
04:50:54,512 --> 04:50:56,073
to make it very least complex today.

3982
04:50:57,815 --> 04:50:58,836
Um, but that is some

3983
04:50:58,836 --> 04:51:00,657
natural thing that you'll encounter.

3984
04:51:00,657 --> 04:51:02,179
If two people modify the same

3985
04:51:02,179 --> 04:51:04,301
line of a file, for example,

3986
04:51:04,301 --> 04:51:06,403
or, uh, you modify the same line

3987
04:51:06,403 --> 04:51:08,505
of a file in different branches,

3988
04:51:08,505 --> 04:51:10,767
Git would ask your help to select what to keep.

3989
04:51:14,330 --> 04:51:14,570
Yeah.

3990
04:51:14,570 --> 04:51:15,911
Anything else, [name], that you

3991
04:51:15,911 --> 04:51:17,132
need to mention before we close?

3992
04:51:17,973 --> 04:51:18,093
Yeah.

3993
04:51:18,093 --> 04:51:19,935
Should we move to the, um,

3994
04:51:21,974 --> 04:51:23,476
to the close, basically.

3995
04:51:23,476 --> 04:51:28,342
So yeah, it's a couple of

3996
04:51:28,342 --> 04:51:29,704
things in the end of the notes.

3997
04:51:29,704 --> 04:51:31,366
The most important thing is

3998
04:51:31,366 --> 04:51:32,848
the feedback section.

3999
04:51:32,848 --> 04:51:34,310
So yeah, please do give us

4000
04:51:34,310 --> 04:51:35,992
feedback for how this day went.

4001
04:51:37,394 --> 04:51:38,836
There's some standard questions

4002
04:51:38,836 --> 04:51:39,657
we always ask.

4003
04:51:40,798 --> 04:51:43,882
If it was too fast, too slow, just right.

4004
04:51:44,763 --> 04:51:46,165
And we'll try to adjust.

4005
04:51:47,247 --> 04:51:48,518
And...

4006
04:51:48,518 --> 04:51:50,821
Well, let's take a look at

4007
04:51:50,821 --> 04:51:51,742
those in a moment.

4008
04:51:51,742 --> 04:51:53,625
But first, news.

4009
04:51:53,625 --> 04:51:55,508
So if you scroll a little bit up,

4010
04:51:55,508 --> 04:51:57,971
there's an info section, a

4011
04:51:57,971 --> 04:52:00,375
blue box with news on it.

4012
04:52:00,375 --> 04:52:01,096
Scroll a little bit up.

4013
04:52:02,698 --> 04:52:04,400
I could, of course, also move

4014
04:52:04,400 --> 04:52:07,124
to the notes that I have

4015
04:52:07,124 --> 04:52:09,467
on the broadcaster computer.

4016
04:52:09,467 --> 04:52:10,449
But okay.

4017
04:52:10,449 --> 04:52:13,333
So yeah, there were basics of Git today.

4018
04:52:13,333 --> 04:52:15,375
We covered GitHub, mostly using

4019
04:52:15,375 --> 04:52:16,970
GitHub user interface.

4020
04:52:16,970 --> 04:52:20,373
tomorrow we'll move to your local computer.

4021
04:52:20,373 --> 04:52:24,637
So if today was either like

4022
04:52:24,637 --> 04:52:30,243
too much GitHub or too abstract or too easy,

4023
04:52:31,884 --> 04:52:33,746
don't worry, tomorrow you'll do

4024
04:52:33,746 --> 04:52:35,768
more work on your own computer.

4025
04:52:37,250 --> 04:52:38,211
But it should not be

4026
04:52:38,211 --> 04:52:39,412
that much more complicated.

4027
04:52:39,412 --> 04:52:40,433
So we're kind of doing these

4028
04:52:40,433 --> 04:52:43,355
steps also to prepare so that

4029
04:52:43,355 --> 04:52:46,788
a lot of the concepts are familiar tomorrow.

4030
04:52:46,788 --> 04:52:50,133
But yeah, so tomorrow we'll

4031
04:52:50,133 --> 04:52:53,057
move on more working on your own computer.

4032
04:52:53,057 --> 04:52:54,158
And that also does mean

4033
04:52:54,158 --> 04:52:57,523
either the terminal or VS Code or similar.

4034
04:52:58,744 --> 04:53:01,007
So if you haven't already,

4035
04:53:01,007 --> 04:53:02,609
please check the installation instructions.

4036
04:53:03,751 --> 04:53:05,674
Okay, so it really should

4037
04:53:05,674 --> 04:53:07,616
be exciting tomorrow because it

4038
04:53:07,616 --> 04:53:10,300
will then directly apply to

4039
04:53:10,300 --> 04:53:13,644
your current work, to your

4040
04:53:13,644 --> 04:53:16,775
coding and paper writing and so on.

4041
04:53:16,775 --> 04:53:17,596
on your own computer.

4042
04:53:19,258 --> 04:53:21,360
Okay, if you have issues,

4043
04:53:21,360 --> 04:53:22,261
yeah, there will be already

4044
04:53:22,261 --> 04:53:25,485
mentioned the support, zoom

4045
04:53:25,485 --> 04:53:27,487
or installation help.

4046
04:53:27,487 --> 04:53:30,430
Another good thing to know is

4047
04:53:30,430 --> 04:53:31,712
that Twitch will store this

4048
04:53:31,712 --> 04:53:33,834
video for seven days.

4049
04:53:33,834 --> 04:53:35,376
So you can come back and

4050
04:53:35,376 --> 04:53:39,080
take a look at well, any part

4051
04:53:39,080 --> 04:53:41,282
that you felt like it went too fast.

4052
04:53:42,223 --> 04:53:44,500
Anything that was

4053
04:53:44,500 --> 04:53:46,262
complicated, you can try to

4054
04:53:46,262 --> 04:53:48,225
do the exercises again, when

4055
04:53:48,225 --> 04:53:50,347
maybe GitHub has less load and

4056
04:53:50,347 --> 04:53:51,829
some of the or some of the

4057
04:53:51,829 --> 04:53:53,070
other issues might be resolved.

4058
04:53:54,052 --> 04:53:57,616
And yeah, then it will be on YouTube.

4059
04:53:57,616 --> 04:53:58,637
So all of our old

4060
04:53:58,637 --> 04:54:01,741
workshops, these online workshops

4061
04:54:01,741 --> 04:54:02,722
that are streamed, they will

4062
04:54:02,722 --> 04:54:05,225
also be okay, they are already also on YouTube.

4063
04:54:05,225 --> 04:54:08,509
So you can go see the same things

4064
04:54:08,509 --> 04:54:09,590
or similar things explained

4065
04:54:09,590 --> 04:54:11,773
by different people in different ways.

4066
04:54:11,773 --> 04:54:14,639
If so, hopefully, that's helpful.

4067
04:54:14,639 --> 04:54:17,883
Um, and then, yeah, so I

4068
04:54:17,883 --> 04:54:19,185
mentioned to do tomorrow, we'll

4069
04:54:19,185 --> 04:54:20,566
move to your own computer and

4070
04:54:20,566 --> 04:54:21,828
on day three, then we'll

4071
04:54:21,828 --> 04:54:24,351
move more to collaborating with people.

4072
04:54:24,351 --> 04:54:26,013
So sharing the code and working

4073
04:54:26,013 --> 04:54:29,297
on the same project and, uh,

4074
04:54:29,297 --> 04:54:31,439
also we'll see more conflicts

4075
04:54:31,439 --> 04:54:32,761
and resolve conflicts.

4076
04:54:33,702 --> 04:54:36,005
So, um, that should be interesting.

4077
04:54:38,047 --> 04:54:38,588
Okay.

4078
04:54:38,588 --> 04:54:41,912
Uh, let's take a look at the, um,

4079
04:54:43,715 --> 04:54:44,837
the feedback a bit more.

4080
04:54:46,279 --> 04:54:50,365
There are a lot of votes on write speed,

4081
04:54:50,365 --> 04:54:51,466
a few votes on too

4082
04:54:51,466 --> 04:54:53,429
slow, too fast sometimes,

4083
04:54:55,272 --> 04:54:57,775
which means essentially we need

4084
04:54:57,775 --> 04:54:58,416
to pay attention.

4085
04:55:00,499 --> 04:55:02,062
But at least it's an average good.

4086
04:55:04,085 --> 04:55:06,268
Some on write level, some on too basic.

4087
04:55:07,610 --> 04:55:09,753
Tomorrow will be a bit more advanced.

4088
04:55:09,753 --> 04:55:11,194
So if you're starting with

4089
04:55:11,194 --> 04:55:13,157
already knowing some Git, then

4090
04:55:13,157 --> 04:55:17,081
maybe today was not that much

4091
04:55:17,081 --> 04:55:20,364
new stuff, but tomorrow should be more.

4092
04:55:22,426 --> 04:55:23,507
So, but yeah, people are

4093
04:55:23,507 --> 04:55:26,250
saying they will use what they learned today,

4094
04:55:26,250 --> 04:55:27,812
which is really good to hear,

4095
04:55:28,953 --> 04:55:31,075
and that they would recommend for others.

4096
04:55:31,075 --> 04:55:31,996
So that's nice.

4097
04:55:31,996 --> 04:55:33,818
So let's see what specific,

4098
04:55:33,818 --> 04:55:38,663
what catches your eye, [name], [name].

4099
04:55:41,090 --> 04:55:43,333
somebody accidentally asked to

4100
04:55:43,333 --> 04:55:45,215
brand merge their branch with mine.

4101
04:55:45,215 --> 04:55:46,417
So I think I made a new friend.

4102
04:55:46,417 --> 04:55:47,738
That's nice to hear.

4103
04:55:47,738 --> 04:55:50,602
Yeah.

4104
04:55:50,602 --> 04:55:51,603
And yeah, to collaborate

4105
04:55:51,603 --> 04:55:52,765
document, we always like that.

4106
04:55:53,746 --> 04:55:57,851
Okay, somebody is calling

4107
04:55:57,851 --> 04:55:59,053
the stream professional, which is

4108
04:55:59,053 --> 04:56:00,615
nice for me to hear because I

4109
04:56:00,615 --> 04:56:01,536
made a lot of mistakes.

4110
04:56:02,898 --> 04:56:04,920
But it wasn't that bad.

4111
04:56:06,042 --> 04:56:10,067
Yeah, the font size was small for a

4112
04:56:11,127 --> 04:56:13,371
for some period of time,

4113
04:56:13,371 --> 04:56:16,617
and we didn't communicate either

4114
04:56:16,617 --> 04:56:17,999
clearly enough or loudly enough

4115
04:56:19,001 --> 04:56:19,823
when it happened.

4116
04:56:19,823 --> 04:56:21,806
So yeah, next time, I

4117
04:56:21,806 --> 04:56:26,234
guess I'll escalate to speaking up and see.

4118
04:56:26,234 --> 04:56:28,057
So because it is like you concentrate

4119
04:56:28,057 --> 04:56:29,139
when I know when I've

4120
04:56:29,139 --> 04:56:30,422
been at the instructor, you

4121
04:56:30,422 --> 04:56:32,265
really, you focus on what

4122
04:56:32,265 --> 04:56:33,747
you're doing, and then you don't

4123
04:56:33,747 --> 04:56:35,290
look at the chat and so on.

4124
04:56:35,290 --> 04:56:36,102
So I

4125
04:56:36,102 --> 04:56:37,604
It was essentially on me,

4126
04:56:37,604 --> 04:56:40,167
I should have spoken up more quickly.

4127
04:56:42,991 --> 04:56:45,895
But yeah, so that's important feedback.

4128
04:56:52,003 --> 04:56:52,403
Okay.

4129
04:56:55,027 --> 04:56:57,029
I think we're done for the end.

4130
04:56:57,029 --> 04:57:00,334
Thank you all the assistance

4131
04:57:00,334 --> 04:57:01,435
from our colleagues to answer

4132
04:57:01,435 --> 04:57:02,056
all the questions.

4133
04:57:02,056 --> 04:57:03,578
It was very well answered as well.

4134
04:57:05,515 --> 04:57:07,618
And thank you, [name], and thank you,

4135
04:57:07,618 --> 04:57:09,660
[name], [name], and everybody

4136
04:57:09,660 --> 04:57:11,923
else, and also the helpers.

4137
04:57:11,923 --> 04:57:13,044
And we'll see you tomorrow.

4138
04:57:13,044 --> 04:57:14,666
I hope you'll come back

4139
04:57:14,666 --> 04:57:19,632
tomorrow to learn more.

4140
04:57:19,632 --> 04:57:21,054
Yeah, tomorrow will be really

4141
04:57:21,054 --> 04:57:24,277
more, even more hands-on.

4142
04:57:24,277 --> 04:57:26,220
It will look more familiar

4143
04:57:26,220 --> 04:57:28,783
compared to what your normal,

4144
04:57:28,783 --> 04:57:30,545
at least, coding workflow is.

4145
04:57:30,545 --> 04:57:32,367
So it should be exciting.

4146
04:57:34,979 --> 04:57:35,920
Thank you all.

4147
04:57:35,920 --> 04:57:37,562
But I do write more feedback

4148
04:57:37,562 --> 04:57:41,507
in that we will read everything right there.

4149
04:57:42,949 --> 04:57:44,450
This is not the end of the workshop.

4150
04:57:44,450 --> 04:57:45,712
And in any case, we're

4151
04:57:45,712 --> 04:57:48,575
interested to know what you have to say.

4152
04:57:50,277 --> 04:57:55,964
Please continue writing in the feedback.

4153
04:57:55,964 --> 04:57:56,325
Okay, then.

4154
04:57:57,186 --> 04:57:57,566
Bye-bye.

4155
04:57:59,168 --> 04:57:59,809
All right.

4156
04:57:59,809 --> 04:58:00,670
Bye.

4157
04:58:00,670 --> 04:58:02,472
See you tomorrow, everyone.
