1
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,774
All right.

2
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:36,057
And here we are live.

3
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:38,801
Very welcome everyone to day

4
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,503
six of the Code Refinery workshop.

5
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,066
How is everyone doing?

6
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:48,694
I had my lunch here in Germany.

7
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:54,662
It's a bit later than in Iceland, I guess.

8
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:58,527
Right.

9
00:11:58,527 --> 00:11:59,668
How about [name]?

10
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:01,656
Yeah, not bad.

11
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:02,257
Had my lunch.

12
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,560
Great.

13
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,521
We are here in the

14
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,824
studio together with [name], our streamer

15
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:12,366
for today and [name] and [name]

16
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,289
who will be teaching today's lesson.

17
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,033
And the next, is it still eight minutes?

18
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:20,774
We're going to have a

19
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,496
little chat here before the

20
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,218
actual workshop starts at the hour

21
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:27,796
to get used to our

22
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,318
ways of working with

23
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:32,263
our collaborative notes and see

24
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,264
what you all had for lunch.

25
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:36,409
And let's also do the audio check now.

26
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:37,451
And all right.

27
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,412
[name]'s already saying that

28
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,754
volumes are fine.

29
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:40,315
Okay.

30
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,541
What's the order that I see people at?

31
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,367
That's me, [name], you and [name].

32
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,350
Let's go in that order.

33
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,853
One, two, three, four.

34
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:53,335
One.

35
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,258
Two.

36
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:55,558
Three.

37
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:56,740
Four.

38
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:02,153
Okay, I think it's roughly the same.

39
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:02,573
All right.

40
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,656
Okay, so what I'm sharing

41
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:08,379
here on the screen is

42
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:10,922
our collaborative notes document.

43
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,443
Every one of you, if you

44
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,966
registered to our workshop, has

45
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:17,128
just, probably just right now,

46
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:19,450
gotten an email with the link

47
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,851
to that document and also

48
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,254
to our workshop webpage and

49
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:24,415
our virtual help room.

50
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:27,337
So this document is used

51
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:30,422
for connecting with the instructors,

52
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:32,486
so that we can connect with you

53
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,949
and you have a bunch of links up here

54
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,912
as well, for example, to

55
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:38,856
our code of conduct general just

56
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:39,817
be nice to one another.

57
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:43,503
And archives and also the

58
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:45,586
schedule is linked from here, and

59
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,808
if we scroll down.

60
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,488
we actually have some

61
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,270
icebreakers for everyone to get

62
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,312
used to this document.

63
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:54,034
So if you've never used

64
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,356
a HedgeDoc document or also

65
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,839
HackMD, it works very similar,

66
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,901
then you will see something

67
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:02,764
like I'm showing here right now.

68
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,627
And if you want to edit

69
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,270
something, you can find the little pen symbol,

70
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,792
which is either where it is

71
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,233
for me right now, up here

72
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,816
to the right, or somewhere here

73
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:15,378
in a group of three.

74
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,720
And if you click that,

75
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,342
you switch to edit mode,

76
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:20,763
then you can scroll down to

77
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:24,087
our icebreaker and add your answer here.

78
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,992
And you can go ahead and do

79
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,393
that now if you want to.

80
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:31,135
So we would like to know

81
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,338
what did you all have for lunch today?

82
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:36,141
Maybe we get some new ideas for tomorrow.

83
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:38,644
How would you explain your

84
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,666
current job to someone in the year 1700s?

85
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,146
That's always fun to see.

86
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:45,928
what people are actually doing.

87
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,350
And maybe we can guess what

88
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,313
what is your current job title.

89
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:56,222
And then related to our today's lesson,

90
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:58,304
what's the best documented project

91
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:58,845
you have seen?

92
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:00,868
So maybe we ask our

93
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,089
instructors first, what did you

94
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,471
have for lunch today, [name]?

95
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,541
Well, I think I was the

96
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,944
one who said some vegan dish.

97
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,468
I had some vegetables, something

98
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:16,694
light to just keep me alive

99
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:18,216
during the next two hours and a half.

100
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:20,899
Sounds good.

101
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,181
Very good, by the way.

102
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,484
Yeah, pretty similar.

103
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:28,389
I had some cucumbers, tomatoes.

104
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:31,753
Yeah, vegan dish.

105
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,329
How about [name]?

106
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,932
Did you have any lunch?

107
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,915
I had breakfast for lunch,

108
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:39,518
I guess, several hours ago.

109
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:43,745
Someone's saying the sound is

110
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:45,288
low in the classroom, even though

111
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,650
they have it on max volume.

112
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,374
So since we haven't started

113
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,838
yet, I'm going to adjust the gain a bit.

114
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,260
Okay.

115
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:55,446
So I hope your ears don't break.

116
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,416
We can continue talking something

117
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,280
to see if it helps.

118
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,682
Now it should be a bit louder.

119
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:08,289
So you can respond in the

120
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:09,631
document to the question.

121
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:12,896
If it's okay or not.

122
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,500
It helps.

123
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,101
Yes.

124
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,161
Okay, great.

125
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,402
And this is actually a great

126
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:19,624
use of the document.

127
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:20,865
These are all things that

128
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:22,788
please let us know as early as possible.

129
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:25,151
If you cannot hear someone or

130
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,152
if you think we are

131
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,214
sharing the wrong screen or anything like that,

132
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,298
the document is also used for

133
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,200
you to tell us if there's

134
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,383
anything we need to know during

135
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:36,704
the next two and a half hours.

136
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:41,190
So for everyone who joined

137
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,739
us now, sorry, go ahead.

138
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:44,620
No, I wanted to say

139
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,784
that actually this document is

140
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:49,088
the zero exercise for us because

141
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,171
we are going to practice a bit of Markdown

142
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:54,317
and that's exactly the, you

143
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:57,362
know, and this document is written in Markdown.

144
00:16:57,362 --> 00:17:01,849
So you can practice some Markdown.

145
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,452
So it will also come during the lesson.

146
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:04,193
That's great.

147
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:04,414
Yes.

148
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:06,397
So the document will

149
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:08,140
be available throughout the lesson

150
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,351
and you can use it to ask

151
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,953
questions, let us know about

152
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:14,277
things during the exercise session,

153
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,280
let us know how it's going or

154
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,742
if you have any specific questions.

155
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:21,828
And once more for everyone who joined now,

156
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,631
you can find the little pen

157
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,155
symbol up here to go into

158
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:28,278
edit mode and then you can share

159
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,762
if you want to what you had for lunch today.

160
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:32,705
I will also add mine here.

161
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:35,068
I also had breakfast for lunch.

162
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:38,333
It was kind of a late breakfast.

163
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:44,201
And then some more sessions here.

164
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:48,529
Oh, we get some explanations of job titles.

165
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:51,273
How about you, [name]?

166
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:52,355
How would you explain your

167
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,258
current job to someone in 1700?

168
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:56,142
Well, I think that people in

169
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,385
the 1700 may know what a

170
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,389
scientist is or a philosopher is.

171
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:04,267
I mean, I'm, I guess, you know,

172
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:07,030
I'm not, I'm not a farmer.

173
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,152
So possibly to a person from

174
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:11,475
there, I could just pose as

175
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:13,297
one of those people that work,

176
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,319
you know, in an office and stay.

177
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,181
I think that's, you know, stay

178
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,824
on the desk and think more or less, I think.

179
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:23,668
How about you?

180
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,752
Maybe I would say I

181
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:32,482
do calculations by using

182
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,225
more advanced tools.

183
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:40,091
If people had some calculators

184
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,995
back then, they may understand.

185
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,196
Calculator was a job title,

186
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:46,138
so they had, yeah.

187
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:48,061
Yeah.

188
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:50,604
I don't know about 1700s if

189
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,386
it was an actual job title actually.

190
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,212
It's a bit early maybe.

191
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:57,612
Yeah.

192
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,173
So we also have

193
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,657
mechanical calculator operator here.

194
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:04,519
Yes.

195
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,463
Conceptual workflow.

196
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:12,070
That's some more points here.

197
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,659
The chemistry or alchemy.

198
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,001
Yes.

199
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,864
So I mentioned about of chemistry.

200
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:26,232
Okay.

201
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:28,964
Alchemy is dangerous.

202
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:31,928
So it's much better to do it on paper.

203
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:37,554
Yes.

204
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,376
And then we also have

205
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:42,019
the last icebreaker question here

206
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,682
leading us to today's topic

207
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,304
about the best documented project.

208
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:49,448
For the last one minute, [name]

209
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:51,951
and [name], what are the ones

210
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,093
that you find best documented

211
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,695
out there that you have encountered?

212
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:59,419
numpy is well documented i

213
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:02,864
would say yeah yeah i guess

214
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:04,887
that uh numpy is and the

215
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,930
python documentation in general it's

216
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,234
uh it's really it's really nice

217
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:10,957
i think i've learned uh so in

218
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:14,382
the the the re package in python the package

219
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:17,106
for uh regular expressions i

220
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:18,749
think i've learned working

221
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,832
with regular expressions there

222
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:22,294
on the documentation for that

223
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:24,295
package and also yeah

224
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:25,797
Yeah, NumPy I've used a lot.

225
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,502
And it's really nice to it's

226
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,926
a really good documentation, I

227
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,428
would say for for anybody who

228
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,169
wants to use NumPy.

229
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:35,253
Yeah.

230
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,174
Right.

231
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:37,497
And today we might learn how

232
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,880
to write such nice documentation.

233
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,949
It is one o'clock finish time.

234
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,212
So let's get started.

235
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,237
Let me just go back to the

236
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,198
normal view.

237
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:53,283
So welcome everyone to this

238
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:55,807
code refinery workshop day six.

239
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,409
Today, we're going to

240
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:00,193
talk about documentation, how

241
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,336
to write documentation for your

242
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:06,923
code, a topic that is sometimes overlooked,

243
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:07,844
and maybe seen as not

244
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,607
so interesting, or also maybe

245
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:10,408
a little bit hard.

246
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,331
So hopefully, today's lesson will

247
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:13,152
help you with that.

248
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:17,751
Let me go to the workshop webpage.

249
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,035
Hopefully all of you know this page.

250
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,618
This is where you registered.

251
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:22,820
This is also where you can

252
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,806
find all the information for today.

253
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:31,817
So if we scroll down here to day six,

254
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:34,422
you can find the link

255
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:36,586
to the lesson material today, if

256
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,688
you want to follow.

257
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,980
And then you also just got an email

258
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,242
that includes the link to

259
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:46,545
this page, the link to a virtual help room.

260
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:48,308
So if during today you have

261
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,090
any kind of technical trouble,

262
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,172
you can join there and ask

263
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:55,696
[name] all your questions that you have.

264
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:58,259
And then we have the link

265
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:59,561
to the notes document.

266
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,023
This is where you can find

267
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:07,047
another way to find all the links for today.

268
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,290
also to our code of conduct

269
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,573
and how we suggest that you

270
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:13,736
can set up your screen.

271
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,119
And here you can find the icebreakers

272
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,460
that we just briefly discussed

273
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,924
in the 10 minutes before we started.

274
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:21,886
And this document is also

275
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:24,109
here for your questions.

276
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,472
It is how we ask you

277
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,314
to interact with the instructors.

278
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,097
And we will also share all

279
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,059
the links to the materials or

280
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,465
any further links via this document.

281
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:36,786
And the way you can use

282
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,128
this document is you find

283
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:40,470
this little pen symbol, which is

284
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,611
either up here to the right

285
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,494
or somewhere up here to the left for you.

286
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:48,097
You click that, you go into edit mode,

287
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,759
and then you can also join

288
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,801
here, filling in the icebreakers,

289
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:54,663
testing a little bit how this works.

290
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:57,026
And then later you can

291
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,547
fill in your questions in the

292
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:00,069
bottom of the document, or let

293
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:03,632
us know if volume is off or

294
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:06,471
anything else that is happening

295
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:07,092
during the stream.

296
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,756
And with that, I will give

297
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:14,385
over to today's instructors, [name] and [name].

298
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:18,773
Yeah, I will be sharing my screen now.

299
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,217
Have a wonderful workshop, everyone.

300
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:24,343
Let's go to [name]'s screen.

301
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:24,904
Okay.

302
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,485
Thank you, [name].

303
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:27,949
Then I'm going to hide in the background.

304
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,650
Good.

305
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:43,346
So, um, just let me have a look at.

306
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:44,488
Okay, so thank you.

307
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:45,469
Thanks.

308
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:47,653
Thanks, [name], and everybody for

309
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,696
for the nice introduction.

310
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:51,599
So today, we're going to talk

311
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,503
about how to document research software.

312
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:59,671
And we have we have a couple of

313
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,434
of topics to talk about.

314
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,057
We'll discuss first about what

315
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:07,102
we want from the documentation, right?

316
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,464
So why we do that?

317
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:10,286
Why is documentation important?

318
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:10,987
Then we're going to talk

319
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:14,132
about some tools and solutions

320
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:16,215
to the problem of documenting

321
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:18,879
your code, and we'll discuss pros and cons.

322
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,724
Then we are going to talk about

323
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:25,048
how to write documentation in

324
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,375
your code, how to write README files

325
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,863
And we'll have some exercise

326
00:24:30,863 --> 00:24:33,451
and some examples on that.

327
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:37,623
And then we are going to be to

328
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:38,724
do something more complex.

329
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,905
So we are going to see

330
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,868
how to generate beautiful

331
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:43,890
documentation like the one for

332
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,314
many Python projects through Sphinx.

333
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:49,276
And we also talk about how

334
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,920
to host that documentation on GitHub.

335
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,583
Okay, so that people can go on the web

336
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,004
and see the documentation of

337
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:59,347
your that you've written, just

338
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:03,211
going on, on the web and GitHub.

339
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:07,272
So first thing,

340
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:12,020
is uh just a moment uh motivation

341
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,062
and wish list so if you go

342
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:17,970
to the first uh episode in the lesson okay

343
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,256
so um what would we like

344
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:23,179
to have in the code and

345
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:25,543
why we would like document

346
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:27,627
to document our research code do

347
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:31,015
you have any opinion [name]

348
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:34,719
Well, for me, if it's a small project

349
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:37,803
for myself, I would do

350
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,926
some documentation in case I

351
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:43,870
forgot stuff after several days or

352
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,712
a week or even months.

353
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:49,356
If it's a project I'm

354
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:51,519
collaborating with people, it would

355
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,163
be more important to have good documentation.

356
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:57,726
it would make it easier

357
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:59,669
for your colleagues or your

358
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:02,693
collaborators to work with you.

359
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:04,976
Yeah.

360
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:08,481
And of course, just let me interrupt you.

361
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:10,484
Our listeners, our audience,

362
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:13,227
well, they can, you can

363
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:16,732
write whatever comes to your

364
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:18,214
mind regarding this in

365
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:19,616
the collaborative notes.

366
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:23,412
So please add comments.

367
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,456
add any consideration there.

368
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,307
The idea for this lesson in general is

369
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:36,317
that we talk a bit about a topic,

370
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:37,439
but you can also write at

371
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,082
the same time some comments in

372
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:40,706
the notes, and then we will

373
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:43,331
typically go to the notes and

374
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:46,008
have a look and see what

375
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:47,370
how people are written comment on

376
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,374
that so we'll try to keep

377
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,856
it interactive in this way

378
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,158
you write something in the note

379
00:26:52,158 --> 00:26:54,963
and we comment on it and we praise you

380
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,185
for your courage in writing

381
00:26:56,185 --> 00:27:02,956
something there okay so yeah the

382
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,979
the first the first like

383
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:07,864
interactive activity we have here is yeah so

384
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,545
describe why you wouldn't

385
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,227
want documentation.

386
00:27:11,227 --> 00:27:14,315
We have already mentioned some reasons why.

387
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:17,403
And also, there's a second question.

388
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,127
Once we've defined why

389
00:27:19,127 --> 00:27:21,253
we want documentation, how would

390
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:24,942
you describe a useful documentation

391
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,922
body let's say okay and

392
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,865
there's also another question uh

393
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,466
how can you motivate your

394
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:33,969
colleagues to contribute to

395
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:35,531
the documentation okay this

396
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:40,237
is actually something which is still useful

397
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:41,959
if if it's a collaborative project

398
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,701
and there's many people involved

399
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,423
how do you make that easy

400
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:47,885
and how do you motivate people to

401
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,808
do uh to do this to

402
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:54,473
write documentation okay so let's maybe wait

403
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:58,422
some seconds here and see

404
00:27:58,422 --> 00:27:59,984
what people come up with in

405
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:02,229
the notes, in the collaborative part.

406
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,198
And then we'll also show

407
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,943
our motivations, adding to what

408
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:12,428
[name] has just said.

409
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:31,021
Yeah, so we can start commenting

410
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,703
a bit on what we see, right?

411
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:35,467
On what we see in the pad, in the notes.

412
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:37,590
Well, yeah, so I and

413
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,132
others can understand at any

414
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:41,035
future time what we're doing

415
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,917
and why we're doing this in this way.

416
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:46,823
So this is in the why section.

417
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:47,103
Okay.

418
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:52,310
And yeah, so like

419
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,972
future-proofing your understanding.

420
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:55,254
Future-proofing your understanding is

421
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:57,016
a very important thing.

422
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:58,055
It was...

423
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:00,099
and get a paper published.

424
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:02,503
I guess that's a good reason,

425
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:05,469
a big reason at some time.

426
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:07,332
So basically, right starting

427
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:09,216
writing something in the in

428
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,719
the documentation in some form so

429
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,001
that you can then put that

430
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,085
into the paper paper.

431
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:14,726
Yeah, okay.

432
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:14,967
Okay.

433
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:18,433
Yeah.

434
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:18,614
Yeah.

435
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:18,814
Um,

436
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,242
projects are living things.

437
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:25,006
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:26,268
So people come and go.

439
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:28,252
And it's, it's, it's a way

440
00:29:28,252 --> 00:29:30,597
to future proof the code also,

441
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,481
when not only for your

442
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:35,326
understanding, but also for, for

443
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,711
other people for the poor.

444
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:41,797
whomever may join in the future, yeah.

445
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:44,681
Yeah, otherwise you may need, sorry.

446
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:45,802
Yeah, no, go ahead, go ahead.

447
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:47,124
Yeah, I mean, if you don't

448
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:48,707
have a good documentation, you

449
00:29:48,707 --> 00:29:50,209
may need to explain things

450
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:52,051
to different people multiple times.

451
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,196
Yeah, that's an important thing.

452
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:57,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,480
And so how would you

454
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,283
describe useful documentation?

455
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:03,508
Yeah, so easy, okay, easier understanding.

456
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,597
Can you share the notes or

457
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,919
I can share the notes.

458
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,501
What you want me to share the notes?

459
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:11,803
No, I can share the notes here.

460
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:15,408
Yeah, it's a good thing to do now.

461
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:19,554
Just, yeah.

462
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,138
Wait, these are actually, I

463
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:24,401
need to scroll down a little more.

464
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,302
Yes, okay.

465
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:32,240
I see that useful documentation

466
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,182
needs to be easy to understand.

467
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:38,126
There are need to make

468
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,128
few assumption on what people know.

469
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,451
I have something to say

470
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:44,211
about that, I think.

471
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:47,374
Then also appropriate to the

472
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:49,276
scale of the project be documented.

473
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:50,077
That's cool.

474
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:52,118
If you don't want to write too much

475
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,099
for a small project, you

476
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:54,020
don't want to write too little

477
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,855
for a big project, I guess.

478
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,316
And how can you motivate

479
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,277
your colleagues to contribute

480
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:00,679
to the documentation?

481
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,343
It's actually, yeah, there's about

482
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:06,964
a cake on Friday.

483
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:07,985
Maybe, you know, more in

484
00:31:07,985 --> 00:31:11,749
general, some social repercussions

485
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:15,112
for those who don't contribute.

486
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:15,352
Yes.

487
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:19,736
So maybe we can have a look

488
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:25,161
at our, what we would recommend at the moment.

489
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:26,150
So,

490
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,733
Our motivations, well, you

491
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,755
will probably use the code in

492
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,138
the future and may forget details.

493
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,203
You may want others to use your code,

494
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,165
and you may want others

495
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:35,367
to contribute to the code.

496
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:38,894
This is also an important thing.

497
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:41,479
So contributions to many

498
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,162
open source projects actually

499
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:46,720
happen first through documentation.

500
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,662
people will use your code,

501
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:51,805
find, read the documentation, find

502
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:52,846
that something maybe it's

503
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:54,468
not well documented, or

504
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:55,910
because that's actually very difficult

505
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,571
to keep the documentation up to date.

506
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:00,575
And that's the usually first problem

507
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:02,777
that people find with the code, it's okay,

508
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:03,558
there's a problem in the

509
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:04,919
documentation, it doesn't say this,

510
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,841
or it's not, it's not up to date.

511
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,202
So they may actually open

512
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:10,245
the pull request on your documentation,

513
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,826
that on your documentation,

514
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:14,429
that's the first time the first way that they

515
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:17,860
interact and, you know, contribute

516
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,341
to the code.

517
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:19,966
Okay.

518
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:20,769
And that's the thing that

519
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,159
can you mentioned that?

520
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,377
So

521
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,721
it's very useful to have

522
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,983
a list of questions or a list of problems

523
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,986
that have been already solved, let's say,

524
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,469
and their solution in the documentation

525
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:41,273
so that you can save your time

526
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:41,994
and also the time of

527
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,757
your colleagues from asking, from,

528
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:48,421
you know, helping people in trivial ways.

529
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:50,103
It's very nice to help people, but

530
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:52,066
Maybe if we can do

531
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:55,130
away with some repetitive work,

532
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,595
sometimes it's nice.

533
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:58,715
Okay.

534
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,017
So what do we expect from

535
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:02,080
a suitably good documentation?

536
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,701
Okay.

537
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:08,189
So it very depends on the

538
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,791
goal of the competition, right?

539
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:13,997
So maybe you do you want

540
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:14,658
to comment on that?

541
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,225
Yeah, I would say, well, documentation.

542
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:22,008
are in different forms.

543
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,373
But we have actually have

544
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:27,035
a good picture here showing

545
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:29,679
different types of documentation.

546
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,706
Yeah, this is from the company Divio.

547
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:35,548
And the author of this,

548
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,314
this is a documentation itself.

549
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:43,781
They divide the documentation

550
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,448
into four parts here.

551
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:48,230
the four quadrants here you can

552
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,274
see in the picture, the tutorials,

553
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:54,919
how to get reference and the explanation.

554
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,387
So reference means, usually it

555
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,170
means the automatically generated

556
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,412
API reference.

557
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:10,260
It has information about the interface

558
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,743
and the doc strings of a

559
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,747
function, a method or module.

560
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:22,835
And then how to get its problem oriented.

561
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:24,538
If you have a certain problem

562
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:26,180
you want to solve, you can

563
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,243
check out this kind of documentation.

564
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:32,989
It usually involves steps showing

565
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,831
how to solve the problem,

566
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,698
step one, step two, and so on.

567
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:39,681
Basically, very practically.

568
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:40,823
Yeah, very practically.

569
00:34:40,823 --> 00:34:43,026
You don't need to know exactly

570
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:46,071
what each step is doing,

571
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:47,853
but by following this

572
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,956
documentation, you probably will

573
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:50,737
solve your problem.

574
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,044
And then tutorials are also very common.

575
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:57,256
It's learning oriented.

576
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,717
basically telling you what's

577
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:01,861
the best practice, what's the process

578
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:04,744
and what kind of techniques here

579
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:08,768
you use to solve certain problems.

580
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,832
The last one is explanation.

581
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:14,734
It's understanding oriented.

582
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:21,961
My understanding is it involves

583
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:24,705
the design logic of a certain

584
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,308
uh project uh maybe also the

585
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:31,433
history of a project uh yeah so

586
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,496
it's a it's a it's a more

587
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:36,740
general he has a more um yeah scope

588
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,004
which is wider let's say and

589
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,626
i think in in the research

590
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:44,270
software uh this has uh very much

591
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,892
to do with the the research

592
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:47,714
domain as you mentioned right so

593
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:50,345
um yeah so yeah may also

594
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:53,772
involves domain knowledge, especially

595
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:55,717
if it's a multi-discipline

596
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,144
project, then yeah, it gives

597
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:02,852
you some explanation of the domain knowledge.

598
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,262
I think the idea of

599
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:08,445
having these four quadrants is also

600
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,809
because different people or even

601
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,150
the same people in different

602
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,014
parts at different times may

603
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,076
need something different.

604
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:20,301
More experienced developers,

605
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:21,082
more experienced people may

606
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,424
actually need just the reference.

607
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:25,348
uh some beginners may need a

608
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:27,190
how to guide just because i

609
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,974
want to do something simple but uh people

610
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,097
that have nothing no domain experience

611
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:33,358
or no domain knowledge they

612
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,121
may need some explanations some

613
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,123
more tutorials and so on right

614
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:38,285
i guess it's uh the point

615
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:40,528
is different people need different things

616
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:41,950
and these are like kind

617
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,713
of taxonomy of documentation types

618
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,378
okay and uh so as we

619
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,401
mentioned here there's there's no

620
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:52,799
one size fits all okay

621
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:57,225
often right a readme may be enough okay

622
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:58,486
but uh so and that's

623
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,050
something we recommend to start with

624
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,413
but uh but uh yeah

625
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:05,355
different people be different kinds

626
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,057
of user may need different things

627
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:09,541
and and you need to be aware of this

628
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,682
when you write documentation if

629
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:12,104
you want that to be useful

630
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,287
to each one of these different

631
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:21,335
uses um okay uh so i would say

632
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:24,039
because we have a lot of stuff to cover.

633
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,602
We would have another

634
00:37:26,602 --> 00:37:28,184
collaborative exercise here about

635
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:29,186
a wish list.

636
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:32,270
But I think we could skip

637
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,174
the exercise and comment on what

638
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:36,315
we would like to have.

639
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:37,577
Do you agree?

640
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:39,600
Yes, I agree.

641
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,321
Okay.

642
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:42,444
So what would you like to

643
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:45,408
have in the documentation?

644
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:47,290
And how would you like to develop it?

645
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,053
And what are the practices

646
00:37:49,053 --> 00:37:50,950
you would like to adopt?

647
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,555
I will just here unfold

648
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:57,720
this because we have quite some

649
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,843
things to touch upon.

650
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:01,846
Versioning, versions, right?

651
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,892
Versions are important.

652
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,015
So if you have a

653
00:38:08,015 --> 00:38:11,421
long-running software project that

654
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:15,366
evolves over time, its features may change.

655
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:16,989
And so the documentation

656
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:19,705
itself should change with the code.

657
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:21,648
A version of the documentation

658
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:23,230
should match the version of the code.

659
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,154
This is especially true for reference,

660
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:30,721
for things like explanations

661
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,627
or more domain-specific things.

662
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:38,212
This is not necessary, but actually

663
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:40,415
for things that relate to

664
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:45,022
the code more precisely, you

665
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,765
need to have version control.

666
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:49,574
You need to version control your

667
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:53,623
documentation with the code okay

668
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,610
yeah uh yeah and then there's

669
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,394
this uh about and uh one

670
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,900
thing um whenever you want

671
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,544
interrupting right it's just that

672
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:05,842
i'm going to go through this uh just

673
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:07,924
So documentation should be

674
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:09,927
placed and tracked close to the source code.

675
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,550
But why we want that?

676
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,414
Because if you keep it

677
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:18,036
this way, it's easier for

678
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:20,238
the developers to contribute

679
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:21,700
to documentation and to make

680
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,922
sure that these things are kept in sync.

681
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:30,149
So another thing is, please

682
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,285
use a standard markup language.

683
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:35,590
By markup language, we

684
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,054
mentioned, for example, the Markdown.

685
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:42,060
It's called Markdown if it's, we

686
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,144
call it a markup language here.

687
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:46,227
Markdown is not typically exactly

688
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:48,530
a markup language, I think technically,

689
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,674
but still it's something that

690
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:53,733
you can write using the same editor.

691
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,176
and the same editor that you

692
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,258
use to write code.

693
00:39:57,258 --> 00:40:00,963
And also, you can use the same tools

694
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:03,106
that you use to version your

695
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:05,850
code, Git, for example.

696
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,412
You can do Git diffs

697
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:09,075
of your documentation as well as the code.

698
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:13,300
And here we mentioned two

699
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,647
different file formats, which are

700
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,771
plain text files.

701
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:22,059
the plain text file formats,

702
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:24,025
which is restructured text and markdown.

703
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:24,828
We'll comment on the

704
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:27,457
difference between these two in later.

705
00:40:29,102 --> 00:40:30,607
One thing we want to,

706
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,734
I think it's important is

707
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:38,372
These are plain text file types.

708
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:40,715
And one thing which is not

709
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:41,897
a plain text file type is,

710
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:46,905
for example, Word documents or even PDF files.

711
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:50,270
So you can still generate

712
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,495
PDF files from documentation, but

713
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,318
these things should not be the

714
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:58,703
main source of the documentation.

715
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,267
We'll talk about this also later.

716
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,172
Other things?

717
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:08,580
We see PDFs actually, it may

718
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,208
be good for some user manuals.

719
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,831
I think people in some domains

720
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:15,993
use PDF a lot.

721
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:22,158
But yeah, it has some disadvantages here.

722
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:23,361
Yeah, for example, it's

723
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:26,367
difficult to copy-paste out of a PDF document.

724
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,071
So if you have a code

725
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,635
snippet in a PDF document,

726
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:34,025
it's typically hard to copy-paste.

727
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,067
There's actually another thing

728
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,232
written by humans.

729
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:42,070
Maybe now it's a bit...

730
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,252
I mean, would you use

731
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:46,377
AI to write documentation?

732
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,039
Well, to be honest, I would use.

733
00:41:49,522 --> 00:41:54,429
AI could actually do many

734
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,152
kinds of documentations.

735
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:58,355
The four formats we mentioned

736
00:41:58,355 --> 00:42:01,460
before, AI can do all of them.

737
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,864
But I think we need to clarify a bit here.

738
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:07,988
Automatically generated documentation,

739
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:10,932
we mean the API documentation

740
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:14,356
extracted from the doc strings

741
00:42:14,356 --> 00:42:16,759
or function interfaces.

742
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:18,822
It's not the AI generated.

743
00:42:18,822 --> 00:42:20,704
But of course, AI

744
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,827
generated documentation is also

745
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:26,620
automatically generated.

746
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,845
But I think it needs still

747
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:31,428
to be reviewed by a human.

748
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:34,172
But yeah, I think here we are saying,

749
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,576
yeah, the reference documentation

750
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:38,399
that the tools you use

751
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:40,803
generate, like, and we'll see

752
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:43,708
later, well, these are not enough.

753
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,131
You also need some kind of prose.

754
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:46,292
You need also some kind

755
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:50,313
of something written by humans.

756
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:53,938
in plain English, or plain,

757
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,362
you know, natural language.

758
00:42:56,362 --> 00:42:56,702
That's it.

759
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:00,087
I think that also, there

760
00:43:00,087 --> 00:43:01,970
are some other things that needs

761
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,056
to be added to, to your to the documentation.

762
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:08,015
So installation instructions,

763
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:10,258
It can be just a pip

764
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:12,420
install, just a simple command sometimes.

765
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,983
But depending on the domain

766
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:18,187
you come from and the tooling you're using,

767
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:19,689
maybe the installation instructions

768
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:20,870
are much more complicated.

769
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,492
And then, please, that should

770
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:26,036
be written, documented precisely.

771
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:30,221
And that's one thing.

772
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:32,203
So step-by-step instructions are

773
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:35,875
actually very welcome.

774
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,860
There's another thing about licenses.

775
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:44,270
Licenses should be in the

776
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,552
repository of the code.

777
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:46,254
That's true.

778
00:43:46,254 --> 00:43:47,436
But it's nice if in

779
00:43:47,436 --> 00:43:49,319
the documentation you specify which

780
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,022
kind of license you are

781
00:43:51,022 --> 00:43:55,811
licensing your code with.

782
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:59,905
And also, if you want people to contribute,

783
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,447
to your code, or to

784
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:02,629
your project in general, you

785
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:04,993
should give them some guidelines

786
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:06,635
how to contribute to my code.

787
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,078
So should I open the pull request?

788
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:08,959
Should I open an issue?

789
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:10,421
And then we discuss it.

790
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:11,804
So there are different ways

791
00:44:12,805 --> 00:44:16,431
people work on code and on the project.

792
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:18,053
And it's better to point

793
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:20,838
these things out in explicitly

794
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,822
in the documentation in some way.

795
00:44:22,822 --> 00:44:24,987
At different stages, you may

796
00:44:24,987 --> 00:44:27,652
want people to contribute in different ways.

797
00:44:27,652 --> 00:44:31,340
That also means documentation

798
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,008
is something you need to iterate.

799
00:44:36,558 --> 00:44:39,542
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:41,164
Also, there's different ways

801
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:43,047
why documentation can change over

802
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,489
time and you should version control it.

803
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:45,991
It's not just the code changes,

804
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:47,513
but also that the documentation

805
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:49,977
itself can be improved and that

806
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:52,260
need should be under version control.

807
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,929
So here in the notes, there's a checklist.

808
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,211
So in principle, well, you

809
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:01,873
could use this checklist to

810
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,344
to compare this with some projects

811
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:07,886
that you have or that you're using

812
00:45:07,886 --> 00:45:13,011
and see if actually

813
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:19,398
those documentations have all these

814
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:21,100
entries in them.

815
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:27,031
Okay, so let's move on to the next part.

816
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:29,555
okay uh popular tools and solutions

817
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:32,180
so what are the um the

818
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,243
tools that people can use for this

819
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:37,328
and what are the trade-offs there

820
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,233
and the objective here is that you know

821
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:42,477
if we do a brief review

822
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:45,642
of of what is available and um

823
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,085
and and then you can choose

824
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,340
what is the best thing to you

825
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,482
So in-code documentation, this is

826
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,724
a big thing.

827
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:53,365
It's code.

828
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:55,727
Code has, you can write comments there.

829
00:45:55,727 --> 00:46:00,533
There's a lot to be said about this.

830
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:03,556
But we are going to talk about this later.

831
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:05,959
So I'm not going to spend much time here.

832
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,883
So readme.

833
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:11,044
Readme files.

834
00:46:11,044 --> 00:46:12,586
The advantage of using

835
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:14,688
readme files compared to other

836
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,991
things is that, well, they are versioned.

837
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:19,225
They stay in the same file.

838
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:20,426
repository as the code.

839
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:24,850
It's often enough to have

840
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,773
a readme.md markdown or readme

841
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:28,713
in restructured text.

842
00:46:29,814 --> 00:46:32,897
RST stands for restructured text.

843
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:38,943
And yeah, so it's a very

844
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:41,505
typical thing to have a readme in your code.

845
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:47,575
So talking about these two different

846
00:46:47,575 --> 00:46:49,419
formats.

847
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:52,344
Here in the notes, you see

848
00:46:52,344 --> 00:46:54,508
that there are these two, there's

849
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:56,993
like a side by side comparison

850
00:46:56,993 --> 00:47:02,103
of a very simple example of Markdown.

851
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:04,868
So you may be actually

852
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:06,091
familiar with Markdown, because as

853
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:06,732
I said before,

854
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:11,236
This is the same format that

855
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,799
we use in our collaborative notes.

856
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,702
You see that they have

857
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:18,203
sections and subsections.

858
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,244
They start with a hash or

859
00:47:19,244 --> 00:47:21,246
the double hash and the triple hash

860
00:47:21,246 --> 00:47:22,688
or a quadruple hash, depending

861
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:25,311
on the nestedness you have for the section.

862
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:29,775
Then paragraphs are simple.

863
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:33,728
You can have code blocks or indented

864
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:36,912
bits that can be quotations or code blocks.

865
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:43,381
You have standard ways for bold or italics.

866
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,887
You can make lists, and there

867
00:47:47,887 --> 00:47:49,990
can be also number lists, and

868
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,076
there are ways to put in images, links, tables.

869
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:55,919
We'll see a bit about this.

870
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,202
In the restructured text, you

871
00:47:57,202 --> 00:47:59,528
have very similar mechanism.

872
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:02,295
At least in this little

873
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:04,199
example, they look very similar,

874
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:09,051
except that you have some additional

875
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:12,590
like punctuation that you need to add

876
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,034
so restructure a full example

877
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:17,095
of a structured text of a

878
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,798
structured text file can look

879
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:23,122
quite full of little punctuation

880
00:48:23,122 --> 00:48:25,885
that is very significant for the formatting

881
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:29,709
so the idea is that

882
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:31,271
restructure text has more

883
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,774
features than markdown but markdown

884
00:48:33,774 --> 00:48:37,679
is simpler okay there are

885
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:39,406
many flavors of markdown

886
00:48:39,406 --> 00:48:40,951
Unfortunately, things are

887
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,538
possibly improving in the last decade

888
00:48:43,538 --> 00:48:44,762
or so in the sense that

889
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:50,258
people have come up with some kind of standards.

890
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:53,918
And so now things that you write and appear

891
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:55,801
and look good on GitHub, they

892
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:59,167
may also look quite as expected

893
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:02,092
on GitLab, for example.

894
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:06,319
Or Bitbucket, if you have a readme

895
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,321
and you want it to

896
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:10,105
appear consistently in different platforms.

897
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:14,713
Nowadays, more or less, to

898
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,195
an extent, it's almost guaranteed.

899
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:20,075
But at the beginning, it was not so.

900
00:49:20,075 --> 00:49:23,720
Yeah, so in our case, for this,

901
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,162
when we are going to talk about Sphinx

902
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:28,067
and the documentation generation,

903
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,829
we are going to use a

904
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,291
flavor of Markdown, which is

905
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,154
called MyST, which I don't

906
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:34,155
remember what it stands for.

907
00:49:36,419 --> 00:49:40,004
But it's a kind of hybrid between Markdown,

908
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:42,067
which is very simple, as

909
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:46,974
Markdown is, but it has some

910
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:48,376
features of a structured text.

911
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:50,399
That's why MyST is.

912
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:53,344
looks reminds a bit of restructure text.

913
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:59,654
So so these are the we mentioned, readmes,

914
00:49:59,654 --> 00:50:00,896
how to write them, what are

915
00:50:00,896 --> 00:50:05,684
the what are the formats you may have, okay.

916
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:09,370
And another piece of the puzzle, another

917
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:12,309
piece of technology that we

918
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,711
need to talk about are

919
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,854
HTML static site generators.

920
00:50:15,854 --> 00:50:18,037
So these are tools that

921
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:19,899
take your markdown or structure

922
00:50:19,899 --> 00:50:23,624
text files, and then they output HTML files.

923
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:26,988
So basically documentation that

924
00:50:26,988 --> 00:50:28,130
you can host on the web.

925
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,891
Okay.

926
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:29,832
There's many of them.

927
00:50:29,832 --> 00:50:31,194
There's Sphinx, which is the

928
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,036
one that we are going to talk about.

929
00:50:33,036 --> 00:50:36,316
There's Jekyll, which is the one that it

930
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:38,458
GitHub uses by default.

931
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,080
There's pkgdown, which is

932
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,941
something which is very popular

933
00:50:41,941 --> 00:50:43,162
in the R community.

934
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:43,623
I think that if

935
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,426
you're writing documentation for an R project,

936
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:48,788
you typically use pkgdown or

937
00:50:48,788 --> 00:50:51,450
things related to that community.

938
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,412
There's mkdocs, which is something

939
00:50:53,412 --> 00:50:54,653
which is getting more and

940
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:55,934
more popular nowadays, I think.

941
00:50:57,216 --> 00:50:58,617
And there's many, many of those.

942
00:50:59,438 --> 00:51:01,780
And yeah, so if you want

943
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,729
your HTML static site to be visible,

944
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,331
to the web, then you can

945
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,054
host it in different places.

946
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:11,598
GitHub pages, we'll see GitHub pages.

947
00:51:11,598 --> 00:51:13,681
Bitbucket pages is really

948
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,744
similar, and GitLab pages as well.

949
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:19,449
It's yet another flavor, the same thing,

950
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:20,531
a service that allows you

951
00:51:20,531 --> 00:51:23,355
to host HTML documentation on the web.

952
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:25,979
Yeah.

953
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:28,723
Other things, there are some

954
00:51:28,723 --> 00:51:29,985
things we are not going to

955
00:51:29,985 --> 00:51:32,489
talk about much is our wikis.

956
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,598
Wikis are easy to...

957
00:51:35,598 --> 00:51:37,743
to interact with, typically,

958
00:51:37,743 --> 00:51:39,187
especially for non-developers.

959
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:41,392
But the problem is that

960
00:51:41,392 --> 00:51:43,497
they are not version controlled with the code.

961
00:51:43,497 --> 00:51:44,680
So that's something which is

962
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,742
a bit suboptimal for us.

963
00:51:46,965 --> 00:51:51,781
Other formats, LaTeX and PDF, we can...

964
00:51:51,781 --> 00:51:54,684
So Sphinx can generate PDFs for you,

965
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:57,167
and many of these

966
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:59,610
documentation generators can actually

967
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:04,015
create a PDF output or even

968
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:06,338
just a LaTeX output out of your Markdown file.

969
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:08,120
So there's a way to convert this.

970
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,522
But as we said, PDF

971
00:52:11,844 --> 00:52:13,346
has some little problems for us,

972
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:17,836
so we're not going to talk about this further.

973
00:52:17,836 --> 00:52:20,339
Yeah, Doxygen is yet

974
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:23,402
another documentation generator that

975
00:52:23,402 --> 00:52:26,405
takes some kind of information

976
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:29,409
and generates HTML files out of this.

977
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:32,152
The cool thing about Doxygen,

978
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,715
for those who have never heard about this,

979
00:52:34,715 --> 00:52:36,577
is that it auto-generates

980
00:52:36,577 --> 00:52:39,700
API documentation, typically for C

981
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,650
and C++ code, but also for other languages.

982
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,212
And Sphinx can also do that.

983
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:49,915
So the idea is that many of these tools,

984
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,057
they not only generate HTML

985
00:52:52,057 --> 00:52:55,180
code, HTML documentation, starting

986
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,180
from Markdown, but they can

987
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,484
also scrape your code and look for comments,

988
00:53:00,484 --> 00:53:04,268
some special comments, and create

989
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,789
an API reference for this,

990
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,551
exactly like Doxygen does.

991
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,512
Okay.

992
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:09,092
And yeah.

993
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,174
Okay.

994
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:13,861
So I would say let's move on.

995
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,767
and go to the next one,

996
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:17,793
which is about in-code documentation.

997
00:53:19,638 --> 00:53:23,210
Yeah, that's probably the first place

998
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,413
you write some documentation

999
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:29,776
because it's just an access to your code.

1000
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:34,680
We can see the regular comments

1001
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:38,883
is the most commonly used one.

1002
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:43,067
We can see different types comments

1003
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:44,989
as shown here, comment A

1004
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:48,772
and comment B. Which one do

1005
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:52,235
you think is more useful?

1006
00:53:52,235 --> 00:53:54,438
Well, I think it depends on

1007
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:55,479
the on the person, right?

1008
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,784
So if, if someone does not know

1009
00:53:58,784 --> 00:54:00,246
how to code at all, okay,

1010
00:54:00,246 --> 00:54:02,148
then the first comment would be okay,

1011
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:04,191
so it's explaining me is

1012
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:05,673
it explains me what what the

1013
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:06,694
code is doing, right?

1014
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,318
But if instead, I know what the code does,

1015
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:10,700
okay, more or less, because

1016
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,983
I can read Python, okay, then

1017
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,665
I think the second one, which

1018
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:17,249
tells me the second one

1019
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:18,526
tells me more information.

1020
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:21,129
It gives me some background, I would say.

1021
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:22,471
And we should always try

1022
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,453
to write comments for those

1023
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:27,196
who can already code, I think.

1024
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:29,379
So I think I like comment to be more.

1025
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,862
Yeah.

1026
00:54:31,862 --> 00:54:33,804
Yeah, we should assume that

1027
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,908
the users know about a certain language.

1028
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,973
Yeah, that's a regular

1029
00:54:40,973 --> 00:54:44,800
documentation, a regular comment.

1030
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,186
We can write to the commenter

1031
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:51,970
in the more standard ways,

1032
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:55,795
which is called docstrings.

1033
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,238
Let me scroll down.

1034
00:54:58,238 --> 00:54:58,458
Yes.

1035
00:55:00,161 --> 00:55:06,229
Docstrings gives more information

1036
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:07,490
about your code.

1037
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:13,488
As we can see some examples,

1038
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:16,733
with regular comments in Python

1039
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,037
or the other languages.

1040
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:24,346
They come with different format,

1041
00:55:24,346 --> 00:55:28,312
but the purpose is the same.

1042
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:32,840
For docstrings, for example,

1043
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,683
for Python, the docstrings

1044
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:36,886
will look like this.

1045
00:55:36,886 --> 00:55:38,889
You give some information about

1046
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:43,075
the purpose of this function or method.

1047
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:44,757
And what's the input?

1048
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:46,279
What is the output?

1049
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,845
Should we show another line?

1050
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,790
So actually, this is restructured text.

1051
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,332
Doesn't look like, but it's

1052
00:55:55,332 --> 00:55:57,355
actually a string of text

1053
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,577
written in restructured text that

1054
00:55:58,577 --> 00:56:01,541
then Sphinx can extract.

1055
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:04,737
Can look at, for example, R, I guess.

1056
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:08,081
Okay, yeah, that's the standard

1057
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:11,445
format for R comments.

1058
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:15,209
Or oxygen too, so this

1059
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:18,293
is a particular, yeah.

1060
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:23,158
Or oxygen is like the oxygen for R though.

1061
00:56:23,158 --> 00:56:25,621
Yeah, it also has the input

1062
00:56:25,621 --> 00:56:29,746
output and the other explanations of the code.

1063
00:56:29,746 --> 00:56:33,352
yeah so uh with this kind

1064
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,577
of format uh some tools like

1065
00:56:36,577 --> 00:56:40,324
spins can extract the information

1066
00:56:40,324 --> 00:56:42,087
from here to generate a

1067
00:56:42,087 --> 00:56:45,172
well api reference documentation for

1068
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:47,876
us and we will see this

1069
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:52,804
later in the hands-on yeah yes

1070
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:53,205
uh should we move on

1071
00:56:55,598 --> 00:56:58,042
Yeah, so yeah, I think

1072
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:00,946
we have mentioned everything here, right?

1073
00:57:00,946 --> 00:57:01,848
I guess there was a

1074
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:04,251
mention about comments in the code.

1075
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:05,193
The people that do with

1076
00:57:05,193 --> 00:57:06,615
commenting, I also do it quite

1077
00:57:06,615 --> 00:57:08,538
a lot that I misuse comment

1078
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,721
to just silence code.

1079
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:13,906
Yeah, that's something we know

1080
00:57:13,906 --> 00:57:14,888
that we shouldn't do that.

1081
00:57:14,888 --> 00:57:16,630
I think that, yeah, it's

1082
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,293
better to avoid this.

1083
00:57:18,293 --> 00:57:19,775
Yeah, I also do a bit,

1084
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:21,838
but it's not recommended.

1085
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,758
We should use GitHub version control.

1086
00:57:24,758 --> 00:57:25,920
instead of this.

1087
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:29,505
Yeah, instead of like keeping

1088
00:57:29,505 --> 00:57:30,968
zombie code just in case.

1089
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:32,009
Or if you want, you can maybe

1090
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:34,533
put it into a module, a

1091
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:36,536
separate module that, you know, yeah.

1092
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,918
So there's different things you

1093
00:57:37,918 --> 00:57:39,100
can do to avoid this.

1094
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,305
Just take it, try not to do this.

1095
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:43,707
I think we know, everybody knows

1096
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:44,669
that it's better to avoid

1097
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,613
misusing comments for what comments

1098
00:57:47,613 --> 00:57:48,675
are not meant for.

1099
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:48,895
Yes.

1100
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:53,382
Okay, so...

1101
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:55,496
Let's go on.

1102
00:57:55,496 --> 00:57:56,919
Yes.

1103
00:57:56,919 --> 00:58:00,026
So this is about writing good README files.

1104
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:02,071
So there's going to be

1105
00:58:02,071 --> 00:58:04,136
a bit of hands-on-ish part.

1106
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:05,920
We'll have a couple of exercises here.

1107
00:58:07,744 --> 00:58:09,548
So

1108
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:14,141
So the important thing to

1109
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:16,483
say about READMEs is that READMEs

1110
00:58:16,483 --> 00:58:18,305
are the first thing that a

1111
00:58:18,305 --> 00:58:21,509
user sees when they visit your

1112
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:25,473
code page on GitHub or GitLab or wherever.

1113
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:27,315
And also, since it's an

1114
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:29,998
imperative, it's written in all capitals,

1115
00:58:29,998 --> 00:58:31,940
even if I get just code

1116
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,962
from someone on my computer and

1117
00:58:33,962 --> 00:58:35,323
I look at the directory and I

1118
00:58:35,323 --> 00:58:37,325
see that there's a README file,

1119
00:58:37,325 --> 00:58:40,969
then I typically go to that thing first.

1120
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:49,163
It's quite important for this reason.

1121
00:58:49,163 --> 00:58:54,070
I would like to show this thing right away.

1122
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,993
Have fun testing some README features.

1123
00:58:55,993 --> 00:58:59,017
I will do this interactively.

1124
00:58:59,017 --> 00:59:03,724
I will just copy this into

1125
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:08,211
this URL in another browser window.

1126
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,999
Then I will go to GitHub and

1127
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:17,506
Let's see if I, just to show you how, yeah.

1128
00:59:17,506 --> 00:59:20,470
So I have my own, I

1129
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,733
mean, my own GitHub account.

1130
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:26,437
And I created just a

1131
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,500
new repository with the readme so

1132
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,422
that I can test these things quickly.

1133
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:32,525
So I will create something

1134
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:35,128
like, this repository needs to

1135
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:36,190
be my repository.

1136
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:39,694
Then I will say, readme.

1137
00:59:40,602 --> 00:59:44,949
readme-example, example, okay, I'll

1138
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,371
call it readme-example2.

1139
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:49,295
I thought I actually read

1140
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,538
the other there, but it's okay.

1141
00:59:51,538 --> 00:59:55,124
Yeah, so I will add a readme

1142
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,127
so that I can go, it's

1143
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,210
public also, so it's fine.

1144
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:04,278
Readme, yeah, readme repository, okay.

1145
01:00:04,278 --> 01:00:05,920
And now I want to open

1146
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,851
here this readme and modify it.

1147
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:11,216
and try some cool stuff.

1148
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,080
Okay.

1149
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,504
Yeah, so Michael is going to

1150
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:18,953
show us some markdown, some readme

1151
01:00:18,953 --> 01:00:21,700
files in the Git repo.

1152
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,524
Of course, you can do it

1153
01:00:23,524 --> 01:00:25,849
in a local editor, like VS

1154
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:27,332
Code or something else.

1155
01:00:28,156 --> 01:00:29,139
Yeah, the cool thing about

1156
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:31,404
doing this here on GitHub is that

1157
01:00:31,404 --> 01:00:33,831
then I have a preview, which

1158
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,615
may not be that easy on

1159
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:37,681
your own computer, let's say.

1160
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:43,816
So first thing is that we can have like...

1161
01:00:43,816 --> 01:00:46,478
different highlights the different

1162
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:48,280
uh text highlighted in different

1163
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,802
ways okay uh so if you want

1164
01:00:50,802 --> 01:00:53,245
to uh stress some information in

1165
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:54,486
addition to you know what we

1166
01:00:54,486 --> 01:00:56,988
have already seen with the bold italics

1167
01:00:56,988 --> 01:00:58,489
and sections so these are

1168
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:03,514
some interesting features here i

1169
01:01:03,514 --> 01:01:05,296
can see the preview here so

1170
01:01:06,116 --> 01:01:07,598
yeah uh warning important notes

1171
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:09,920
there's other things uh if you

1172
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,651
look at the notes actually uh here

1173
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:16,578
You can see that there's more kind of,

1174
01:01:16,578 --> 01:01:17,640
if you want to really be

1175
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,887
colorful in your readme, you can do that.

1176
01:01:24,596 --> 01:01:25,778
There are other things.

1177
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:29,827
One thing which I want to

1178
01:01:29,827 --> 01:01:33,195
show you now is this.

1179
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,119
Wait a moment.

1180
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,241
I will need to slightly

1181
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:41,564
correct this because there was... Okay,

1182
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:45,188
so here, what I've done is

1183
01:01:45,188 --> 01:01:46,589
that I have pasted some

1184
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:50,713
text, which actually, if you

1185
01:01:50,713 --> 01:01:52,475
know anything about HTML, well,

1186
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,677
this looks like HTML code.

1187
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,320
And it is indeed HTML code.

1188
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,623
And what it does is this.

1189
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:02,707
So I have...

1190
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:05,611
basically, a short summary visible, okay.

1191
01:02:05,611 --> 01:02:07,353
And then if I click on

1192
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:09,876
this, also, I have some

1193
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,639
text which becomes readable only

1194
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:13,281
when I click, okay.

1195
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:16,965
And so this is a way that you can,

1196
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:21,011
like, hide details that maybe

1197
01:02:21,011 --> 01:02:23,734
can be omitted in the first

1198
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:25,477
reading of your readme, for example.

1199
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:27,279
It's a way to structure

1200
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:30,203
readme in yet another way.

1201
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:30,770
And

1202
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,452
this is an example of the fact

1203
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:35,396
that you can use html code

1204
01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:37,959
in principle in markdown files

1205
01:02:37,959 --> 01:02:40,863
that's actually something that

1206
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:43,446
markdown recommends markdown is a

1207
01:02:43,446 --> 01:02:47,631
simple it's a simple format so

1208
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:48,472
if you want to do something

1209
01:02:48,472 --> 01:02:50,234
more fancy well the recommendation

1210
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:52,297
used to be just write in

1211
01:02:52,297 --> 01:02:55,240
like html and it's that's the

1212
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,762
reason why it's possible nowadays

1213
01:02:56,762 --> 01:02:58,698
i would say maybe you know

1214
01:02:58,698 --> 01:03:00,581
the more recent flavors of

1215
01:03:00,581 --> 01:03:03,985
markdown have also some features

1216
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:05,788
that allow you that that so

1217
01:03:05,788 --> 01:03:08,291
that can spare you from

1218
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:10,855
actually writing html inline html

1219
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:14,100
code in the background but yeah

1220
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,524
yeah um yeah now there's some

1221
01:03:17,524 --> 01:03:19,067
cool things at least things that

1222
01:03:19,908 --> 01:03:25,015
look cool uh we go for badges

1223
01:03:25,015 --> 01:03:26,795
badges what is a badge so if i

1224
01:03:26,795 --> 01:03:30,400
put something like this in my, um,

1225
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,565
uh, uh, in my code, in my, uh, read me,

1226
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:36,247
well, this is actually a link

1227
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:39,051
and this is a link, uh,

1228
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:42,616
to a little, uh, picture.

1229
01:03:42,616 --> 01:03:44,919
So you can see that there are links.

1230
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:46,801
Uh, so this will be just a link.

1231
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:47,222
Okay.

1232
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:49,204
If you remove the exclamation mark,

1233
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:50,586
but with the exclamation mark,

1234
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:53,850
this is a link, uh, to a picture.

1235
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,893
Let's look how it looks like.

1236
01:03:55,893 --> 01:03:56,478
Okay.

1237
01:03:56,478 --> 01:03:59,402
and yeah so here then i have

1238
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,184
a link to a to a picture

1239
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:02,326
that it will be rendered just

1240
01:04:02,326 --> 01:04:03,768
like a picture picture and i can

1241
01:04:03,768 --> 01:04:07,593
if you want i can uh click on it okay

1242
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,875
and well but it's not that

1243
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:10,277
i get much out of this it's

1244
01:04:10,277 --> 01:04:14,263
just a picture okay um but i

1245
01:04:14,263 --> 01:04:18,128
can also create um something a

1246
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:23,849
bit more fancy which is like a a picture

1247
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:26,152
that links to something else,

1248
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:26,872
to another page.

1249
01:04:26,872 --> 01:04:27,934
For example, here I have

1250
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:30,437
created, I have the picture

1251
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:34,561
that I had described above that

1252
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:40,829
links to this other address, example.org.

1253
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:43,492
So let's have a look, preview.

1254
01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:44,773
And yeah, so the first one

1255
01:04:44,773 --> 01:04:49,018
is the one that has no real link attached to it.

1256
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:54,089
The second has instead a link to another

1257
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:56,915
page to another page, which is example.org.

1258
01:04:58,638 --> 01:04:59,800
This can be useful if you

1259
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,127
want to have some, you will

1260
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:06,314
see badges later, but the idea

1261
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:11,909
is these badges are quick

1262
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:13,612
to find entry points to

1263
01:05:13,612 --> 01:05:17,217
some other things on the web, which could be,

1264
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,519
you know, if you have a test suit,

1265
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:21,384
if you have like, yeah, if

1266
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,245
you have a test suit, for

1267
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:24,108
example, you want to link there

1268
01:05:24,108 --> 01:05:26,292
the results of your test suit, you can do that.

1269
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:27,293
If you have some coverage

1270
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:29,797
reports, if you have other things, if you have,

1271
01:05:29,797 --> 01:05:34,764
like a way to say if

1272
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,605
it's very positive to add

1273
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:37,608
some Jupyter notebooks and you want

1274
01:05:37,608 --> 01:05:41,874
to link a binder set up so

1275
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:42,755
that you can run those

1276
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:44,818
Jupyter notebooks interactively in the web.

1277
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:48,403
Yeah, you can put these links using,

1278
01:05:49,965 --> 01:05:51,126
you can have these kind

1279
01:05:51,126 --> 01:05:52,789
of links with badges instead

1280
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:53,850
of just having plain links.

1281
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:57,375
Yeah.

1282
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:57,475
Yeah.

1283
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:03,051
So now we have some time for an exercise.

1284
01:06:03,051 --> 01:06:05,840
So let's have a look at, I

1285
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,703
need to get back to this.

1286
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:10,435
So we have an exercise block, let's say.

1287
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:13,874
There are these two exercises,

1288
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:15,897
README 2 and README 3.

1289
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,302
In the first case, if you

1290
01:06:18,302 --> 01:06:22,249
have a project on your own with the README,

1291
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:23,230
you may want to spend

1292
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,733
some time improving it or

1293
01:06:24,733 --> 01:06:27,278
just testing some features that

1294
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:30,964
we just shown on your own README file.

1295
01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:34,327
If you don't own a project, I don't know,

1296
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:35,989
for any other reason, this

1297
01:06:35,989 --> 01:06:37,812
thing doesn't work for you, you

1298
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:41,277
can choose a README for a project

1299
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:43,340
that you have used, okay, and

1300
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:49,389
write in the notes what other strengths

1301
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,592
and what you think you would

1302
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:53,615
change or, you know, some

1303
01:06:53,615 --> 01:06:56,980
observations about this in the

1304
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,265
notes, which I will switch to.

1305
01:07:00,265 --> 01:07:03,630
And, yeah.

1306
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:04,280
Yeah.

1307
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,287
For those of you who want to discuss,

1308
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:12,514
which have no clear idea what to discuss,

1309
01:07:12,514 --> 01:07:13,936
we do have actually a

1310
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:18,444
suggestion of a relatively nice...

1311
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:20,848
Yeah, I'm adding them to the notes.

1312
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:22,290
To the notes, yeah.

1313
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,552
So I will say, as we

1314
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:25,335
switch now to the notes,

1315
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:27,218
let's scroll down, okay?

1316
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:30,638
So,

1317
01:07:30,638 --> 01:07:32,260
We should have a 10-minute

1318
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,181
exercise break for this.

1319
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:40,390
I'll put also here in the

1320
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,893
notes a link to the exercises.

1321
01:07:45,537 --> 01:07:48,981
Yeah, so let's let you do this.

1322
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,544
So the exercises are, wait,

1323
01:07:51,544 --> 01:07:53,426
I'll close this one, just

1324
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:57,912
to confuse anybody, leave page, and then here.

1325
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:02,230
So either draft or improve a

1326
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,774
README of a project or comment

1327
01:08:04,774 --> 01:08:07,278
on a README that you have used.

1328
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:08,720
If you have nothing to

1329
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,223
comment on, please use the link

1330
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:10,924
that we provide here.

1331
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:22,482
So let's see each other in 10 minutes.

1332
01:18:18,436 --> 01:18:19,097
And we are back.

1333
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:27,649
So I guess we can look at,

1334
01:18:31,235 --> 01:18:33,338
can have a look at the notes.

1335
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:34,700
Okay, there have been some

1336
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,901
questions about the badges.

1337
01:18:38,425 --> 01:18:41,990
I think we've been discussing

1338
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:46,533
those, answer them.

1339
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:48,376
Okay, so there's this question about

1340
01:18:48,376 --> 01:18:50,258
what tools can I use

1341
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:51,921
to properly render markup language

1342
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:53,303
on a README file on my computer?

1343
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:57,549
Well, maybe README is not exactly,

1344
01:18:57,549 --> 01:18:58,770
but if you are using, well,

1345
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,232
we can do Sphinx, and then

1346
01:19:00,232 --> 01:19:02,796
you can render markdown files

1347
01:19:02,796 --> 01:19:05,139
in the Sphinx documentation on your computer.

1348
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:06,922
We'll show how to do this.

1349
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:12,810
Regarding the exercises, so our...

1350
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:20,576
Let's have a look at this readme file.

1351
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:23,161
This is an example that

1352
01:19:23,161 --> 01:19:26,348
[name] has found, and I

1353
01:19:26,348 --> 01:19:30,757
think it's an interesting one.

1354
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:34,444
What would you say, [name]?

1355
01:19:35,723 --> 01:19:39,348
Yeah, I would say this

1356
01:19:39,348 --> 01:19:42,011
project's purpose is very obvious.

1357
01:19:42,993 --> 01:19:45,556
It's a tool you use to

1358
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:51,023
convert PDF files to some

1359
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:52,686
machine readable formats like

1360
01:19:52,686 --> 01:19:55,550
Markdown, HTML, or JSON.

1361
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,432
So I think the project

1362
01:19:57,432 --> 01:20:00,209
introduction is very easy to read.

1363
01:20:00,209 --> 01:20:03,593
Yeah, I think I would have

1364
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:05,396
liked to put the project

1365
01:20:05,396 --> 01:20:08,900
introduction above, just before the changelog.

1366
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,143
I like the changelog, very nice.

1367
01:20:11,143 --> 01:20:12,965
But I would like to put it, I mean,

1368
01:20:12,965 --> 01:20:14,807
just because if I know that

1369
01:20:15,668 --> 01:20:18,392
what this is, okay, then I

1370
01:20:18,392 --> 01:20:19,153
don't need the introduction.

1371
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:20,595
But if I land on this

1372
01:20:20,595 --> 01:20:22,016
page like this and say, okay, so.

1373
01:20:22,857 --> 01:20:24,179
Yeah, it's more natural to have

1374
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:26,500
it at the beginning.

1375
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,926
Yeah, but I guess because I'm a user

1376
01:20:28,926 --> 01:20:29,728
that does not know what

1377
01:20:29,728 --> 01:20:31,873
this project is about, I guess.

1378
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:35,882
Instead, if I could be a user

1379
01:20:35,882 --> 01:20:37,145
and other users, maybe they

1380
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:38,549
would like to see the changelog first.

1381
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:42,937
And we can see a lot of badges here.

1382
01:20:42,937 --> 01:20:44,719
quite yeah it's a really

1383
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:48,103
colorful uh yeah yeah and yeah you can see

1384
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:50,226
for example here open issues that is 100

1385
01:20:50,226 --> 01:20:51,648
so if you click there then

1386
01:20:51,648 --> 01:20:53,550
it will bring you to the uh

1387
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,894
to the issue page so i

1388
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,657
think that these badges are

1389
01:20:58,657 --> 01:21:02,041
provided by github uh yeah this

1390
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:04,524
one open issues close the issues

1391
01:21:04,524 --> 01:21:06,907
uh then for example this opening

1392
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:09,190
call up uh yeah possibly it's

1393
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:10,311
a a badge that would

1394
01:21:11,185 --> 01:21:13,168
possibly provided by call up.

1395
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:13,709
Let's see.

1396
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:14,810
I mean, you can actually see

1397
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:17,394
if you look at this, read me where

1398
01:21:18,836 --> 01:21:20,698
what what is so you can see that

1399
01:21:20,698 --> 01:21:22,541
that link that this points to

1400
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:26,667
but you can also see the the image

1401
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:28,269
where the image comes from,

1402
01:21:28,269 --> 01:21:29,891
just referring to some questions

1403
01:21:29,891 --> 01:21:31,614
that we had in the past before.

1404
01:21:31,614 --> 01:21:32,313
Yes.

1405
01:21:32,313 --> 01:21:34,696
We have a question in the notes.

1406
01:21:34,696 --> 01:21:36,699
One of the readmes has link

1407
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:39,082
to the wiki in the GitHub repo.

1408
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:42,105
I suppose it's talking about

1409
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:44,028
this readme, the ManorU.

1410
01:21:44,028 --> 01:21:47,152
Is this a good idea?

1411
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:50,957
Well, I would say yes.

1412
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:54,922
Yeah, I think this is a deep wiki.

1413
01:21:54,922 --> 01:21:59,498
If you go a bit upper, a bit lower, sorry.

1414
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,021
with lower so maybe i can search

1415
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:03,004
for wiki with control f yes

1416
01:22:03,004 --> 01:22:07,992
it has a link to this um i

1417
01:22:07,992 --> 01:22:09,956
would say it is a good idea

1418
01:22:09,956 --> 01:22:12,660
because you can't have

1419
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,804
a very long readme file it

1420
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:16,907
will be difficult to read if

1421
01:22:16,907 --> 01:22:19,572
you have something more some more

1422
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:23,512
content and a deep wiki is one of the options

1423
01:22:23,512 --> 01:22:25,397
What do you think?

1424
01:22:25,397 --> 01:22:27,221
I would say that the thing is

1425
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:29,166
that a wiki, I mean, we

1426
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:31,030
said that we don't like wikis.

1427
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,672
It's not that we don't

1428
01:22:31,672 --> 01:22:32,694
like wikis, it's just that

1429
01:22:32,694 --> 01:22:34,739
wikis have the problem that may

1430
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:37,365
not be, they may be a bit

1431
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:39,712
hard to keep in sync with the code.

1432
01:22:39,712 --> 01:22:41,054
And so what I can say here is

1433
01:22:41,054 --> 01:22:42,195
that it makes sense to have

1434
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:44,338
a link to a wiki or

1435
01:22:44,338 --> 01:22:47,943
even to have any information, any

1436
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:50,307
content in a wiki if it

1437
01:22:50,307 --> 01:22:52,690
doesn't change very often or

1438
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:55,274
if it's something very stable, let's say.

1439
01:22:56,635 --> 01:22:58,318
Yeah, but in general, if you

1440
01:22:58,318 --> 01:23:01,282
have much more content than

1441
01:23:01,282 --> 01:23:04,046
link to another more structured,

1442
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,918
easy to navigate site,

1443
01:23:05,918 --> 01:23:07,782
documentation is a good idea

1444
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:11,711
but maybe wiki is not the best choice yeah

1445
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:13,515
but we have many other options

1446
01:23:13,515 --> 01:23:15,138
so there are trade-offs wikis

1447
01:23:15,138 --> 01:23:17,022
are easy to modify for

1448
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:19,327
non-developers and uh that's why

1449
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:24,920
they exist basically yes okay um

1450
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,165
I think we've been active for one hour

1451
01:23:29,165 --> 01:23:33,150
and I think we deserve,

1452
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,572
everybody here deserves a little

1453
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:36,474
break because we are facing

1454
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:37,696
the computer we're sitting in.

1455
01:23:37,696 --> 01:23:42,021
So I guess we will have a 10-minute break.

1456
01:23:42,021 --> 01:23:43,162
And during this break, I

1457
01:23:43,162 --> 01:23:44,844
would recommend really for you

1458
01:23:44,844 --> 01:23:46,767
to reactivate your cardiovascular

1459
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:49,570
system or whatever it works for you.

1460
01:23:50,371 --> 01:23:53,475
But yeah, so...

1461
01:23:54,468 --> 01:23:55,932
anything we need to say before

1462
01:23:55,932 --> 01:23:58,799
that we just say i think

1463
01:23:58,799 --> 01:24:01,967
that that's that's all uh maybe

1464
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:04,975
let's see each other uh in

1465
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:11,211
10 minutes great so then bye bye

1466
01:35:08,658 --> 01:35:09,078
Hello.

1467
01:35:11,161 --> 01:35:12,042
Welcome back.

1468
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:14,445
I hope you had a refreshing break.

1469
01:35:15,947 --> 01:35:19,871
So I need to apologize possibly

1470
01:35:19,871 --> 01:35:22,074
for not being too clear about

1471
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:24,257
what needs to be done in this exercise.

1472
01:35:24,257 --> 01:35:26,559
I will try to be clear in what follows.

1473
01:35:28,141 --> 01:35:31,285
So before we move on to other topics,

1474
01:35:32,206 --> 01:35:33,968
we have still to say one

1475
01:35:33,968 --> 01:35:37,784
thing about readme files and

1476
01:35:37,784 --> 01:35:41,069
especially about markdown and

1477
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:42,151
different formats.

1478
01:35:42,151 --> 01:35:44,735
So if your README file is

1479
01:35:44,735 --> 01:35:45,797
very long, you may want to

1480
01:35:45,797 --> 01:35:47,900
have a table of content there.

1481
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:50,464
And GitHub use at least

1482
01:35:50,464 --> 01:35:52,347
to automatically generate a table

1483
01:35:52,347 --> 01:35:54,170
of content for README files.

1484
01:35:55,352 --> 01:35:58,757
And on GitLab instead, you

1485
01:35:58,757 --> 01:36:01,602
may have to generate a table

1486
01:36:01,602 --> 01:36:05,428
of content using this little

1487
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:08,910
directive here let's say and in

1488
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:11,092
if you instead are using

1489
01:36:11,092 --> 01:36:15,397
a restructure text then you you

1490
01:36:15,397 --> 01:36:18,360
can use this this snippet of

1491
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,763
code let's say by adding at

1492
01:36:20,763 --> 01:36:23,145
some point in your in your

1493
01:36:23,145 --> 01:36:31,480
readme this this code okay so in

1494
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,862
Now we are going to talk

1495
01:36:32,862 --> 01:36:35,005
about something a bit more complex

1496
01:36:35,005 --> 01:36:36,707
and more powerful than readme files,

1497
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:41,234
which is Sphinx, which is

1498
01:36:41,234 --> 01:36:44,458
one of those documentation generators

1499
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:45,540
that we mentioned before.

1500
01:36:47,022 --> 01:36:48,804
And so the objectives for

1501
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:51,147
this section is to understand

1502
01:36:51,147 --> 01:36:52,950
how static site generators build

1503
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:54,152
website out of plain text

1504
01:36:54,152 --> 01:36:55,834
files, not only Sphinx, but

1505
01:36:56,635 --> 01:36:59,982
there's many other siblings, let's say.

1506
01:36:59,982 --> 01:37:04,809
And we are going to do it.

1507
01:37:04,809 --> 01:37:07,273
We are going to create an

1508
01:37:07,273 --> 01:37:13,823
example of a documentation

1509
01:37:13,823 --> 01:37:16,868
system, documentation corpus with Sphinx.

1510
01:37:16,868 --> 01:37:17,769
And we are going to

1511
01:37:17,769 --> 01:37:19,051
learn some Markdown along the

1512
01:37:19,051 --> 01:37:22,817
way, some special kind of Markdown.

1513
01:37:23,624 --> 01:37:24,646
One thing to notice is

1514
01:37:24,646 --> 01:37:27,710
that actually this very lesson

1515
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,233
that I'm sharing now, it's

1516
01:37:29,233 --> 01:37:31,456
been built with Sphinx.

1517
01:37:31,456 --> 01:37:34,360
So it's something that, so this is,

1518
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,665
if you want, basically in

1519
01:37:37,665 --> 01:37:39,689
front of your very high eyes,

1520
01:37:39,689 --> 01:37:43,294
there is a real example of Sphinx.

1521
01:37:46,219 --> 01:37:50,928
So I'll guide you through a...

1522
01:37:50,928 --> 01:37:52,577
series of steps to create

1523
01:37:52,577 --> 01:37:56,096
your first Sphinx project.

1524
01:37:56,096 --> 01:37:56,196
Okay.

1525
01:37:57,492 --> 01:37:58,814
And in order to do that,

1526
01:37:58,814 --> 01:38:01,018
though, I'm going to, first of

1527
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:05,025
all, switch my share to a

1528
01:38:05,025 --> 01:38:09,633
terminal where I will run some commands.

1529
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:11,857
And in order for you to follow along,

1530
01:38:11,857 --> 01:38:13,781
you should have a code

1531
01:38:13,781 --> 01:38:16,105
refinery conda environment installed.

1532
01:38:17,347 --> 01:38:20,252
And in the notes, we have

1533
01:38:20,252 --> 01:38:22,656
that there should be already some commands.

1534
01:38:23,969 --> 01:38:28,123
links that just you know to

1535
01:38:28,123 --> 01:38:29,788
make sure you can follow along

1536
01:38:29,788 --> 01:38:30,892
if you have problems maybe you

1537
01:38:30,892 --> 01:38:33,962
can ask in the in the zoom support room

1538
01:38:36,187 --> 01:38:38,691
One thing I need to say

1539
01:38:38,691 --> 01:38:40,593
is that Conda may be not the

1540
01:38:40,593 --> 01:38:42,176
only way you have to

1541
01:38:42,176 --> 01:38:44,740
install the accessory software for

1542
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,021
this, but it's the most

1543
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:49,066
convenient, so that's why we chose that.

1544
01:38:50,628 --> 01:38:52,090
I will now keep the notes

1545
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:55,776
aside and show you an

1546
01:38:55,776 --> 01:39:01,128
empty terminal, which is...

1547
01:39:01,128 --> 01:39:02,569
a bit daunting for some people,

1548
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:04,851
but that's a very natural

1549
01:39:04,851 --> 01:39:07,214
way to interact with a computer,

1550
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:08,455
at least for me.

1551
01:39:08,455 --> 01:39:10,116
And I'm going to type some commands.

1552
01:39:10,116 --> 01:39:13,119
So first of all, I need

1553
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:21,206
to conda activate code refinery.

1554
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:22,207
So in this way, I

1555
01:39:22,207 --> 01:39:24,910
activate the conda environment

1556
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:27,192
for code refinery, and this will

1557
01:39:27,192 --> 01:39:30,119
give me the possibility to use the

1558
01:39:30,119 --> 01:39:31,141
the commands I want to

1559
01:39:31,141 --> 01:39:32,925
use, the things around Sphinx, basically.

1560
01:39:34,668 --> 01:39:35,971
You see that my prompt

1561
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:39,137
has changed here, and I'm happy about that.

1562
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,706
So we should check just

1563
01:39:43,706 --> 01:39:45,149
if Python is available.

1564
01:39:45,149 --> 01:39:46,532
These are commands that you

1565
01:39:46,532 --> 01:39:48,296
should run on your, if you

1566
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:50,019
want to follow along, I'm going

1567
01:39:50,019 --> 01:39:51,787
to be quite slow.

1568
01:39:51,787 --> 01:39:53,509
You should try to type

1569
01:39:53,509 --> 01:39:55,772
these commands and see if there's any error.

1570
01:39:55,772 --> 01:39:58,616
So your output could vary a little,

1571
01:39:58,616 --> 01:39:59,777
but you shouldn't see any

1572
01:39:59,777 --> 01:40:01,980
errors when you run these few

1573
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:06,045
commands that I'm going to type.

1574
01:40:06,045 --> 01:40:08,188
Python version.

1575
01:40:10,891 --> 01:40:11,932
This is just to check

1576
01:40:11,932 --> 01:40:14,716
that Python is installed and works.

1577
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,482
Then the other thing we need

1578
01:40:19,482 --> 01:40:21,304
to look at is Sphinx build.

1579
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:33,037
Let's check the version again.

1580
01:40:36,223 --> 01:40:38,267
Here I have version 8.2.

1581
01:40:41,193 --> 01:40:43,898
You may have a different

1582
01:40:43,898 --> 01:40:45,722
version, it's still okay.

1583
01:40:54,427 --> 01:40:56,689
Then another thing we need to

1584
01:40:57,770 --> 01:40:59,752
use is the so-called Sphinx Quick Start.

1585
01:41:14,304 --> 01:41:15,305
It's the same version.

1586
01:41:15,305 --> 01:41:15,945
It's expected.

1587
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:20,409
Okay.

1588
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:20,969
And the last thing.

1589
01:41:22,471 --> 01:41:23,952
Sorry, someone else.

1590
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:24,667
Oh.

1591
01:41:24,667 --> 01:41:31,796
Yeah, I have the version 7.4,

1592
01:41:32,597 --> 01:41:34,540
but it also works.

1593
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:45,775
Yeah, by checking versions, if

1594
01:41:45,775 --> 01:41:49,239
we spot something strange, we may

1595
01:41:49,239 --> 01:41:53,325
know it may come from the version difference.

1596
01:41:53,325 --> 01:41:53,425
Yeah.

1597
01:41:58,838 --> 01:42:01,882
And after that, we will

1598
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:06,629
run some small command, some

1599
01:42:06,629 --> 01:42:10,133
simple thing to check out if

1600
01:42:10,133 --> 01:42:13,037
we have the necessary extensions

1601
01:42:13,037 --> 01:42:16,642
of Sphinx also installed here.

1602
01:42:16,642 --> 01:42:18,165
Yeah, with the Python command.

1603
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:20,608
Yeah, this is the shortest

1604
01:42:20,608 --> 01:42:23,332
possible Python program, let's say.

1605
01:42:23,332 --> 01:42:26,596
If it works without errors,

1606
01:42:26,596 --> 01:42:28,488
then it means that we are okay.

1607
01:42:28,488 --> 01:42:33,072
And now, if my throat allows

1608
01:42:33,072 --> 01:42:36,996
me, we should be able to

1609
01:42:36,996 --> 01:42:42,601
start our first Sphinx project.

1610
01:42:44,423 --> 01:42:46,485
So for that, I will create

1611
01:42:46,485 --> 01:42:54,432
a new directory called doc-example.

1612
01:42:54,432 --> 01:42:57,007
I will also need to change my directory.

1613
01:42:57,007 --> 01:42:58,429
my current directory to that.

1614
01:43:02,215 --> 01:43:03,758
So that I am inside it.

1615
01:43:03,758 --> 01:43:06,703
This is very important.

1616
01:43:07,825 --> 01:43:09,808
And then I can invoke

1617
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:12,031
this command, Sphinx quick start

1618
01:43:12,031 --> 01:43:15,617
that I already used before.

1619
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:20,706
Sphinx dash quick start

1620
01:43:20,706 --> 01:43:23,470
without arguments this time.

1621
01:43:24,462 --> 01:43:27,607
This command is going to

1622
01:43:27,607 --> 01:43:30,411
give me an interactive, a

1623
01:43:30,411 --> 01:43:32,113
quick interactive, a short

1624
01:43:32,113 --> 01:43:34,336
interactive session where it asks

1625
01:43:34,336 --> 01:43:37,821
me some questions and I'll show you.

1626
01:43:39,023 --> 01:43:42,448
So I will just zoom out

1627
01:43:42,448 --> 01:43:44,527
a little so that it's more readable.

1628
01:43:44,527 --> 01:43:47,972
So it will ask me if

1629
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:49,774
we want to separate the source

1630
01:43:49,774 --> 01:43:50,895
and the build directories.

1631
01:43:50,895 --> 01:43:52,578
So the source for the documentation

1632
01:43:52,578 --> 01:43:53,579
and for the build,

1633
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:55,041
because the documentation is going

1634
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:57,404
to be built in HTML files.

1635
01:43:58,846 --> 01:44:01,249
It's okay if we accept

1636
01:44:01,249 --> 01:44:03,332
the default option, which is no,

1637
01:44:03,332 --> 01:44:04,854
so we don't split anything.

1638
01:44:05,855 --> 01:44:07,758
Then project name.

1639
01:44:07,758 --> 01:44:09,320
So here I need to type something.

1640
01:44:11,022 --> 01:44:12,424
I will say Sphinx test.

1641
01:44:13,703 --> 01:44:17,529
test okay and it's okay

1642
01:44:17,529 --> 01:44:19,852
author name there could be one

1643
01:44:19,852 --> 01:44:21,154
other one i will just put

1644
01:44:21,154 --> 01:44:26,242
my name here then enter project

1645
01:44:26,242 --> 01:44:29,047
release i should possibly give a

1646
01:44:29,047 --> 01:44:31,250
version here i will put 0.1

1647
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:40,298
of course this is not a it's just a

1648
01:44:40,298 --> 01:44:40,999
an example.

1649
01:44:44,504 --> 01:44:44,824
Okay.

1650
01:44:44,824 --> 01:44:45,205
0.1.

1651
01:44:45,205 --> 01:44:48,329
And then I have another

1652
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:49,952
question here, which is about

1653
01:44:49,952 --> 01:44:50,893
the project language.

1654
01:44:51,754 --> 01:44:53,817
I will make sure it's visible.

1655
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:57,102
English is okay.

1656
01:44:57,102 --> 01:44:57,763
Okay.

1657
01:44:57,763 --> 01:44:59,365
So now I got back my

1658
01:44:59,365 --> 01:45:01,308
prompt, my shell prompt.

1659
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,791
And if I look at the

1660
01:45:03,791 --> 01:45:05,794
content of the current directory,

1661
01:45:05,794 --> 01:45:07,196
I see that something has

1662
01:45:07,196 --> 01:45:09,800
been created by Sphinx.

1663
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:09,900
Okay.

1664
01:45:12,091 --> 01:45:16,936
So I will comment on some of these.

1665
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:18,257
There's conf.py.

1666
01:45:18,257 --> 01:45:20,059
So Sphinx is a Python

1667
01:45:20,059 --> 01:45:23,883
package that still works with Python.

1668
01:45:23,883 --> 01:45:24,984
So it needs Python.

1669
01:45:24,984 --> 01:45:28,748
Conf.py contains the configuration

1670
01:45:28,748 --> 01:45:30,990
of my project, which extensions

1671
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,392
I need, other things.

1672
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:34,654
So a lot of the things

1673
01:45:34,654 --> 01:45:38,939
that you decide here,

1674
01:45:38,939 --> 01:45:41,043
you tell the quick start

1675
01:45:41,885 --> 01:45:44,710
facility about they're going to end

1676
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:46,914
up in this configuration.py file,

1677
01:45:46,914 --> 01:45:47,836
and you may have to change

1678
01:45:47,836 --> 01:45:49,198
it later if you want to add

1679
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:53,426
some, to have some more features, let's say.

1680
01:45:53,426 --> 01:45:58,095
There's index.rst, possibly the

1681
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:01,119
most important file here it's

1682
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:02,761
the like the root of

1683
01:46:02,761 --> 01:46:04,022
the documentation here it's the

1684
01:46:04,022 --> 01:46:05,664
first page of the documentation

1685
01:46:05,664 --> 01:46:07,226
and it also will contain all

1686
01:46:07,226 --> 01:46:08,708
the links to the other parts

1687
01:46:08,708 --> 01:46:11,872
of it okay then there is

1688
01:46:11,872 --> 01:46:14,235
a directory called underscore build

1689
01:46:15,396 --> 01:46:17,058
which is the one in by

1690
01:46:17,058 --> 01:46:20,402
default the the where the the

1691
01:46:20,402 --> 01:46:26,530
html files are going to to end and what else uh

1692
01:46:27,961 --> 01:46:30,305
Yeah, okay, so there's a Makefile.

1693
01:46:30,305 --> 01:46:32,870
Makefile is something that you

1694
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:36,977
can use on Linux and macOS.

1695
01:46:37,979 --> 01:46:39,922
And it contains, we're not going

1696
01:46:39,922 --> 01:46:41,184
to use it today, but in

1697
01:46:41,184 --> 01:46:42,427
principle, there's a list of

1698
01:46:42,427 --> 01:46:43,569
commands you can use to

1699
01:46:43,569 --> 01:46:46,434
automatically generate the documentation

1700
01:46:46,434 --> 01:46:48,958
with just Make and something.

1701
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:51,102
And Make.bat is something for

1702
01:46:51,102 --> 01:46:52,264
Windows users instead.

1703
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:55,846
Uh, but yeah.

1704
01:46:55,846 --> 01:46:56,568
Okay.

1705
01:46:56,568 --> 01:46:59,054
So what am I going to have a look at now?

1706
01:46:59,054 --> 01:47:00,497
It's we're going to look at,

1707
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:03,084
uh, index dot RST.

1708
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:06,211
Now in what follows, uh, I'm

1709
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:10,081
going to, um, to use an editor.

1710
01:47:10,081 --> 01:47:12,083
And the editor I use is

1711
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:13,485
Vim, because I like it.

1712
01:47:14,546 --> 01:47:16,428
But you can use any editor you want.

1713
01:47:16,428 --> 01:47:17,590
So when you see Vim, you

1714
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:18,571
don't have to type Vim.

1715
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:21,234
You can open it with, let's say, code.

1716
01:47:21,234 --> 01:47:23,076
If you want to use Visual

1717
01:47:23,076 --> 01:47:28,322
Studio Code, you can use code, for example.

1718
01:47:29,884 --> 01:47:32,347
So what I want to do now

1719
01:47:32,347 --> 01:47:37,313
is to have a look at the content of indexed.rst.

1720
01:47:38,955 --> 01:47:39,075
Okay?

1721
01:47:41,418 --> 01:47:43,040
There's also nano.

1722
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:43,620
Let's do this.

1723
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,701
I will use nano because

1724
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:47,684
I don't want anybody of you to

1725
01:47:47,684 --> 01:47:51,888
end up in Vim and become a prisoner of that.

1726
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:57,493
So nano index.rst.

1727
01:47:58,374 --> 01:48:00,476
So this is a way to open it with nano.

1728
01:48:01,777 --> 01:48:02,538
Okay.

1729
01:48:02,538 --> 01:48:08,944
So this is the skeleton of a...

1730
01:48:10,055 --> 01:48:12,940
of an index file of the main page.

1731
01:48:14,222 --> 01:48:18,348
So it has quite some

1732
01:48:19,811 --> 01:48:21,674
like some documentation, some

1733
01:48:21,674 --> 01:48:23,958
like some directives that actually

1734
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:24,799
not going to be printed.

1735
01:48:25,941 --> 01:48:29,567
But then there is this title line.

1736
01:48:29,567 --> 01:48:30,628
Okay.

1737
01:48:30,628 --> 01:48:31,189
A paragraph.

1738
01:48:32,151 --> 01:48:33,934
There's also a link.

1739
01:48:33,934 --> 01:48:34,304
Okay.

1740
01:48:34,304 --> 01:48:37,487
And then there is a table of content here,

1741
01:48:37,487 --> 01:48:40,350
actually a tree, something which

1742
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:43,813
is a table of content tree.

1743
01:48:43,813 --> 01:48:44,054
Okay.

1744
01:48:44,934 --> 01:48:47,217
And so if you have an

1745
01:48:47,217 --> 01:48:49,439
older version of Sphinx

1746
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:51,761
Quickstart, actually you get

1747
01:48:51,761 --> 01:48:54,384
some additional content here, which

1748
01:48:54,384 --> 01:48:55,084
we do not care.

1749
01:48:55,084 --> 01:48:57,727
So you could have an index and table,

1750
01:48:57,727 --> 01:49:00,069
indices and tables section, but

1751
01:49:00,069 --> 01:49:00,930
we don't need it.

1752
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:02,912
So you can remove it.

1753
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:03,616
Okay.

1754
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,199
So what I'm going to do now is,

1755
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,160
since I want to add some

1756
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:09,842
content to the documentation to show

1757
01:49:09,842 --> 01:49:12,184
what are the possibilities, I

1758
01:49:12,184 --> 01:49:22,033
will add here a file name called somefeature.md.

1759
01:49:22,874 --> 01:49:26,637
Maybe this is a file called

1760
01:49:26,637 --> 01:49:27,918
in a markdown file.

1761
01:49:27,918 --> 01:49:29,800
So this is just a name.

1762
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,417
I will create the file later.

1763
01:49:33,417 --> 01:49:35,399
So this, in this file,

1764
01:49:35,399 --> 01:49:38,181
call some feature.md, I may

1765
01:49:38,181 --> 01:49:40,823
be discussing, describing the feature

1766
01:49:40,823 --> 01:49:42,965
of my code.

1767
01:49:42,965 --> 01:49:44,647
That's it.

1768
01:49:44,647 --> 01:49:48,770
One thing to notice, I'm typing it here,

1769
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:51,373
and it needs to be indented

1770
01:49:51,373 --> 01:49:53,034
at the same level as caption.

1771
01:49:53,034 --> 01:49:55,196
So here there are three

1772
01:49:55,196 --> 01:50:00,120
empty, three spaces, and before

1773
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:01,882
caption here, and there needs

1774
01:50:01,882 --> 01:50:03,590
to be three spaces here as well.

1775
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:05,833
So this is restructured

1776
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:07,776
text and restructured text is

1777
01:50:08,838 --> 01:50:15,988
like white space like Python.

1778
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:21,437
I can also add a space if I want just

1779
01:50:21,437 --> 01:50:23,159
for clarity, but there needs

1780
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:25,903
to be always the same indentation level.

1781
01:50:27,145 --> 01:50:31,892
And now I can

1782
01:50:33,205 --> 01:50:37,650
Save this in whatever way

1783
01:50:39,111 --> 01:50:40,493
my editor allows me to do so.

1784
01:50:41,414 --> 01:50:43,576
And save and exit.

1785
01:50:43,576 --> 01:50:45,098
Now I need to open

1786
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:50,164
conf.py, the configuration file.

1787
01:50:51,165 --> 01:50:53,267
And I need to go down to

1788
01:50:53,267 --> 01:50:56,170
the line where the extensions are listed.

1789
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:58,613
And the extension I need to

1790
01:50:58,613 --> 01:51:02,537
add here is the myst.

1791
01:51:03,344 --> 01:51:07,096
my st parser okay so this

1792
01:51:07,096 --> 01:51:11,389
is the extension that i need uh in order

1793
01:51:11,389 --> 01:51:13,877
for sphinx to uh to

1794
01:51:13,877 --> 01:51:15,964
parse the markdown files i'm

1795
01:51:15,964 --> 01:51:17,067
going to create okay

1796
01:51:19,021 --> 01:51:20,423
So the syntax here is

1797
01:51:20,423 --> 01:51:22,505
exactly Python syntax, right?

1798
01:51:22,505 --> 01:51:23,926
It's a dictionary in Python.

1799
01:51:23,926 --> 01:51:25,588
Yes, yeah.

1800
01:51:25,588 --> 01:51:27,670
So actually, extensions, in this case,

1801
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:31,495
it's a list of strings, and

1802
01:51:31,495 --> 01:51:35,799
each string is the name of a package, okay?

1803
01:51:35,799 --> 01:51:39,824
And I will save and exit, okay?

1804
01:51:39,824 --> 01:51:42,166
So these are the two files I've modified.

1805
01:51:42,166 --> 01:51:46,122
First, index.rsc, adding...

1806
01:51:46,122 --> 01:51:49,766
somefeatures.md and then adding

1807
01:51:49,766 --> 01:51:55,032
conf.py okay good and now I mentioned

1808
01:51:55,032 --> 01:51:57,515
before I wanted to add

1809
01:51:57,515 --> 01:52:00,418
a file called somefeatures.md so

1810
01:52:00,418 --> 01:52:08,487
I will do exactly that open

1811
01:52:08,487 --> 01:52:11,291
this plain text file and in

1812
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:13,915
the interest of time I will go to the notes

1813
01:52:13,915 --> 01:52:16,197
which I can possibly show here

1814
01:52:16,197 --> 01:52:20,300
and take, wait, I take this

1815
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:24,844
text here that is available, copy it.

1816
01:52:24,844 --> 01:52:27,487
There's actually a copy button,

1817
01:52:27,487 --> 01:52:29,548
copy that and paste it here.

1818
01:52:34,252 --> 01:52:34,372
Okay.

1819
01:52:34,372 --> 01:52:36,614
And I leave it like this,

1820
01:52:36,614 --> 01:52:38,496
but maybe I should comment a bit.

1821
01:52:38,496 --> 01:52:39,777
So you see there are like,

1822
01:52:39,777 --> 01:52:43,180
there's a main title of the,

1823
01:52:44,223 --> 01:52:46,666
of the file, let's say that

1824
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:48,368
of the page, notice that this

1825
01:52:48,368 --> 01:52:49,229
is a different thing.

1826
01:52:49,229 --> 01:52:50,090
This is a markdown.

1827
01:52:51,011 --> 01:52:53,534
It's not, it's not restructured text now.

1828
01:52:54,695 --> 01:52:59,300
So the main title, title of the subsection,

1829
01:53:00,322 --> 01:53:02,364
and then the paragraph and

1830
01:53:02,364 --> 01:53:08,171
then there are there's like a

1831
01:53:08,171 --> 01:53:09,991
list, there are lists.

1832
01:53:09,991 --> 01:53:11,894
One thing to notice that

1833
01:53:11,894 --> 01:53:14,358
the empty surrounding lines are

1834
01:53:14,358 --> 01:53:19,167
required in this flavor markdown,

1835
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:22,613
for you to understand that

1836
01:53:22,613 --> 01:53:25,958
these are items in the same list.

1837
01:53:29,765 --> 01:53:30,827
So, we need to be careful

1838
01:53:30,827 --> 01:53:31,728
about white space here.

1839
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:34,513
So, we'll save now.

1840
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:36,391
and exit.

1841
01:53:39,537 --> 01:53:42,103
I will clear my terminal and

1842
01:53:42,103 --> 01:53:45,910
show again the content of this directory.

1843
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:52,964
So now everything should be fine.

1844
01:53:52,964 --> 01:53:54,868
If I want, I can try

1845
01:53:54,868 --> 01:53:57,413
to build with Sphinx build.

1846
01:53:59,823 --> 01:54:00,924
So with Sphinx Build, I need

1847
01:54:00,924 --> 01:54:02,306
to pass two arguments.

1848
01:54:02,306 --> 01:54:03,147
The first one is the

1849
01:54:04,188 --> 01:54:06,750
source of the documentation, and

1850
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:09,954
the other is the destination.

1851
01:54:10,775 --> 01:54:14,739
So the build documentation will

1852
01:54:14,739 --> 01:54:18,783
end up in the underscore build directory.

1853
01:54:18,783 --> 01:54:21,807
We'll see, okay, everything has worked.

1854
01:54:21,807 --> 01:54:23,348
So what can I do now?

1855
01:54:23,348 --> 01:54:26,071
I can open, so if I now

1856
01:54:26,071 --> 01:54:29,877
go to build, let's do it with an ls,

1857
01:54:29,877 --> 01:54:32,560
There's many things there, but

1858
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,623
the most important is index.html.

1859
01:54:35,623 --> 01:54:40,188
So if I open that with

1860
01:54:42,631 --> 01:54:44,272
a browser, then I should

1861
01:54:44,272 --> 01:54:48,417
see my HTML documentation.

1862
01:54:48,417 --> 01:54:49,858
So how do I do this?

1863
01:54:49,858 --> 01:54:52,401
On Linux, I use XTG.

1864
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:56,005
That's supposed to work on

1865
01:54:56,005 --> 01:54:59,749
Linux, and then build index.html.

1866
01:55:01,062 --> 01:55:02,744
So this is Linux.

1867
01:55:06,309 --> 01:55:11,396
On Mac OS, you can use just open.

1868
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,562
So if I do just open,

1869
01:55:15,562 --> 01:55:18,165
this works also on Linux, but

1870
01:55:18,165 --> 01:55:22,391
Mac OS, Linux maybe.

1871
01:55:22,391 --> 01:55:23,292
So if you are on

1872
01:55:23,292 --> 01:55:25,375
Windows instead, you should use,

1873
01:55:25,375 --> 01:55:27,077
and you still do this from

1874
01:55:27,077 --> 01:55:30,782
the terminal, you can use start.

1875
01:55:32,028 --> 01:55:34,170
Okay, since I'm on Linux, I

1876
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,573
will go back here and I just

1877
01:55:36,573 --> 01:55:44,141
type xtg and say that this is Linux.

1878
01:55:46,644 --> 01:55:51,529
And somewhere in, so I

1879
01:55:51,529 --> 01:55:54,732
have quite some message here.

1880
01:55:54,732 --> 01:55:55,954
What has happened, and I'll

1881
01:55:55,954 --> 01:56:01,593
show you now, is that in my

1882
01:56:01,593 --> 01:56:06,919
browser, I managed to

1883
01:56:06,919 --> 01:56:10,944
open my documentation, which has,

1884
01:56:10,944 --> 01:56:13,727
so this is the index, which

1885
01:56:13,727 --> 01:56:17,351
is what was generated out of index.rst.

1886
01:56:17,351 --> 01:56:19,373
And then if I click here on the left,

1887
01:56:19,373 --> 01:56:21,335
I have some feature, and

1888
01:56:21,335 --> 01:56:26,101
that's the content of the file

1889
01:56:26,101 --> 01:56:28,023
that I just created.

1890
01:56:28,023 --> 01:56:28,123
Okay.

1891
01:56:29,605 --> 01:56:33,350
And yeah, so if I zoom

1892
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:35,392
in or out, of course, the

1893
01:56:35,392 --> 01:56:36,374
layout is going to change.

1894
01:56:37,956 --> 01:56:38,196
Okay.

1895
01:56:40,278 --> 01:56:41,640
There's also a searching

1896
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:44,604
box generated that's generated automatically.

1897
01:56:45,745 --> 01:56:46,266
Yeah.

1898
01:56:46,266 --> 01:56:48,449
So yeah, searching is a

1899
01:56:48,449 --> 01:56:50,151
very important feature.

1900
01:56:51,112 --> 01:56:55,598
So should I check like I

1901
01:56:55,598 --> 01:56:58,161
want to go back here and say...

1902
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:04,347
Okay, so I guess it, yeah,

1903
01:57:04,347 --> 01:57:05,749
it gives me pages that

1904
01:57:05,749 --> 01:57:08,193
are matching this feature, so it's quite,

1905
01:57:08,193 --> 01:57:10,877
I think the Sphinx feature

1906
01:57:10,877 --> 01:57:16,065
testing is not the best, but

1907
01:57:16,065 --> 01:57:18,248
it's still very useful, very useful.

1908
01:57:20,933 --> 01:57:23,817
Okay, so I will go back

1909
01:57:23,817 --> 01:57:27,993
to, again, to the My Browser, but now showing,

1910
01:57:27,993 --> 01:57:31,717
the exercises that we can work on.

1911
01:57:31,717 --> 01:57:32,799
So we should have like a

1912
01:57:32,799 --> 01:57:34,220
20 minute session, a quite

1913
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:36,363
long exercise section.

1914
01:57:37,264 --> 01:57:41,048
Maybe we should, should we try

1915
01:57:41,048 --> 01:57:42,210
to short it to 15 minutes

1916
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:44,272
just to save some time?

1917
01:57:44,272 --> 01:57:45,514
Do you agree?

1918
01:57:45,514 --> 01:57:46,575
Can you?

1919
01:57:46,575 --> 01:57:50,760
Yeah, maybe 15 minutes is a better choice.

1920
01:57:51,854 --> 01:57:53,877
Yeah, so if you manage to follow along

1921
01:57:53,877 --> 01:57:56,761
so far, you should have now

1922
01:57:56,761 --> 01:57:59,024
a scaffold of a Sphinx project.

1923
01:58:00,606 --> 01:58:02,269
And you should be able

1924
01:58:02,269 --> 01:58:06,094
to add some additional files.

1925
01:58:06,094 --> 01:58:09,138
And in these text files, you

1926
01:58:09,138 --> 01:58:10,520
should be able to try

1927
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:13,064
different features like links,

1928
01:58:13,945 --> 01:58:17,350
tables, numbered lists, code blocks,

1929
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:21,554
and then also try LaTeX.

1930
01:58:21,554 --> 01:58:25,700
So equations.

1931
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:28,865
So this is a chance to

1932
01:58:28,865 --> 01:58:32,170
actually get used to Markdown

1933
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:34,713
and its most important features.

1934
01:58:36,456 --> 01:58:38,299
There's then a third exercise

1935
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:41,183
about Sphinx Autodoc.

1936
01:58:41,183 --> 01:58:42,465
Here you need to create

1937
01:58:42,465 --> 01:58:49,870
an additional example.py file.

1938
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:53,338
that, no, sorry, example Python module,

1939
01:58:53,338 --> 01:58:56,925
which is like, which you will

1940
01:58:56,925 --> 01:58:58,950
store in a file called multiply.py.

1941
01:59:00,273 --> 01:59:03,039
You need to put this stuff,

1942
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:04,722
the idea is that you put

1943
01:59:04,722 --> 01:59:07,669
this content in the file, and

1944
01:59:07,669 --> 01:59:10,174
you see that there is a doc string,

1945
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,524
docstring written actually in

1946
01:59:12,524 --> 01:59:16,856
a structured text and so you can make

1947
01:59:16,856 --> 01:59:21,610
so that your your sphinx

1948
01:59:22,512 --> 01:59:26,506
project actually harvests this

1949
01:59:26,506 --> 01:59:29,229
this code, this doc string

1950
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:34,996
by modifying the configuration in

1951
01:59:34,996 --> 01:59:36,258
the way that's written here.

1952
01:59:37,139 --> 01:59:39,462
And also you need to modify

1953
01:59:39,462 --> 01:59:40,723
your index and then you

1954
01:59:40,723 --> 01:59:41,865
can rebuild the documentation.

1955
01:59:41,865 --> 01:59:45,369
You should see an additional

1956
01:59:45,369 --> 01:59:49,274
page with the API reference for

1957
01:59:49,274 --> 01:59:52,918
this very small and simple module.

1958
01:59:54,333 --> 01:59:57,357
So we'll put links of

1959
01:59:57,357 --> 02:00:00,520
to the possibility already there.

1960
02:00:01,682 --> 02:00:01,802
Okay.

1961
02:00:01,802 --> 02:00:03,944
So we have this exercise section.

1962
02:00:03,944 --> 02:00:07,989
Yeah, a bit upper to the latex block.

1963
02:00:07,989 --> 02:00:09,451
Yeah, yeah.

1964
02:00:09,451 --> 02:00:12,514
I think the configuration extensions.

1965
02:00:13,656 --> 02:00:15,758
Yeah, here for different

1966
02:00:15,758 --> 02:00:18,481
versions of Sphinx, it might

1967
02:00:18,481 --> 02:00:21,080
be a bit different for older

1968
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,782
Sphinx version, you may

1969
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:27,247
need this Sphinx.ext.massjax.

1970
02:00:27,247 --> 02:00:29,169
For the new version, maybe this

1971
02:00:29,169 --> 02:00:32,472
is not very necessary, but it doesn't hurt.

1972
02:00:32,472 --> 02:00:33,873
Yeah.

1973
02:00:33,873 --> 02:00:34,154
Yeah.

1974
02:00:34,154 --> 02:00:35,435
So you can try without

1975
02:00:35,435 --> 02:00:38,258
changing the configuration or as you wish.

1976
02:00:38,258 --> 02:00:39,219
But yeah, this shouldn't be

1977
02:00:39,219 --> 02:00:41,421
needed if you have a very recent.

1978
02:00:41,421 --> 02:00:42,463
So if you are using a

1979
02:00:42,463 --> 02:00:43,744
very recent version of Sphinx,

1980
02:00:43,744 --> 02:00:45,846
it doesn't, it shouldn't work,

1981
02:00:45,846 --> 02:00:47,388
shouldn't be needed.

1982
02:00:47,388 --> 02:00:49,210
So I let you,

1983
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:51,012
go to the exercises and

1984
02:00:51,012 --> 02:00:54,916
we should reconvene in 15 minutes.

1985
02:00:55,978 --> 02:00:58,600
So I will switch to the notes perhaps.

1986
02:01:03,666 --> 02:01:04,887
Yeah, the notes are here.

1987
02:01:06,589 --> 02:01:08,692
Okay, so see you in 15 minutes.

1988
02:01:09,793 --> 02:01:10,273
And have fun.

1989
02:01:11,495 --> 02:01:11,935
Bye.

1990
02:01:11,935 --> 02:01:12,636
Bye bye.

1991
02:15:27,267 --> 02:15:27,768
Welcome back.

1992
02:15:28,869 --> 02:15:31,172
I hope you had an interesting,

1993
02:15:31,172 --> 02:15:35,317
you find the exercises on Sphinx interesting.

1994
02:15:38,761 --> 02:15:40,864
We will head into a break soon,

1995
02:15:40,864 --> 02:15:44,348
but first we would like to

1996
02:15:44,348 --> 02:15:47,051
discuss a little points about

1997
02:15:47,051 --> 02:15:49,955
Sphinx, more about this, and

1998
02:15:51,176 --> 02:15:52,538
then give a glimpse of what

1999
02:15:52,538 --> 02:15:54,280
is going to happen after the break.

2000
02:15:55,902 --> 02:15:57,018
So,

2001
02:15:57,018 --> 02:16:00,645
One thing, so if you're

2002
02:16:00,645 --> 02:16:02,529
confused about restructured text Markdown

2003
02:16:02,529 --> 02:16:06,316
and MyST, so the idea

2004
02:16:06,316 --> 02:16:07,639
is that restructured text is

2005
02:16:07,639 --> 02:16:11,968
the oldest format and Sphinx was built for it.

2006
02:16:11,968 --> 02:16:12,695
Okay.

2007
02:16:12,695 --> 02:16:14,539
Then Markdown was independently

2008
02:16:14,539 --> 02:16:17,785
developed because someone wanted

2009
02:16:17,785 --> 02:16:18,486
something simpler.

2010
02:16:19,509 --> 02:16:21,973
And so Markdown became more

2011
02:16:21,973 --> 02:16:22,975
and more popular because of

2012
02:16:24,559 --> 02:16:26,843
its simplicity, but it was

2013
02:16:26,843 --> 02:16:29,249
limited compared to restructured text.

2014
02:16:29,249 --> 02:16:31,553
and then my st was created

2015
02:16:31,553 --> 02:16:34,619
as a flavor markdown that would

2016
02:16:34,619 --> 02:16:37,484
sort of uh unify the two things

2017
02:16:37,484 --> 02:16:40,490
at least in the in the sphinx uh for

2018
02:16:40,490 --> 02:16:42,153
for the for for the sphinx

2019
02:16:42,153 --> 02:16:46,581
tunings okay uh regarding um

2020
02:16:48,023 --> 02:16:51,730
good practices i would say um so the

2021
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:54,725
The build directory, which is the one

2022
02:16:54,725 --> 02:16:57,833
where we store our documentation, well,

2023
02:16:57,833 --> 02:16:59,437
that one should not be

2024
02:16:59,437 --> 02:17:00,921
under version control, so you

2025
02:17:00,921 --> 02:17:04,130
should not git add that directory.

2026
02:17:04,130 --> 02:17:06,555
So you can still have it

2027
02:17:06,555 --> 02:17:09,640
in the directory, but it shouldn't

2028
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:10,662
be in the repository.

2029
02:17:11,464 --> 02:17:14,309
It shouldn't be added to the repository.

2030
02:17:14,309 --> 02:17:15,752
So we recommend you add

2031
02:17:16,934 --> 02:17:19,699
this directory to your gitignore

2032
02:17:19,699 --> 02:17:21,162
so you don't accidentally add

2033
02:17:22,505 --> 02:17:26,492
these files to your repository.

2034
02:17:28,548 --> 02:17:31,512
There are also some tools that

2035
02:17:31,512 --> 02:17:34,877
allow you to automatically refresh

2036
02:17:34,877 --> 02:17:36,660
the view every time you make a change.

2037
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:38,442
So there's Sphinx AutoBuild.

2038
02:17:38,442 --> 02:17:40,966
And also, if you have

2039
02:17:40,966 --> 02:17:44,871
links in your documentation, you

2040
02:17:44,871 --> 02:17:46,153
want them to be checked

2041
02:17:46,153 --> 02:17:48,216
automatically to make sure that

2042
02:17:48,216 --> 02:17:49,398
they actually point at something,

2043
02:17:50,339 --> 02:17:54,029
there is this minus icon.

2044
02:17:54,029 --> 02:17:56,172
There is this link check

2045
02:17:57,354 --> 02:18:00,579
utility that is pretty useful

2046
02:18:00,579 --> 02:18:02,262
and pretty time-saving.

2047
02:18:04,806 --> 02:18:07,710
So what are we going to do after the break?

2048
02:18:08,692 --> 02:18:13,600
After the break, we have

2049
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:16,564
all the stuff locally tested.

2050
02:18:16,564 --> 02:18:18,748
After break, we can try to

2051
02:18:18,748 --> 02:18:21,572
deploy it on the internet.

2052
02:18:23,982 --> 02:18:25,384
then you can share it.

2053
02:18:25,384 --> 02:18:26,025
Using GitHub?

2054
02:18:26,025 --> 02:18:26,847
Yes.

2055
02:18:26,847 --> 02:18:30,012
We will use GitHub as a demo.

2056
02:18:31,614 --> 02:18:32,596
Yeah.

2057
02:18:32,596 --> 02:18:36,722
And so we will have a page on github.io.

2058
02:18:36,722 --> 02:18:37,083
Yes.

2059
02:18:37,083 --> 02:18:37,644
Right?

2060
02:18:37,644 --> 02:18:40,108
And this one.

2061
02:18:40,108 --> 02:18:40,929
Okay.

2062
02:18:40,929 --> 02:18:42,275
So...

2063
02:18:42,275 --> 02:18:43,637
Shall we just head into a

2064
02:18:43,637 --> 02:18:45,680
break, into a 10-minute break

2065
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:47,082
for the same reasons I

2066
02:18:47,082 --> 02:18:49,445
mentioned before, like cardiovascular

2067
02:18:49,445 --> 02:18:53,291
health and attention.

2068
02:18:54,593 --> 02:18:58,238
So I'll switch maybe to the notes.

2069
02:19:01,663 --> 02:19:02,524
Wait, the notes.

2070
02:19:04,046 --> 02:19:06,289
Go to the bottom and yeah.

2071
02:19:06,289 --> 02:19:08,392
So see you in 10 minutes then.

2072
02:19:09,594 --> 02:19:09,774
Yes.

2073
02:19:11,116 --> 02:19:11,337
Bye-bye.

2074
02:19:11,337 --> 02:19:11,657
Bye-bye.

2075
02:29:28,975 --> 02:29:30,157
Hello, we're back.

2076
02:29:31,038 --> 02:29:34,002
And the next topic is

2077
02:29:34,002 --> 02:29:36,646
deploying Sphinx documentation to

2078
02:29:36,646 --> 02:29:37,567
GitHub pages.

2079
02:29:38,689 --> 02:29:40,732
We have everything tested locally.

2080
02:29:41,713 --> 02:29:43,476
Now it's time to share it

2081
02:29:43,476 --> 02:29:46,930
with people then by serving it

2082
02:29:46,930 --> 02:29:48,913
on a website.

2083
02:29:50,395 --> 02:29:54,121
GitHub is a convenient way to do this.

2084
02:29:54,121 --> 02:29:55,443
You have the other options

2085
02:29:55,443 --> 02:29:59,709
like GitLab or the other like Bitbucket.

2086
02:30:01,011 --> 02:30:03,395
We will use GitHub here.

2087
02:30:03,395 --> 02:30:05,718
So two services we're going

2088
02:30:05,718 --> 02:30:08,582
to use to realize this.

2089
02:30:08,582 --> 02:30:10,185
First one is GitHub Pages.

2090
02:30:10,185 --> 02:30:12,589
GitHub Pages serve websites

2091
02:30:12,589 --> 02:30:14,271
from your GitHub repo.

2092
02:30:15,145 --> 02:30:18,588
And the GitHub actions will also be used.

2093
02:30:18,588 --> 02:30:21,431
It automatically runs code when

2094
02:30:21,431 --> 02:30:24,173
you push something or some people

2095
02:30:24,173 --> 02:30:25,695
send a pull request.

2096
02:30:25,695 --> 02:30:28,498
You can configure it to do this.

2097
02:30:28,498 --> 02:30:30,599
We will see it later.

2098
02:30:30,599 --> 02:30:35,404
So basically, so in real

2099
02:30:35,404 --> 02:30:37,366
world, you may need to push

2100
02:30:38,227 --> 02:30:43,394
the stuff local to the remote repo in GitHub

2101
02:30:43,394 --> 02:30:46,518
But here we will use a template for this.

2102
02:30:50,444 --> 02:30:51,626
Yes.

2103
02:30:54,069 --> 02:30:56,733
So you can see, okay, I

2104
02:30:56,733 --> 02:30:58,515
will keep this a little bit

2105
02:30:58,515 --> 02:31:01,299
slower such that you can code along.

2106
02:31:02,922 --> 02:31:04,584
Maybe I should go back again.

2107
02:31:04,584 --> 02:31:06,347
So this is the link

2108
02:31:06,347 --> 02:31:10,212
I clicked, the documentation example.

2109
02:31:11,457 --> 02:31:14,562
And you can see here is

2110
02:31:14,562 --> 02:31:16,906
a template from Code Refinery.

2111
02:31:16,906 --> 02:31:19,610
We'll use that and make a

2112
02:31:19,610 --> 02:31:22,134
copy to our own repo.

2113
02:31:22,134 --> 02:31:23,756
I will give it a name

2114
02:31:23,756 --> 02:31:28,664
like maybe docs example.

2115
02:31:28,664 --> 02:31:29,866
Okay, that's available.

2116
02:31:31,408 --> 02:31:33,412
Yes, create the repository.

2117
02:31:35,875 --> 02:31:37,498
It will take a few seconds.

2118
02:31:40,972 --> 02:31:43,655
Okay, so here is the content.

2119
02:31:44,676 --> 02:31:47,058
We can see there's a source folder.

2120
02:31:47,058 --> 02:31:50,121
Here you're supposed to have

2121
02:31:50,121 --> 02:31:52,003
your source code for your

2122
02:31:52,003 --> 02:31:54,245
project, for example, Python code

2123
02:31:54,245 --> 02:31:56,567
or some other language.

2124
02:31:56,567 --> 02:31:58,329
And the doc folder is

2125
02:31:58,329 --> 02:32:01,772
where the documentation is.

2126
02:32:01,772 --> 02:32:03,053
You can see these files

2127
02:32:03,053 --> 02:32:06,677
are exactly the same as showed

2128
02:32:06,677 --> 02:32:09,473
by Michaela in the demo.

2129
02:32:09,473 --> 02:32:11,195
the index file under

2130
02:32:11,195 --> 02:32:12,718
the configuration file.

2131
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:18,566
So this is a typical file structure.

2132
02:32:19,928 --> 02:32:21,049
You can see that there is

2133
02:32:21,049 --> 02:32:23,573
a shorter readme file here.

2134
02:32:23,573 --> 02:32:26,056
But in order to let GitHub

2135
02:32:27,078 --> 02:32:30,302
pages to host this thing, we

2136
02:32:30,302 --> 02:32:33,366
needed to create a configuration file

2137
02:32:33,366 --> 02:32:34,468
for it to use.

2138
02:32:35,478 --> 02:32:37,921
I will create a file.

2139
02:32:37,921 --> 02:32:40,184
So create a new file.

2140
02:32:42,347 --> 02:32:43,328
We will give it a name.

2141
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:49,155
The path for the file should be GitHub.

2142
02:32:49,155 --> 02:32:51,959
I will type a slash.

2143
02:32:51,959 --> 02:32:53,241
Then it will go to the

2144
02:32:53,241 --> 02:32:58,287
next level, which is workflows.

2145
02:32:59,929 --> 02:33:02,172
This name should be fixed.

2146
02:33:02,172 --> 02:33:05,077
It's the standard of GitHub.

2147
02:33:05,077 --> 02:33:06,599
Then the file name, the file

2148
02:33:06,599 --> 02:33:09,964
name could be something you like yourself.

2149
02:33:12,307 --> 02:33:14,911
Documentation, I will use this

2150
02:33:14,911 --> 02:33:21,560
and the extension should be YAML or YML.

2151
02:33:23,443 --> 02:33:25,085
So that's the file.

2152
02:33:25,085 --> 02:33:28,129
I will copy the content from our material.

2153
02:33:29,611 --> 02:33:30,713
So this is the

2154
02:33:31,992 --> 02:33:34,956
A configuration file used by GitHub pages.

2155
02:33:34,956 --> 02:33:38,620
There's a name, documentation,

2156
02:33:39,622 --> 02:33:45,349
and this line is telling

2157
02:33:45,349 --> 02:33:47,532
GitHub actions to do the

2158
02:33:47,532 --> 02:33:50,776
automatic update when people are

2159
02:33:50,776 --> 02:33:52,979
pushing or sending pull requests.

2160
02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:56,203
Workflow dispatch means you

2161
02:33:56,203 --> 02:34:01,830
can manually run the workflow.

2162
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:04,562
and then we give it

2163
02:34:04,562 --> 02:34:06,525
a write permission because we

2164
02:34:06,525 --> 02:34:09,390
needed to have all Git pages

2165
02:34:09,390 --> 02:34:13,196
to write something to the build folder.

2166
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:17,544
We can see something.

2167
02:34:17,544 --> 02:34:19,126
Yeah, if you're not very

2168
02:34:19,126 --> 02:34:23,273
familiar with Git actions, don't worry.

2169
02:34:23,273 --> 02:34:26,278
Well, I usually don't write

2170
02:34:26,278 --> 02:34:27,220
this thing myself.

2171
02:34:27,220 --> 02:34:29,303
I just copy it from somewhere.

2172
02:34:30,312 --> 02:34:32,715
Yeah, and then amend it

2173
02:34:32,715 --> 02:34:34,177
and change something.

2174
02:34:34,177 --> 02:34:36,159
Yeah, and make some changes.

2175
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:39,043
So it runs on the Ubuntu

2176
02:34:39,043 --> 02:34:42,006
server provided by GitHub.

2177
02:34:42,006 --> 02:34:43,749
It's a virtual machine, I think.

2178
02:34:43,749 --> 02:34:46,071
And there are some actions.

2179
02:34:46,071 --> 02:34:52,739
Actions are some programs people

2180
02:34:52,739 --> 02:34:55,423
and we reuse it here.

2181
02:34:55,423 --> 02:35:00,591
And then there's some other

2182
02:35:00,591 --> 02:35:05,578
commands we write here and we specify here.

2183
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:09,904
Firstly is install dependencies.

2184
02:35:09,904 --> 02:35:10,846
In our case, we need

2185
02:35:10,846 --> 02:35:14,852
to install Sphinx under Mr.

2186
02:35:14,852 --> 02:35:16,334
Passer and something else.

2187
02:35:17,175 --> 02:35:22,574
And then the next step is Sphinx build.

2188
02:35:22,574 --> 02:35:23,855
the commander you saw,

2189
02:35:24,796 --> 02:35:25,797
what Michaela showed.

2190
02:35:26,978 --> 02:35:30,402
In that case, it's from the present folder.

2191
02:35:30,402 --> 02:35:31,843
So it's a dot here.

2192
02:35:32,844 --> 02:35:34,286
But in this case, the file

2193
02:35:34,286 --> 02:35:36,308
system is a little bit different.

2194
02:35:36,308 --> 02:35:39,471
The contents for the documentation

2195
02:35:39,471 --> 02:35:41,993
are in the doc folder.

2196
02:35:41,993 --> 02:35:42,934
So it's from doc.

2197
02:35:42,934 --> 02:35:47,058
And the HTM files will be

2198
02:35:47,058 --> 02:35:51,869
created in the build folder as before.

2199
02:35:51,869 --> 02:35:53,591
And then the last step is

2200
02:35:53,591 --> 02:35:55,713
deployed to a GitHub page.

2201
02:35:56,554 --> 02:35:58,316
We're still reusing something

2202
02:35:59,357 --> 02:36:00,818
written by the other people.

2203
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:03,421
Yeah.

2204
02:36:03,421 --> 02:36:08,526
And here are some arguments

2205
02:36:10,088 --> 02:36:12,030
for Git action to use.

2206
02:36:13,191 --> 02:36:15,634
So the first thing is

2207
02:36:15,634 --> 02:36:20,168
from which branch you're going to deploy the

2208
02:36:20,168 --> 02:36:22,311
GitHub page, in this case,

2209
02:36:22,311 --> 02:36:26,996
or by default, it's a th page.

2210
02:36:26,996 --> 02:36:29,299
And the GitHub token is

2211
02:36:29,299 --> 02:36:31,462
something generated by GitHub, I think.

2212
02:36:32,443 --> 02:36:33,985
And this is the folder

2213
02:36:33,985 --> 02:36:37,909
from where the static files should be.

2214
02:36:39,091 --> 02:36:43,476
And this force often means

2215
02:36:44,384 --> 02:36:48,409
Yeah, means that this branch

2216
02:36:48,409 --> 02:36:51,813
will be created without a parent.

2217
02:36:53,675 --> 02:36:55,277
So I will copy this stuff

2218
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:02,266
and go back to here and paste it here.

2219
02:37:04,588 --> 02:37:05,790
I think I don't need

2220
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:07,652
to modify anything here.

2221
02:37:07,652 --> 02:37:09,975
I will just make the changes.

2222
02:37:11,056 --> 02:37:12,778
So I will commit it directly

2223
02:37:12,778 --> 02:37:14,340
to the main branch.

2224
02:37:17,257 --> 02:37:20,340
So git actions will follow

2225
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:23,464
the instructions in the configuration file.

2226
02:37:25,526 --> 02:37:26,568
Let's go back.

2227
02:37:29,090 --> 02:37:31,013
But there are some other things

2228
02:37:31,013 --> 02:37:34,917
we need to set up, which

2229
02:37:34,917 --> 02:37:39,062
is from which branch git

2230
02:37:39,062 --> 02:37:41,540
actions should deploy the

2231
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:45,225
the web page as we have

2232
02:37:46,046 --> 02:37:48,088
seen in the configuration file

2233
02:37:48,088 --> 02:37:51,633
that the branch should be the

2234
02:37:51,633 --> 02:37:54,156
GH pages from the root of

2235
02:37:54,156 --> 02:37:57,740
this branch to deploy the web page.

2236
02:37:58,622 --> 02:37:59,863
So I will save this.

2237
02:37:59,863 --> 02:38:02,987
Okay.

2238
02:38:04,108 --> 02:38:05,370
Now let's go back

2239
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:12,624
We can see there's already some actions.

2240
02:38:12,624 --> 02:38:14,906
If I click actions, we

2241
02:38:14,906 --> 02:38:20,992
can see there's already action finished.

2242
02:38:20,992 --> 02:38:29,239
And another one is why it's waiting.

2243
02:38:29,239 --> 02:38:31,542
But sometimes I guess, okay,

2244
02:38:31,542 --> 02:38:32,162
it seems to this.

2245
02:38:32,162 --> 02:38:33,043
Okay.

2246
02:38:33,043 --> 02:38:37,467
Refresh the under, it's done now.

2247
02:38:44,652 --> 02:38:48,056
Okay, we should have a link

2248
02:38:48,056 --> 02:38:50,399
to the webpage here, but we need

2249
02:38:50,399 --> 02:38:52,541
to set up this a bit.

2250
02:38:54,063 --> 02:38:56,165
Yeah, you can tap it here,

2251
02:38:56,165 --> 02:38:57,387
but it can also be

2252
02:38:57,387 --> 02:39:00,551
automatically filled by clicking this.

2253
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,673
I'll save the changes.

2254
02:39:05,536 --> 02:39:07,539
So then this is the link,

2255
02:39:07,539 --> 02:39:14,183
the URL to the webpage, which is your GitHub

2256
02:39:14,183 --> 02:39:16,807
name and then the project name.

2257
02:39:16,807 --> 02:39:18,088
Let's check this out.

2258
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:20,432
Yeah, so this is the

2259
02:39:20,432 --> 02:39:22,334
content of the documentation.

2260
02:39:24,057 --> 02:39:26,220
Very similar as the local one.

2261
02:39:29,544 --> 02:39:29,645
Okay.

2262
02:39:32,368 --> 02:39:34,191
I think we can make a

2263
02:39:34,191 --> 02:39:36,975
little bit change to the to the

2264
02:39:36,975 --> 02:39:39,118
file to see to the markdown

2265
02:39:39,118 --> 02:39:42,482
file to see if anything changed

2266
02:39:42,482 --> 02:39:43,684
from the web page.

2267
02:39:44,525 --> 02:39:48,471
I will simply add more atoms.

2268
02:39:56,923 --> 02:39:58,605
I will commit the changes.

2269
02:40:01,669 --> 02:40:06,757
This should trigger another Git action.

2270
02:40:06,757 --> 02:40:08,860
Yes, we can have a look

2271
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:10,482
at what's going on here actually.

2272
02:40:14,714 --> 02:40:17,277
So the workflow here is

2273
02:40:17,277 --> 02:40:21,062
running all the steps in the job.

2274
02:40:21,883 --> 02:40:22,123
Yes.

2275
02:40:23,204 --> 02:40:27,089
And it did already the, I

2276
02:40:27,089 --> 02:40:28,651
think it did already everything.

2277
02:40:29,652 --> 02:40:31,034
Yeah.

2278
02:40:31,034 --> 02:40:32,536
It's been quite quick.

2279
02:40:32,536 --> 02:40:33,557
It's not always so quick.

2280
02:40:33,557 --> 02:40:34,398
It's very quick.

2281
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:42,308
But it may take a few seconds to, I should

2282
02:40:43,604 --> 02:40:45,827
Yeah, but it will take a few.

2283
02:40:45,827 --> 02:40:46,528
Oh, okay.

2284
02:40:46,528 --> 02:40:48,210
That's also very quick.

2285
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:49,752
So we can see item four

2286
02:40:49,752 --> 02:40:51,354
and item five added here.

2287
02:40:53,717 --> 02:40:55,560
Yeah, it can take up to a minute or so.

2288
02:40:56,561 --> 02:40:58,964
Yeah, sometimes it's slower.

2289
02:41:00,626 --> 02:41:02,409
Yeah, that's basically a

2290
02:41:02,409 --> 02:41:05,192
simple workflow for the deployment

2291
02:41:05,192 --> 02:41:06,314
by using GitHub.

2292
02:41:11,541 --> 02:41:12,582
Let's see.

2293
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:14,961
Yeah, that's steps here.

2294
02:41:18,125 --> 02:41:20,047
Okay, so we're done with this.

2295
02:41:21,929 --> 02:41:23,291
If there's any questions, I think

2296
02:41:23,291 --> 02:41:24,652
that someone is trying to

2297
02:41:24,652 --> 02:41:29,659
follow along and they are struggling a little.

2298
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:35,586
We did, I think, I think

2299
02:41:35,586 --> 02:41:39,210
that the part to the configuration of the

2300
02:41:40,068 --> 02:41:41,269
of the action.

2301
02:41:41,269 --> 02:41:45,854
I think we described quite well.

2302
02:41:45,854 --> 02:41:47,336
I don't know if there's

2303
02:41:47,336 --> 02:41:50,319
anything we should look again, but

2304
02:41:50,319 --> 02:41:54,204
maybe we can do it later.

2305
02:41:55,445 --> 02:41:58,989
Yeah, I think we can use

2306
02:41:58,989 --> 02:42:03,274
the extra minutes to recap these things.

2307
02:42:07,523 --> 02:42:12,030
Should we wrap up stuff today?

2308
02:42:13,653 --> 02:42:15,996
And maybe use some time after

2309
02:42:15,996 --> 02:42:19,983
that to, if someone want to

2310
02:42:19,983 --> 02:42:21,405
stay, we can use that time

2311
02:42:21,405 --> 02:42:25,752
to recap something or do something else.

2312
02:42:29,039 --> 02:42:31,081
Yeah, I think I want just to stress

2313
02:42:31,081 --> 02:42:36,105
how this GitHub Actions is

2314
02:42:36,105 --> 02:42:38,427
a very interesting tool because

2315
02:42:38,427 --> 02:42:41,910
it allows you to really automate

2316
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:43,992
a lot of tasks around

2317
02:42:46,695 --> 02:42:47,956
software development on GitHub.

2318
02:42:49,077 --> 02:42:51,119
Here we have been using

2319
02:42:51,119 --> 02:42:57,224
it for building your documentation

2320
02:42:57,224 --> 02:42:58,874
and then deploying it.

2321
02:42:58,874 --> 02:43:01,337
But, um, but you can do

2322
02:43:01,337 --> 02:43:03,320
much more, many more things

2323
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:05,523
like, you know, running test use and so on.

2324
02:43:05,523 --> 02:43:06,083
And it's cool.

2325
02:43:06,083 --> 02:43:11,991
Also the fact that you can reuse as,

2326
02:43:11,991 --> 02:43:14,634
as, uh, the, um, uh,

2327
02:43:14,634 --> 02:43:17,458
like actions that other people have written.

2328
02:43:18,519 --> 02:43:22,044
Uh, so, uh, yeah, it's,

2329
02:43:22,044 --> 02:43:23,586
uh, the composability is nice.

2330
02:43:23,586 --> 02:43:28,392
I would say, um,

2331
02:43:30,413 --> 02:43:31,976
Yeah.

2332
02:43:31,976 --> 02:43:34,620
So what could we talk a bit about?

2333
02:43:34,620 --> 02:43:38,426
So this lesson has actually

2334
02:43:38,426 --> 02:43:40,429
other things we could talk about,

2335
02:43:40,429 --> 02:43:42,312
but I think we should give

2336
02:43:42,312 --> 02:43:45,758
a bit of time for feedback

2337
02:43:45,758 --> 02:43:49,043
and to introduce also what's

2338
02:43:49,043 --> 02:43:50,405
going to happen next week.

2339
02:43:52,008 --> 02:43:53,448
But yeah.

2340
02:43:53,448 --> 02:43:55,450
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's going

2341
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:57,192
a bit too faster.

2342
02:43:59,074 --> 02:44:00,795
But you can also join

2343
02:44:00,795 --> 02:44:03,959
the help sessions later and then

2344
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:07,502
we can maybe redo something.

2345
02:44:13,268 --> 02:44:13,708
All right.

2346
02:44:15,150 --> 02:44:18,493
Thank you, [name] and [name] for today.

2347
02:44:19,368 --> 02:44:21,070
If there was one thing that

2348
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:22,131
you would like people to

2349
02:44:22,131 --> 02:44:24,194
take from today's lesson, what would it be?

2350
02:44:25,215 --> 02:44:28,259
What would you like people to take home?

2351
02:44:32,223 --> 02:44:35,327
Well, I mean, we covered a lot of things.

2352
02:44:36,228 --> 02:44:38,751
So I hope that, I hope

2353
02:44:38,751 --> 02:44:41,454
possibly, can I choose two?

2354
02:44:41,454 --> 02:44:42,696
Can I choose two things?

2355
02:44:42,696 --> 02:44:43,857
Yes, you can choose two.

2356
02:44:45,187 --> 02:44:49,351
One is, I think, just how

2357
02:44:49,351 --> 02:44:54,677
to start using Sphinx, because

2358
02:44:54,677 --> 02:44:58,120
this is actually, I think,

2359
02:44:58,120 --> 02:44:59,822
very similar to other tools.

2360
02:44:59,822 --> 02:45:00,703
And if you learn a bit

2361
02:45:00,703 --> 02:45:02,264
the workflow here, I think you

2362
02:45:02,264 --> 02:45:06,509
will be fine also with other tools.

2363
02:45:06,509 --> 02:45:08,210
And also, I think, in

2364
02:45:08,210 --> 02:45:11,140
general, about readme files,

2365
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:13,022
that know that you can do more,

2366
02:45:13,022 --> 02:45:16,025
that there are options to

2367
02:45:16,025 --> 02:45:20,750
organize your documentation with

2368
02:45:20,750 --> 02:45:23,112
the README files, with links,

2369
02:45:23,112 --> 02:45:25,535
with all the features that

2370
02:45:25,535 --> 02:45:27,697
Markdown itself only gives you,

2371
02:45:28,658 --> 02:45:30,259
just alone gives you for

2372
02:45:30,259 --> 02:45:32,622
just making your README easier to use.

2373
02:45:35,224 --> 02:45:35,465
Right.

2374
02:45:36,386 --> 02:45:38,588
And the materials, if you

2375
02:45:38,588 --> 02:45:40,958
go through the links that we shared in the

2376
02:45:40,958 --> 02:45:43,723
collaborative notes include like

2377
02:45:43,723 --> 02:45:46,087
a walkthrough of everything that

2378
02:45:46,087 --> 02:45:48,391
both [name] and you went through today.

2379
02:45:48,391 --> 02:45:50,915
So if you think it went

2380
02:45:50,915 --> 02:45:53,720
too fast, then sorry for that.

2381
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:54,842
But know that you can always

2382
02:45:54,842 --> 02:45:58,002
go back to the material and follow step by step

2383
02:45:58,002 --> 02:45:58,463
there.

2384
02:45:58,463 --> 02:46:05,093
And let me just check where I added it.

2385
02:46:05,093 --> 02:46:05,434
I didn't.

2386
02:46:06,796 --> 02:46:11,844
Okay, I also have one quick news section.

2387
02:46:12,985 --> 02:46:14,768
I'll add that to the end of the document.

2388
02:46:18,474 --> 02:46:21,779
So also know that the code refinery

2389
02:46:21,779 --> 02:46:23,361
people, the Code Refinery

2390
02:46:23,361 --> 02:46:26,765
community, we actually have a Zulip chat

2391
02:46:26,765 --> 02:46:28,147
where we're hanging out and

2392
02:46:28,147 --> 02:46:30,109
where you can also, where you're

2393
02:46:30,109 --> 02:46:32,151
very free to join us.

2394
02:46:32,151 --> 02:46:33,273
And you can still ask

2395
02:46:33,273 --> 02:46:36,737
questions in that chat also about the workshop.

2396
02:46:36,737 --> 02:46:39,400
The link is now in that blue box.

2397
02:46:40,982 --> 02:46:43,244
So if you want to like

2398
02:46:43,244 --> 02:46:44,365
go through the exercises

2399
02:46:44,365 --> 02:46:45,927
yourselves afterward and there's

2400
02:46:45,927 --> 02:46:47,169
something coming up.

2401
02:46:47,169 --> 02:46:48,190
Know that you can join there

2402
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:50,773
or also during the next session next Wednesday.

2403
02:46:50,773 --> 02:46:52,835
Feel free to bring a

2404
02:46:52,835 --> 02:46:53,956
question from this session.

2405
02:46:53,956 --> 02:46:54,757
Like it does not have

2406
02:46:54,757 --> 02:46:57,861
to be necessarily about next week's session.

2407
02:46:59,303 --> 02:47:01,345
And yeah, thank you so

2408
02:47:01,345 --> 02:47:02,386
much everyone for today.

2409
02:47:02,386 --> 02:47:04,108
Thank you to our great

2410
02:47:04,108 --> 02:47:07,011
instructors for guiding us through the lesson.

2411
02:47:07,011 --> 02:47:08,854
Really hope that you took

2412
02:47:08,854 --> 02:47:10,818
something away from it.

2413
02:47:10,818 --> 02:47:13,181
And especially something that you

2414
02:47:13,181 --> 02:47:16,346
can also take into your own

2415
02:47:16,346 --> 02:47:19,190
daily work as a researcher who codes.

2416
02:47:20,071 --> 02:47:21,233
And next week, we'll look

2417
02:47:21,233 --> 02:47:23,676
into Jupyter notebooks.

2418
02:47:23,676 --> 02:47:26,581
So we'll have same time, same place,

2419
02:47:26,581 --> 02:47:29,405
a session about Jupyter notebooks,

2420
02:47:29,405 --> 02:47:30,707
which in some sense is also

2421
02:47:30,707 --> 02:47:32,830
a way of documentation or

2422
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:36,468
can be or visualization and

2423
02:47:36,468 --> 02:47:38,570
I know many of you probably say that,

2424
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:39,671
oh, but Jupyter Notebooks, I

2425
02:47:39,671 --> 02:47:41,774
know that, I've used that in some course.

2426
02:47:41,774 --> 02:47:43,275
Even if you think that,

2427
02:47:44,176 --> 02:47:45,197
I think there's still something

2428
02:47:45,197 --> 02:47:48,501
new also part of the session,

2429
02:47:48,501 --> 02:47:52,545
so I would still recommend to join and find out.

2430
02:47:55,028 --> 02:47:57,170
We have also added, and it

2431
02:47:57,170 --> 02:47:58,792
is visible on the stream, yes,

2432
02:48:00,033 --> 02:48:01,074
in the very bottom of the

2433
02:48:01,074 --> 02:48:03,437
document, a feedback for today

2434
02:48:04,497 --> 02:48:06,999
So we know now already that

2435
02:48:06,999 --> 02:48:09,642
some of you found it a bit too fast.

2436
02:48:13,225 --> 02:48:14,606
That is also good to let

2437
02:48:14,606 --> 02:48:17,009
us know here so that we have it documented.

2438
02:48:18,750 --> 02:48:20,452
And then also share a bit

2439
02:48:20,452 --> 02:48:22,774
like one thing that was good about today,

2440
02:48:22,774 --> 02:48:24,396
one thing you liked about

2441
02:48:24,396 --> 02:48:26,598
today's session and one thing

2442
02:48:26,598 --> 02:48:29,440
that we should make sure to

2443
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:31,762
improve for next time.

2444
02:48:33,124 --> 02:48:33,657
So

2445
02:48:33,657 --> 02:48:34,738
And if you have any other

2446
02:48:34,738 --> 02:48:36,080
feedback and you can also

2447
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:39,984
still add questions here.

2448
02:48:39,984 --> 02:48:40,665
So we will leave the

2449
02:48:40,665 --> 02:48:42,767
document open still for a while today

2450
02:48:42,767 --> 02:48:45,250
and try to answer the

2451
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:48,574
questions and then the document

2452
02:48:48,574 --> 02:48:52,658
will be archived on our event page.

2453
02:48:55,401 --> 02:48:58,304
And yes, we see that there is too fast,

2454
02:48:58,304 --> 02:48:59,686
but it, yeah, it is a lot

2455
02:48:59,686 --> 02:49:02,142
of things in a short time.

2456
02:49:02,142 --> 02:49:04,605
If you feel like that you

2457
02:49:04,605 --> 02:49:05,606
would rather have a longer

2458
02:49:05,606 --> 02:49:07,709
session, that's also something to let us know.

2459
02:49:07,709 --> 02:49:09,451
We are always trying to

2460
02:49:09,451 --> 02:49:10,573
develop these workshops.

2461
02:49:11,694 --> 02:49:13,156
And we try to find a

2462
02:49:13,156 --> 02:49:15,539
good balance between the amount of stuff

2463
02:49:15,539 --> 02:49:17,601
that we want to show you,

2464
02:49:17,601 --> 02:49:20,926
the amount of cool stuff, of

2465
02:49:20,926 --> 02:49:23,809
stuff that we really like, and

2466
02:49:25,051 --> 02:49:30,205
then also to not keep you here for too long.

2467
02:49:30,205 --> 02:49:31,367
Because we also know that

2468
02:49:31,367 --> 02:49:35,456
there is this Zoom fatigue going on.

2469
02:49:35,456 --> 02:49:37,520
And the longer a course is,

2470
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,542
like you always have, then

2471
02:49:38,542 --> 02:49:39,464
some people are dropping up.

2472
02:49:39,464 --> 02:49:40,927
But do let us know if you feel like

2473
02:49:40,927 --> 02:49:42,150
that you would like longer

2474
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:43,853
sessions on this and we can consider it.

2475
02:49:45,516 --> 02:49:47,541
Anything you would like to

2476
02:49:47,541 --> 02:49:48,703
still say, [name] and you?

2477
02:49:52,261 --> 02:49:53,622
I've talked a lot, so I

2478
02:49:53,622 --> 02:49:56,725
will leave you to say something first.

2479
02:49:56,725 --> 02:49:59,889
Yeah, I mean, documentation

2480
02:49:59,889 --> 02:50:04,673
is something you need to start from small.

2481
02:50:06,115 --> 02:50:08,737
You don't need to at the

2482
02:50:08,737 --> 02:50:12,081
first place to make a very

2483
02:50:12,081 --> 02:50:14,343
nice, very beautiful documentation

2484
02:50:14,343 --> 02:50:16,805
or even using Sphinx.

2485
02:50:18,527 --> 02:50:22,163
You can start from encode documentation.

2486
02:50:22,163 --> 02:50:25,247
or and then improve from

2487
02:50:25,247 --> 02:50:30,032
there to readme file or some other format.

2488
02:50:31,094 --> 02:50:34,498
And when the project scales up

2489
02:50:35,339 --> 02:50:37,862
and you needed to make

2490
02:50:37,862 --> 02:50:42,187
a more complex documentation, then

2491
02:50:42,187 --> 02:50:43,508
move to Sphinx.

2492
02:50:43,508 --> 02:50:48,014
It's a matter of iterations.

2493
02:50:48,975 --> 02:50:52,319
So yeah, I would say

2494
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:55,062
Don't be stressful.

2495
02:50:55,943 --> 02:50:58,625
Start from something basic

2496
02:50:58,625 --> 02:51:01,348
and, yeah, iterate a lot.

2497
02:51:01,348 --> 02:51:03,870
Encourage people, your colleagues,

2498
02:51:03,870 --> 02:51:06,953
to contribute to the documentation.

2499
02:51:11,078 --> 02:51:13,280
Yeah, I'd say that, well, I

2500
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:15,602
think one thing I would add

2501
02:51:15,602 --> 02:51:20,207
to this is, yeah, we try to

2502
02:51:20,207 --> 02:51:22,070
spend some time on the tools.

2503
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:24,774
i think that it's also um

2504
02:51:24,774 --> 02:51:26,557
there's also a lot of practice

2505
02:51:26,557 --> 02:51:27,478
and a lot of like

2506
02:51:27,478 --> 02:51:29,722
politics around documentation because

2507
02:51:29,722 --> 02:51:32,907
uh documentation is not something

2508
02:51:32,907 --> 02:51:36,192
you do only uh once it's you

2509
02:51:36,192 --> 02:51:37,814
know you create a website with

2510
02:51:37,814 --> 02:51:39,357
uh either a reading meal or

2511
02:51:39,357 --> 02:51:40,819
a website with things and then

2512
02:51:40,819 --> 02:51:42,662
not how many as you need to

2513
02:51:42,662 --> 02:51:44,344
keep it up to date and uh

2514
02:51:44,344 --> 02:51:47,990
and it's difficult and it's it

2515
02:51:47,990 --> 02:51:49,913
can be work and you need to

2516
02:51:49,913 --> 02:51:53,018
to keep that in mind, I would say.

2517
02:51:55,121 --> 02:51:55,682
Yeah.

2518
02:51:55,682 --> 02:51:56,504
And so the idea of

2519
02:51:56,504 --> 02:51:58,507
keeping documentation close to

2520
02:51:58,507 --> 02:52:00,810
your source code, of course,

2521
02:52:00,810 --> 02:52:03,435
makes things easier in this sense.

2522
02:52:04,276 --> 02:52:05,418
But then I think there are

2523
02:52:05,418 --> 02:52:07,661
also some tools to make documentation nicer.

2524
02:52:07,661 --> 02:52:08,663
So for example, if you have

2525
02:52:09,645 --> 02:52:11,327
nicer to easier to maintain,

2526
02:52:11,327 --> 02:52:13,471
for example, Jupyter Notebooks next week,

2527
02:52:13,471 --> 02:52:14,893
I think there are ways

2528
02:52:14,893 --> 02:52:16,415
to include Jupyter Notebooks

2529
02:52:16,415 --> 02:52:17,943
in your documentation.

2530
02:52:17,943 --> 02:52:20,466
and uh so that you have

2531
02:52:20,466 --> 02:52:22,308
you can write tutorials if

2532
02:52:22,308 --> 02:52:24,271
we're using jupiter notebooks and

2533
02:52:24,271 --> 02:52:25,953
uh yeah it's a bit advanced

2534
02:52:25,953 --> 02:52:27,114
it's a bit complicated but then

2535
02:52:27,114 --> 02:52:28,396
you can you have all the

2536
02:52:28,396 --> 02:52:30,318
tool links around jupiter notebooks

2537
02:52:30,318 --> 02:52:32,261
which is like validations uh

2538
02:52:32,261 --> 02:52:34,343
you know i mean there's there's

2539
02:52:34,343 --> 02:52:37,547
a lot of stuff there so um

2540
02:52:37,547 --> 02:52:40,711
yeah all right now we're two

2541
02:52:40,711 --> 02:52:43,323
two minutes over time yeah yeah yeah

2542
02:52:43,323 --> 02:52:44,986
So let's officially close here.

2543
02:52:44,986 --> 02:52:47,631
But we'll still hang out here for a moment.

2544
02:52:47,631 --> 02:52:49,094
And for those of you who

2545
02:52:49,094 --> 02:52:51,899
are interested in hosting your

2546
02:52:51,899 --> 02:52:54,264
own website on GitHub, you has

2547
02:52:54,264 --> 02:52:55,967
agreed that you can still show

2548
02:52:55,967 --> 02:52:57,390
us how to do that.

2549
02:52:57,390 --> 02:52:59,534
So the last session of today,

2550
02:52:59,534 --> 02:53:01,557
so you can stick around and

2551
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:04,844
maybe not type along, but at

2552
02:53:04,844 --> 02:53:07,049
least see what it's all about.

2553
02:53:07,049 --> 02:53:10,474
And then we'll also end here,

2554
02:53:10,474 --> 02:53:12,317
but thank you so much for joining today

2555
02:53:12,317 --> 02:53:13,439
and looking forward to, uh,

2556
02:53:14,781 --> 02:53:16,804
well, not really seeing, but

2557
02:53:16,804 --> 02:53:18,086
meeting you in the notes doc

2558
02:53:19,147 --> 02:53:21,651
next, uh, next week for Jupiter.

2559
02:53:21,651 --> 02:53:24,135
Okay.

2560
02:53:24,135 --> 02:53:25,537
And I think we just continue,

2561
02:53:26,859 --> 02:53:29,783
um, with you screen share.

2562
02:53:31,315 --> 02:53:35,000
But yeah, I think [name]

2563
02:53:36,623 --> 02:53:39,727
needs to... Well, you're still, I

2564
02:53:39,727 --> 02:53:44,594
think it's a yellow screen.

2565
02:53:48,099 --> 02:53:52,606
Okay, so are we ready to quit the stream?

2566
02:53:53,487 --> 02:53:56,491
No, no, let's go through

2567
02:53:56,491 --> 02:53:59,816
the hosting part still for five minutes.

2568
02:53:59,816 --> 02:54:01,018
Oh, sorry.

2569
02:54:02,247 --> 02:54:04,990
So we're already a bit over time.

2570
02:54:04,990 --> 02:54:05,430
No, no.

2571
02:54:05,430 --> 02:54:06,731
Yes, we ended already.

2572
02:54:06,731 --> 02:54:08,813
We ended already officially, but

2573
02:54:08,813 --> 02:54:10,775
this is now just extra.

2574
02:54:10,775 --> 02:54:11,436
Okay, sorry.

2575
02:54:11,436 --> 02:54:14,099
I'm not allowing.

2576
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:16,321
So, okay.

2577
02:54:16,321 --> 02:54:17,282
Hello.

2578
02:54:17,282 --> 02:54:18,163
So you want to continue

2579
02:54:18,163 --> 02:54:18,963
for another five minutes?

2580
02:54:18,963 --> 02:54:20,545
Is that okay?

2581
02:54:20,545 --> 02:54:21,246
Yeah.

2582
02:54:21,246 --> 02:54:21,646
Okay.

2583
02:54:21,646 --> 02:54:23,808
So then I will not close the stream.

2584
02:54:23,808 --> 02:54:24,028
Okay.

2585
02:54:24,028 --> 02:54:24,909
Thank you.

2586
02:54:24,909 --> 02:54:25,830
That's good to know.

2587
02:54:25,830 --> 02:54:26,090
Sorry.

2588
02:54:27,892 --> 02:54:28,873
Yeah.

2589
02:54:28,873 --> 02:54:30,735
Should I maybe...

2590
02:54:31,930 --> 02:54:34,413
recap something from this.

2591
02:54:37,898 --> 02:54:42,384
So basically, I think it

2592
02:54:44,166 --> 02:54:46,750
might be confusing because we

2593
02:54:47,611 --> 02:54:51,696
actually use the two services

2594
02:54:51,696 --> 02:54:54,259
from GitHub, the GitHub pages

2595
02:54:54,259 --> 02:54:55,661
and the GitHub actions.

2596
02:54:56,683 --> 02:55:00,047
So we basically need to configure both.

2597
02:55:00,905 --> 02:55:10,876
To configure GitHub actions, we

2598
02:55:10,876 --> 02:55:15,380
added this file, this YAML

2599
02:55:15,380 --> 02:55:18,844
file to configure GitHub actions.

2600
02:55:20,786 --> 02:55:22,768
That's for GitHub actions to

2601
02:55:23,729 --> 02:55:27,061
follow the steps to follow.

2602
02:55:27,061 --> 02:55:29,884
And we commented quite a lot

2603
02:55:29,884 --> 02:55:31,987
on this, I think, right?

2604
02:55:31,987 --> 02:55:33,228
I think we were clear on

2605
02:55:34,029 --> 02:55:34,830
the meanings of this.

2606
02:55:35,671 --> 02:55:36,572
Yeah.

2607
02:55:36,572 --> 02:55:37,633
Right.

2608
02:55:37,633 --> 02:55:37,953
Yeah.

2609
02:55:37,953 --> 02:55:41,718
So that's the thing.

2610
02:55:41,718 --> 02:55:44,561
And yeah, in addition to

2611
02:55:44,561 --> 02:55:46,383
the contents, another thing we

2612
02:55:46,383 --> 02:55:49,126
did is to configure Git pages.

2613
02:55:49,126 --> 02:55:53,251
So which is this part.

2614
02:55:53,251 --> 02:55:58,342
So from where to store the

2615
02:55:58,342 --> 02:56:01,449
built files and from where

2616
02:56:01,449 --> 02:56:03,614
to deploy the website.

2617
02:56:06,139 --> 02:56:08,745
I don't know if that's clear.

2618
02:56:11,189 --> 02:56:12,311
I hope so.

2619
02:56:12,311 --> 02:56:14,895
I guess that, yeah, we're a bit fast,

2620
02:56:14,895 --> 02:56:16,037
but I think that if people

2621
02:56:16,037 --> 02:56:18,761
look at the notes, everything

2622
02:56:18,761 --> 02:56:21,565
is explained relatively clearly there.

2623
02:56:21,565 --> 02:56:23,589
I think quite clearly there.

2624
02:56:23,589 --> 02:56:24,590
Yeah.

2625
02:56:24,590 --> 02:56:26,233
So basically two things, GitHub

2626
02:56:26,233 --> 02:56:27,435
Actions and GitHub Pages.

2627
02:56:28,637 --> 02:56:29,197
Yeah.

2628
02:56:29,197 --> 02:56:30,279
Yeah.

2629
02:56:30,279 --> 02:56:31,321
Did you also still want

2630
02:56:31,321 --> 02:56:35,675
to show the hosting, the last lesson?

2631
02:56:35,675 --> 02:56:37,398
They're all hosting personal

2632
02:56:37,398 --> 02:56:41,003
or project websites on GitHub pages.

2633
02:56:41,003 --> 02:56:42,745
That's the last page of

2634
02:56:42,745 --> 02:56:44,949
the... The homepage.

2635
02:56:44,949 --> 02:56:46,351
Go to the next.

2636
02:56:46,351 --> 02:56:46,811
Yeah.

2637
02:56:46,811 --> 02:56:49,315
So in addition to host a

2638
02:56:49,315 --> 02:56:51,358
webpage, we can also host

2639
02:56:51,358 --> 02:56:53,761
a homepage for ourselves.

2640
02:56:55,584 --> 02:56:57,226
Because the steps are very

2641
02:56:57,226 --> 02:56:59,870
clear from GitHub's documentation.

2642
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:03,015
So we would recommend

2643
02:57:03,015 --> 02:57:05,746
following those instructions to

2644
02:57:05,746 --> 02:57:09,651
to try out to host your

2645
02:57:09,651 --> 02:57:15,018
own homepage on GitHub.

2646
02:57:15,018 --> 02:57:16,039
That's this part.

2647
02:57:18,863 --> 02:57:21,366
So basically, it can take the README,

2648
02:57:21,366 --> 02:57:22,448
if I understand correctly, you

2649
02:57:22,448 --> 02:57:24,811
can take the README of your, that

2650
02:57:24,811 --> 02:57:26,773
you have in a repository, which

2651
02:57:26,773 --> 02:57:28,848
needs to have a specific name.

2652
02:57:28,848 --> 02:57:30,350
And then out of that,

2653
02:57:30,350 --> 02:57:33,075
it will create automatically a web

2654
02:57:33,075 --> 02:57:41,127
page for you or for your project.

2655
02:57:43,871 --> 02:57:49,580
So there are some very clear instructions.

2656
02:57:50,902 --> 02:57:56,388
It's not using Sphinx, but the default

2657
02:57:56,388 --> 02:58:02,074
no, sorry, [name], to deploy this website.

2658
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:08,661
Sorry, if someone wants to try it out,

2659
02:58:08,661 --> 02:58:11,104
they can follow the instructions

2660
02:58:11,104 --> 02:58:14,188
on the website.

2661
02:58:14,188 --> 02:58:15,769
And if there are any

2662
02:58:15,769 --> 02:58:19,493
questions, ask next week or in

2663
02:58:19,493 --> 02:58:23,472
our chat that is linked from the notes.

2664
02:58:23,472 --> 02:58:24,693
Yes, if you have any

2665
02:58:24,693 --> 02:58:27,255
questions regarding this or the

2666
02:58:27,255 --> 02:58:29,838
Sphinx Docs thing, then ask.

2667
02:58:31,279 --> 02:58:31,439
Yeah.

2668
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:32,700
Okay.

2669
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:33,581
Great.

2670
02:58:33,581 --> 02:58:35,763
Then I think, are we ready

2671
02:58:35,763 --> 02:58:37,625
to close the stream for today?

2672
02:58:37,625 --> 02:58:37,885
Yes.

2673
02:58:40,708 --> 02:58:40,828
Yeah.

2674
02:58:40,828 --> 02:58:41,168
All right.

2675
02:58:41,989 --> 02:58:43,170
Then let's do that.

2676
02:58:43,170 --> 02:58:44,031
Thank you for everybody

2677
02:58:44,031 --> 02:58:46,273
for sticking around.

2678
02:58:46,273 --> 02:58:46,954
Thanks.

2679
02:58:46,954 --> 02:58:48,535
Yes.

2680
02:58:48,535 --> 02:58:51,418
Thank you very much.

2681
02:58:51,418 --> 02:58:51,598
Bye-bye.

2682
02:58:51,598 --> 02:58:51,758
Bye-bye.
