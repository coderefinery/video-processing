1
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,408
Hello, hello.

2
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:19,734
Can you hear us out there?

3
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,738
Hello, hello.

4
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:23,862
Hello.

5
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:24,564
See us out there?

6
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,131
Let's see if our friends on

7
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:31,858
Zulip, they can give us some feedback.

8
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:37,675
So far.

9
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,456
Yes, yes.

10
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,619
We are fine.

11
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:44,864
Should we have a quick sound check?

12
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,686
Let's just say our name.

13
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,148
Maybe the sound check could be this.

14
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,890
We introduce ourselves very

15
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,412
short, very briefly.

16
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:54,556
And so we need to all take turns.

17
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:55,677
And I will say the next person.

18
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:56,919
I'm going to start me.

19
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm [name].

20
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,063
I'm [name] from Aalto University.

21
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:03,227
And I'm coordinating this run

22
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,910
of the CodeRefinery Workshop with [name].

23
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,713
Hi everyone, my name is [name],

24
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,315
Research Software Engineer at

25
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:13,297
CSC in Finland and

26
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,059
co-coordinating this workshop and

27
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:19,644
today doing the very short intro and outro.

28
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,526
And [name] is one of the teachers here.

29
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:24,189
Hi everyone, I'm [name].

30
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,690
I'm a Research Software Engineer

31
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,432
at Aalto University and I'm

32
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:30,455
going to teach about Jupyter

33
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,039
Notebook alongside with [name] here.

34
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,961
Hey, I'm [name], also a

35
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,138
Research Software Engineer from Aalto.

36
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,962
And today, instead of clicking

37
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,785
the camera buttons, I'm going

38
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:49,750
to be teaching Jupyter Notebooks.

39
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,672
And we are very excited for today's lesson.

40
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,976
So what you're seeing on

41
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,379
screen currently is our notes document.

42
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,641
So if you register to the

43
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,562
workshop, you got an email

44
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,510
basically right now, I guess.

45
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,133
With all the links for today,

46
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,034
and this is one of them,

47
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,737
and this is the most important one.

48
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,240
And that includes all the

49
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,362
links to other documents.

50
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,666
And this is also the way on

51
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,968
how you can ask questions

52
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:18,731
during the whole session today.

53
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:19,932
And we will have our

54
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:22,136
instructors, [name] and [name],

55
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,498
and other people behind the

56
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,681
scenes answering your questions there.

57
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:28,546
And we will also archive

58
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,828
them after the workshop, so you

59
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:30,589
can always come back.

60
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,393
And maybe, [name], we show

61
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,398
briefly how people can edit this document.

62
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:37,440
So you will probably see

63
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,681
something like what is shown

64
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:40,705
on screen right now, when you

65
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,588
follow the link to the notes and

66
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:45,112
then up to the left or

67
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,414
up to the right, depending on

68
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,177
how wide your window is, you

69
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:49,759
will find this little pen symbol.

70
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:52,426
And if you click that, you

71
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,408
go into edit mode and then

72
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:56,830
you can actually edit this document.

73
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,972
And for example, start by

74
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,954
filling in and answering our

75
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,436
icebreakers for today.

76
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:06,700
So we have prepared some for you here.

77
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,384
And maybe I ask today's

78
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,206
instructors about the first one.

79
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:14,127
So if you could have a

80
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,470
fully paid holiday right now,

81
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,051
we are covering all your costs.

82
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,553
What would that be?

83
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:21,160
Where would you like to go?

84
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,902
[name], do you have any big

85
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,164
dreams for a vacation?

86
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,106
Yeah, I guess I would go

87
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:29,107
and visit my nieces.

88
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,529
Yeah, that's something that I

89
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,150
always wanted to do.

90
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:34,792
How about you, [name]?

91
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:39,657
Right now I'm thinking just

92
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,818
in a forest nearby somewhere

93
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,741
because it might be fun to

94
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:49,125
go to some mountains or something, but...

95
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,226
It's still a bit too warm to go south.

96
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,929
And also being on an

97
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,751
airplane doesn't really strike me

98
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,973
as something I would want to do today.

99
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:02,678
Oh yeah, we're all in Finland today.

100
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:05,241
We have currently, what do we have?

101
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,943
Maybe 10, 15 degrees?

102
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:07,423
Quite warm.

103
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,826
A bit gray, but colorful.

104
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:14,151
Yeah, it's 13, but yeah, it's grayish.

105
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,918
How about [name]?

106
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,821
I'm the one who wrote that

107
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,244
I would like to go to a

108
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,690
warm place with a swimming pool or by the sea.

109
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,036
Maybe in October in Finland.

110
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:28,457
I don't know.

111
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,022
The others who are watching and

112
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,805
who are typing, you can

113
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,027
tell about your weather.

114
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:35,689
But now Finland starts this

115
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,492
season, which is the worst season.

116
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:38,654
The snow is not yet there.

117
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:41,198
Days are getting shorter.

118
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:44,563
The darkness is filling everything.

119
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:48,328
So it's like I miss the sun.

120
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,692
In neuroscience, there's usually

121
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:51,893
a big conference, which is

122
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,135
called Society for Neuroscience.

123
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:53,936
And that ends at the end

124
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,479
of November or middle of November.

125
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:58,023
And it rotates between locations.

126
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:01,027
And once every four years is in San Diego.

127
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,295
And so a couple of times I

128
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:04,699
was able to go there and it

129
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,204
was just like in the middle

130
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:07,649
of November leaving Finland and

131
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,395
going to San Diego for a week.

132
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:12,666
It was just, so yeah.

133
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,669
What about you [name]?

134
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,359
I think I'm with [name] there.

135
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,243
Like, I don't need much at the moment.

136
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:21,464
And just going out into

137
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,488
the forest seems like very nice.

138
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:25,709
Maybe if I could wish for

139
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,071
anything, then I would wish

140
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:30,976
for some like autumn sun and no rain.

141
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,138
But forest sounds pretty good.

142
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,421
A bit more sunny would be nice.

143
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,143
Also, there's mushrooms.

144
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,105
There is mushrooms.

145
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:39,626
It's the best time of

146
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:40,936
the year for mushrooms.

147
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:41,937
I always wanted to learn

148
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:43,680
about mushrooms more.

149
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,402
Yeah, maybe this year is the year.

150
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,928
We also have two more questions here.

151
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,491
Do you have a paper notebook at hand?

152
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,614
And I actually really have it at hand here.

153
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,735
One is my to-do list and

154
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:58,639
the other one is my brain dump notebook.

155
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,261
How about you?

156
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:03,190
I also have one, but it's a

157
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,113
bit far away to reach it.

158
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,135
And I also have an iPad

159
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:12,981
if that counts, I don't know.

160
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:15,264
It's not exactly paper, but

161
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,726
for some reason I have two pens,

162
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:18,668
but I do not have anything to write on.

163
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,110
It has like pencil and you

164
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,151
can write stuff, right?

165
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,394
So I guess it counts.

166
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:26,197
Well, sometimes also the notes

167
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:27,378
make it on my hand if

168
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,040
I need to remember something like

169
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,915
to do when leaving this room, for example.

170
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:32,897
And I'll write it on my

171
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:35,384
hand so that it doesn't vanish immediately.

172
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:40,737
How about [name]?

173
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,702
Do you use paper notebooks or any other?

174
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:46,537
I used to, but then because

175
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:49,221
I'm always in different places

176
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,923
and I forget things around.

177
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:51,805
So in the end post-its,

178
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:53,968
I write something on a post-it,

179
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,130
put it in my pocket.

180
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,931
And then when it's the time

181
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,635
to do the weekly laundry, I

182
00:10:58,635 --> 00:10:59,677
have to remember to empty my

183
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:01,359
pocket from the post-its, otherwise

184
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,322
it's not going to be nice.

185
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:07,508
That's also nice.

186
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,453
And then we have one

187
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,968
question more related to today's session.

188
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,169
what is your way of working

189
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,591
when it comes to writing code

190
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:17,852
for your research projects?

191
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:19,234
And we have still three minutes.

192
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,756
So maybe [name], do you want

193
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:22,378
to share about your way of working?

194
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,662
Well, it depends a lot on the project.

195
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,787
So right now I'm working

196
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:33,711
on something with Django where there's like,

197
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:34,772
you run a command and it

198
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:37,115
runs the whole thing as a

199
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,898
test server and you can play around with it.

200
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,166
So then I just write Python code.

201
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,848
But otherwise, I would always

202
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:45,349
have a Jupyter notebook on the side

203
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:50,994
and essentially refresh, reload everything,

204
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:54,438
and then run some commands

205
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:57,421
to see what comes up and

206
00:11:57,421 --> 00:12:00,103
be writing Python code on the other side.

207
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,687
How fitting with today's topic.

208
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,509
So an expert in the topic.

209
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,145
[name], how about you?

210
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,929
I would say it really

211
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,734
depends on the project that I'm doing.

212
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,619
If it's like a data

213
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,383
heavy driven project that I have

214
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,867
to do some experiments with the

215
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,651
data and I don't know the

216
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:23,223
data, the Jupyter notebooks

217
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,306
are the way that I'm using them.

218
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,089
But most of the time, I'm

219
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,792
not working on those kind of stuff.

220
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,856
I'm mainly doing AI, LLM,

221
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:32,838
neural networks and stuff.

222
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,422
And also, Jupyter Notebooks can

223
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,485
be useful in those cases as well.

224
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,448
But I guess these are

225
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:41,531
not the best practices for those.

226
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:44,896
So I'm usually using pure Python

227
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,340
or C to do some stuff.

228
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,625
And a reminder for everyone

229
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,647
joining, we are currently

230
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,454
discussing the icebreaker questions.

231
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:58,476
We will be starting in

232
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:01,262
about one minute with the actual course.

233
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:02,445
[name], how about you?

234
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:04,128
Do you use Jupyter notebooks?

235
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:07,553
Well, the first one is mine.

236
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,915
It's nice to prototype with

237
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:11,478
this type of graphical or

238
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,321
semi-graphical tools, Jupyter.

239
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:14,522
I also use RStudio.

240
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:18,187
But then I always, at the end, convert

241
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:20,651
that into a script so that I know

242
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,972
that I can kind of run

243
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:25,017
it without any, how can I

244
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,079
say, interactive input that the

245
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,742
orders are processed.

246
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,043
Well, I don't want to spoil the fun.

247
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,766
You will hear about these things today.

248
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:32,667
So...

249
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,373
Yes, and at least my clock

250
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:38,896
is also showing top of the

251
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:42,581
hour, one o'clock in Finnish time.

252
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:46,626
So let's get started with today's session.

253
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,688
And I would ask [name] to

254
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:50,891
change to the view mode again,

255
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:55,717
and for now show the event page first.

256
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,710
The CodeRefinery.

257
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,391
Yes.

258
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:03,634
So very welcome everyone to

259
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,579
this session of the CodeRefinery Workshop,

260
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:08,299
where we are going to

261
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:11,003
talk about Jupyter Notebooks.

262
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,166
I'm here with [name], who

263
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,868
is manning the stream today

264
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:18,552
and handling that you can all see and hear us.

265
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:20,254
And then we have [name] and

266
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:23,779
[name], who will be instructing today's session.

267
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,246
My name is [name].

268
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:27,268
I'm the project manager for

269
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:29,271
the CodeRefinery project and

270
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:31,193
just introducing today's topic.

271
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:32,054
And you will also see me

272
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:33,115
briefly in the very end.

273
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,039
We are now showing on

274
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,423
stream our event webpage where

275
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,065
you can always find all the

276
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,948
latest news, what is going on.

277
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,630
You can also find the

278
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,492
questions from previous sessions

279
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,755
and what's gonna happen in the next session.

280
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:54,220
And if we scroll quite a bit down,

281
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,143
There is also the schedule

282
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,745
with all the different days.

283
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:58,806
This is the same page where

284
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,948
you also all registered.

285
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,672
And there you can find

286
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:04,014
behind Jupyter Notebooks.

287
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:06,016
That's the link to today's materials.

288
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:07,859
And then you have gotten

289
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,581
an email probably just a few

290
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,866
moments ago where we shared also

291
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,648
the link to our collaborative notes.

292
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:15,790
So let's switch to that one.

293
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,502
So that is the link

294
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,945
to our collaborative notes.

295
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,709
Again, all the links, also

296
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,573
a suggestion on screen set

297
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,139
up and our icebreakers.

298
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,603
And this is also the place

299
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,026
where you can ask questions

300
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:32,324
throughout the session today.

301
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:34,126
And in order to do that,

302
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:35,428
you will need to go into

303
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,630
edit mode of this document.

304
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,032
So if you arrive at this

305
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:40,253
page, you can look at the

306
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,015
very top of the document.

307
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,417
There will be either on the left

308
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,439
where it is for [name] right now,

309
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,041
or on the top right, a

310
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,125
little pen symbol that turns the

311
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,087
page into edit mode.

312
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:53,028
And then you can start

313
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,510
filling in the icebreaker.

314
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,252
Let us know if you're

315
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:59,358
using paper notebooks.

316
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,700
for example, at this moment, or also

317
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,522
what is your way of working

318
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:04,903
when you are writing code?

319
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,004
Are you having any

320
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,066
experiences with Jupyter, for example?

321
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,309
And then during the session,

322
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,132
like it is happening right now, very nicely,

323
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,635
someone will add headers to

324
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:18,036
this document and also the

325
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:22,841
links to the respective material

326
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:24,022
session that you can always

327
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,964
follow along what [name] and [name]

328
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,786
are doing at the time.

329
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,247
And then you can ask the questions

330
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,973
there whenever they come up

331
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:32,834
during the session.

332
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,901
One last word about code

333
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,223
of conduct, please.

334
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,445
Since everyone can edit this

335
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,007
document, be nice to one

336
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,369
another, be considerate.

337
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,511
Everyone here is on a

338
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,674
different journey at a different

339
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:48,939
stage in their learning experience.

340
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,873
So take that into consideration.

341
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:53,457
when you are also answering question,

342
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:54,681
which you are very free to do

343
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,065
if you know the answer to

344
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,769
some of the questions that are appearing here.

345
00:16:58,612 --> 00:16:59,915
And with that, I'll give over

346
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:02,683
to [name] and [name] and have

347
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,448
fun with Jupyter today.

348
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah.

349
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,202
Thank you, [name].

350
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:08,462
Thanks.

351
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:10,786
Okay.

352
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:12,850
I will switch to the main

353
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:15,714
page of the Jupyter Notebook course.

354
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:18,299
So if you follow the workshop page

355
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,040
and you click on the

356
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,002
Jupyter Notebooks, this is the

357
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,003
page that you are going to see.

358
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:24,529
And yeah, maybe I can start.

359
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:27,816
so ... when I think

360
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:29,278
about Jupyter notebooks actually I

361
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:31,902
have a double like a dual feeling

362
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:33,504
so sometimes I really like it

363
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:34,946
to you to use Jupyter notebooks

364
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,029
and sometimes I don't and I

365
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,950
don't think it's like the best

366
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,632
practice to use that and I

367
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:40,974
guess the whole point of this

368
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:43,037
session is to learn about Jupyter notebooks

369
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,559
and see what are the main

370
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,261
strengths of it and what are

371
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,084
the pitfalls of it so Jupyter

372
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,547
notebooks are not the answer to do everything

373
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:53,178
but it can be a very powerful use

374
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:54,122
for sharing the code, for

375
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:55,809
doing some experiments, and you're

376
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,857
going to learn that hopefully in this session.

377
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,605
So what are the Jupyter

378
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:02,786
Notebooks and what is the

379
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,288
main motivation behind it?

380
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:07,411
So when you think about like a pure file,

381
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,133
like a coding file, like a Python file

382
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:12,117
or like a C++ file that you have the code,

383
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:13,298
the only way that you can

384
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:15,621
annotate the code is to add

385
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,343
some comments into it, right?

386
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:20,547
But Jupyter Notebooks bring another way.

387
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,950
And in addition to your code,

388
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,753
you can have text marked down

389
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:28,516
on HTML code or like a

390
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:31,584
equation figures and everything

391
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,972
all integrated into a same document

392
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:37,278
so you have more ways to

393
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:38,742
annotate your code and explain

394
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,587
the workflow and explain the data

395
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,850
and also play with data

396
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,760
So this is a screenshot

397
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,844
of two different Jupyter notebooks.

398
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,487
And on the left, you can see

399
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:52,191
that we have a block of code.

400
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:54,094
And in Jupyter notebooks, these

401
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:55,736
blocks are called the cell.

402
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,719
So we have a cell of code.

403
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,141
And the output of the code,

404
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:01,505
which is a table essentially,

405
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,548
is also shown there as well.

406
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:05,010
but on the right you can

407
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,792
see that there are like some headings

408
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,174
and with the text it can

409
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:10,016
be like some equations or as

410
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,739
you can see there are like some tables here

411
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,902
as well so the code is running

412
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,504
and also you can see the result

413
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,326
and when you're saving it you

414
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:18,728
can see all of the material

415
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:21,472
at the same place not just your code

416
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:25,297
so it's ... really nice for

417
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,080
telling a story ... and

418
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,143
yeah one additional reason so you

419
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,845
can do nice formatting and so

420
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,097
on to make it like

421
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:34,620
easily readable and the tables

422
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,741
look better and so on.

423
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,845
But one big thing that to

424
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,648
me is especially important is

425
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:43,354
that the output is immediately after the input.

426
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:45,558
So you can actually tell it in order

427
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,063
and the comments are usually

428
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,846
pretty far from wherever the

429
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:52,469
output appears in the terminal or

430
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:53,651
Yeah, exactly.

431
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,397
So when you're coming back

432
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:59,282
to your experiment after a couple of months

433
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,585
or when you're sharing your

434
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:01,827
code with someone else, it's

435
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,012
very, very easy to follow because

436
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,795
you can see the code, you can see the output,

437
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,058
and you can also add

438
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:09,482
some explanation like equations or

439
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:12,368
text or plots to support that.

440
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:16,346
... so as I mentioned ...

441
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:18,790
a Jupyter notebook can be thought

442
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,192
as like a notebook like

443
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,056
your paper notebook that you have

444
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,017
but it also has your

445
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:24,841
code your equation your text

446
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,003
everything inside and it's like

447
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:27,485
very easy to share and like

448
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,629
to like read and follow ...

449
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,352
block by block or cell by cell

450
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,440
A fun fact is that the

451
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,025
Jupyter name is coming from

452
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,132
the combination of Julia and Python

453
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:39,760
and R, but today you can

454
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,446
also use it with other languages

455
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:42,509
and there are like some kernels

456
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,933
that you can use for other

457
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,000
languages to apply to Jupyter Notebook.

458
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:53,939
So Jupyter Notebook format, as we see here,

459
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,121
is commonly used, and I

460
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,865
guess it's more popular nowadays.

461
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:00,747
I have seen some entire

462
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:03,251
books written in Jupyter Notebook formats,

463
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,493
and I guess you have been also seeing

464
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,636
that here and there, especially

465
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:10,600
if you have worked with Google Colab.

466
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,664
Like the interface is essentially

467
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:13,666
a Jupyter Notebook that you

468
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,929
have different blocks that you can

469
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,234
add text or code in it.

470
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,097
But the Jupyter Notebook formats

471
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:20,901
can be also run, for example,

472
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,384
in VS Code, which we hopefully

473
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:25,250
show in a short demonstration.

474
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,934
And also GitHub Codespaces also

475
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:30,401
support the similar interface that

476
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,022
we can take a look.

477
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,837
There's also Pluto, which is

478
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,779
more directly like a Jupyter

479
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,720
notebook these days.

480
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:42,985
So it's a Julia thing and

481
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,827
has a somewhat different philosophy,

482
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,409
but I've seen it a lot lately.

483
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,792
I never worked with Pluto, but

484
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,913
when I was doing Julia, it

485
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:53,616
was mainly the JupyterLab thing

486
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,877
to work with Julia.

487
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:56,539
It's interesting.

488
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,820
I will check it out.

489
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:02,160
So actually, maybe we can take

490
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,503
a look at an example.

491
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:05,664
So here we have two

492
00:22:05,664 --> 00:22:07,246
different examples that we can

493
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:10,290
go ahead and browse.

494
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,171
I guess in the past

495
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:14,075
CodeRefinery lessons previous years,

496
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:15,877
we always look at the wave discovery thing.

497
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,379
So maybe this year we can

498
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,283
look at the activity inequality study, I guess.

499
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:22,325
But maybe I can also briefly

500
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:23,787
show the first one as well.

501
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,109
So the activity in quality

502
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:26,752
study was a study, I guess,

503
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:28,896
in 2017 from Stanford University.

504
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:32,162
And it demonstrates inequality

505
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:33,926
of activity in different countries

506
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:34,787
and inside the country

507
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,871
between different genders, different

508
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,616
race, and different age groups.

509
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,241
So just to see what

510
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,683
the Jupyter Notebook looks like,

511
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:45,206
you can go ahead and look at the paper,

512
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,408
but just to see how are

513
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,532
the plots created in Jupyter

514
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,694
Notebook, maybe I can go ahead

515
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:55,043
and open the GitHub repository very briefly.

516
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:58,978
And for example, maybe I can

517
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,983
take a look at the figure number three.

518
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:03,728
And you can see that

519
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:05,612
IPython notebooks, these are

520
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,676
the Python notebooks, like Jupyter

521
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:10,242
notebooks that you can open and see.

522
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:11,705
Let's, for example, open the

523
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,192
figure three section B and C.

524
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,234
So yeah, these are essentially

525
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,858
the sections or the cells

526
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,460
in a Jupyter Notebook.

527
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,922
So you can see there is

528
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:29,748
a cell with code inside.

529
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:31,070
There is a cell, for example,

530
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,595
with a text or a heading for the weekday here.

531
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:37,420
And there are some reading of the data.

532
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,701
And when the code is run

533
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,023
and the plot is shown, as

534
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,245
[name] mentioned, it's very nice

535
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,028
that you can see actually.

536
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:46,762
Although in this world, yeah, I guess.

537
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:48,945
The gravitational wave notebook

538
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:51,369
is more like an actual story.

539
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,673
This is more like it's

540
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:57,439
code with very little even comments about it.

541
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,263
So this is essentially just

542
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:01,825
the code that produces the plot.

543
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,630
And it is in a Jupyter

544
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,053
notebook where you can see the plot.

545
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,475
So that's nice.

546
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:11,078
Yeah, but I guess it shows

547
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:14,666
how the Jupyter Notebook cells are created.

548
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,969
But maybe, yeah, that's true.

549
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:19,597
Maybe we can go back to the code.

550
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,022
So this is not necessarily a bad example,

551
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:24,507
but I think the gravitational

552
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:26,211
wave thing is a better example

553
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,556
in that it actually tells a story.

554
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:28,716
Yeah.

555
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,406
So maybe I can actually go

556
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:35,334
ahead and open the tutorial here.

557
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,759
So for example, the QuickView Notebook.

558
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:38,962
So you can either write in

559
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:41,768
Google Colab or you can open it in MyBinder.

560
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:43,371
And MyBinder is, I guess

561
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,674
we're going to talk about it

562
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:46,718
in the sharing section of this course.

563
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,721
But yeah, my MyBinder essentially

564
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,145
is a tool that you can share your notebooks,

565
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:52,367
and it would take care of

566
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,191
all of the dependencies that you have.

567
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:56,734
For example, your Python code,

568
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:58,236
all of the libraries, or if

569
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,478
your code isn't run with all

570
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:01,541
of the packages, it would be installed.

571
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,803
So when you're sharing the

572
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,726
code, everyone can access it,

573
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:05,948
and they can also run the

574
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:08,071
code and see the ports and everything.

575
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,974
So if I click on my binder

576
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:14,481
here, I guess it would take a couple of minutes.

577
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,120
I guess like 10 seconds or so,

578
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,485
but behind the scene probably

579
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,129
is like opening the environment

580
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:22,912
and activating the environment.

581
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,957
Oh, it had it pre-created.

582
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:29,947
So it is possible that it will just create,

583
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,189
it will build and create

584
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,193
the entire environment where the

585
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:34,424
code can be run.

586
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:36,828
Because the main thing about Binder is

587
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,231
that it doesn't just display

588
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:39,934
the notebook, you can actually run

589
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,316
the code in the notebook.

590
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:42,458
Exactly.

591
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,740
So you can see that again

592
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,604
that I have different blocks

593
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:48,228
or different cells and this cell

594
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:50,312
has like the markdown and

595
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:52,175
headings and everything and these

596
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,898
are like Python codes.

597
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:54,880
So I can go ahead and

598
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,927
select the cell and for example run the code.

599
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:01,490
And I can change the code as well.

600
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,552
For example, I can do

601
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:04,695
the experiment with changing this one

602
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:06,057
to L1, as it's mentioned here,

603
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:08,099
and run the code.

604
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,302
And this is a raw text, so

605
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,724
if I run it, it doesn't

606
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:13,727
change the headings or anything.

607
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:14,929
I can go ahead and run,

608
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,253
for example, the next block of

609
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:22,359
the code as well, and also

610
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,783
possibly running the time series.

611
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,385
This would possibly take a

612
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,647
couple of seconds as well.

613
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:31,470
And then after the time series is done,

614
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,691
maybe we can plot it again

615
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,154
so we can see the difference in plot.

616
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,335
But I guess because we only

617
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:39,299
changed it from H1 to L1,

618
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,744
the plot would just slightly change.

619
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:45,045
Oh, let's see.

620
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,430
Let's see.

621
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,411
OK, I don't actually know

622
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:52,167
if there's a difference.

623
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,410
Yeah, it has slightly changed

624
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,993
because I ran it before, but

625
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:56,654
it's a slight change.

626
00:26:56,654 --> 00:26:58,056
But still, you can see that.

627
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,620
But you can do the beta plus.

628
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,180
I think I changed the

629
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,162
colors and everything.

630
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,484
But the idea is that I'm

631
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:06,208
going to talk about in more

632
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,511
details what you can do with the cells.

633
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:09,713
But just to give you an

634
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,796
idea, I think this is enough.

635
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:14,812
So yeah, maybe I can go

636
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,919
back to the course material.

637
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:17,882
I don't save it.

638
00:27:17,882 --> 00:27:19,326
I would go back.

639
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:20,630
But you can feel free to

640
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,435
go and browse more figures and

641
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:23,659
see what is happening.

642
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,680
So as I mentioned at the beginning,

643
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,002
when it comes to the

644
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:29,423
Jupyter Notebooks, I have a

645
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:30,505
dual feeling about it.

646
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:33,909
And because Jupyter Notebooks are

647
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:35,331
very good in some of the

648
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:38,374
use cases, especially when you

649
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:41,478
have a workflow that is linear,

650
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:43,761
which means you have some data

651
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:47,125
and you want to do some experiments on it.

652
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,249
And it's like an iterative

653
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:51,871
approach that you want to apply.

654
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,253
So these are very, very good

655
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:56,576
use cases for Jupyter Notebooks.

656
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:58,658
Experimenting with new ideas or

657
00:27:58,658 --> 00:27:59,859
with new libraries, or when you

658
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,021
have a new data set that

659
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,582
you haven't worked with it,

660
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:05,265
again, it's very good because you

661
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,007
can play with the data.

662
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,048
And as you already mentioned,

663
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:10,831
you can see the results immediately afterwards.

664
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:12,152
So you get a better sense

665
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,874
than writing a code that reads

666
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:14,995
the data, and then you have

667
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,697
to recompile the code every time.

668
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:19,514
I see Jupyter Notebooks as

669
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:22,919
like an interactive way to work

670
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,861
with your code and data specifically

671
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:26,664
because you're changing something

672
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,345
and you're seeing the

673
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:28,226
results, you're changing the

674
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:29,988
something and you're changing the results.

675
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:32,051
And with the more powerful

676
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:33,193
things like widgets that we

677
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:34,535
are going to discuss, you

678
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:36,237
can actually make your Jupyter

679
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:38,700
Notebook more interactive, which is

680
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,125
like a very fun way to play with your data.

681
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,368
These days, a lot of

682
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:46,230
HPC clusters also provide

683
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,515
a Jupyter-ready environment.

684
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:51,878
So for example, here at Aalto on Triton,

685
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:54,982
we have Jupyter available on

686
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,324
the web browser.

687
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:58,186
Also, Lumi supports that.

688
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,209
So in addition to playing with your data,

689
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,151
you can actually run it on

690
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:03,533
one of the compute nodes with

691
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,676
all of the fancy resources of

692
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:09,361
many CPUs to a huge memory or even

693
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,573
a GPU course in some of the clusters,

694
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:13,583
which makes playing with the

695
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:17,464
data even more fun, I guess.

696
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:21,282
sharing and explaining the code

697
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:22,885
to others or like to just

698
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:24,287
remember it in the future

699
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:25,869
it's actually very good ...

700
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:26,931
as you already mentioned like

701
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,453
telling their story behind like

702
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:30,196
why I'm doing this experiment

703
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,660
why these hyper parameters are set

704
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,282
or like just writing the story

705
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:36,846
of ... what you are doing in

706
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:39,290
the code is like a very powerful

707
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,173
use case of the Jupyter notebooks

708
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:43,250
If you're a teacher and

709
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,672
you're teaching something, it's also

710
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,193
a very good use case.

711
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:47,575
As I mentioned, I've seen

712
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:52,480
entire books written in Jupyter Notebook.

713
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,581
And I remember when I was

714
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:55,363
a student in many of

715
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:57,966
the computer science courses, we had

716
00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:00,128
a lot of the assignments were in Jupyter

717
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:03,452
that the idea of the assignment were there,

718
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:04,673
the story were there as well,

719
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:05,574
and some of the blocks of

720
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:06,535
the code were empty that

721
00:30:06,535 --> 00:30:08,657
the assignment was meant for

722
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,600
the students to fill it out.

723
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,423
And I guess it's also very easy

724
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,847
for the teacher to create

725
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,791
these kind of assignments as

726
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,314
well, because you just run all

727
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:19,696
of the code and see.

728
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:21,159
And even if you don't run

729
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,563
it, you would see the plots and the output.

730
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,326
So you get that.

731
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,530
There is an automated grading system

732
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,774
for Jupyter Notebooks, but then

733
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,859
you have to essentially have a correct answer.

734
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:33,685
Yeah.

735
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:36,108
a correct format also for the answer.

736
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,871
But when all of the cells are run,

737
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,475
and then you save it, all

738
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:41,737
of the plots and the outputs

739
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:43,399
are also saved along it.

740
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:45,342
So even without running all of the code,

741
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:47,705
you can get a sense that

742
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:48,847
if the student actually did it.

743
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,930
But I think it's not a

744
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,572
topic for this section, but yeah.

745
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:56,203
You can also replace your

746
00:30:56,203 --> 00:31:00,128
paper notebook if you want to, I guess.

747
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,932
And at the moment, there

748
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:05,937
is a whole community around Jupyter Notebooks.

749
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:07,579
So there are a lot of plugins

750
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:10,083
or other side tools that, for example,

751
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,505
you can create slide

752
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:13,808
presentations with Jupyter Notebooks.

753
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:15,130
So it's like a powerful...

754
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,534
Probably the most common use

755
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,678
case is kind of a scratch pad.

756
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,161
So you're not exactly telling a story,

757
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,383
you're just seeing what happens

758
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,725
if you write this code.

759
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:27,131
And then probably discard it or

760
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:29,375
move it to the correct

761
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,678
function or something like that.

762
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:33,743
Which kind of does actually

763
00:31:33,743 --> 00:31:34,925
bleed into the pitfalls.

764
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:37,290
Yeah, that's true.

765
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,705
But yeah.

766
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:41,468
But speaking of pitfalls,

767
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:42,889
Jupyter notebooks are not the answer

768
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:44,991
for everything, especially the

769
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,612
Jupyter notebooks are not good if

770
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,115
you have a very complex code flow

771
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,816
and it's more suitable for

772
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:53,179
a linear one that you run

773
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,440
the code block by block.

774
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,582
But if you have a more complex one,

775
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,963
Jupyter notebooks are not the

776
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,044
answer and it would just

777
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,325
make it very complicated.

778
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:02,507
If you have a large code base,

779
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:03,828
although there are some

780
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:05,770
approaches to create a module

781
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,612
and call the module and everything,

782
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:09,982
Personally, I don't recommend it.

783
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:12,171
I don't think it's a best practice.

784
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,557
It's just for showcasing and

785
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,132
telling the story, I would say.

786
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:22,703
It is not very easy to write a notebook,

787
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:24,105
like Jupyter notebook, without a

788
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:26,388
plugin or without an extra application.

789
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:27,730
Also, it's possible to do it

790
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,013
in any text editor

791
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,995
because underneath, essentially, it's

792
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:33,477
like a JSON file.

793
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:36,942
But with a plugin, it's a lot easier.

794
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:39,505
So maybe that's also a pitfall.

795
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:41,728
... notebooks can be version controlled

796
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,332
but again without any plugin

797
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,533
with an additional plugin or

798
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,656
like a platform it can

799
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:49,939
cause some issues specifically if

800
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:52,703
you have plots or tables embedded

801
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,045
which are the whole point

802
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:55,947
of the having Jupyter notebooks

803
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:59,452
I guess so that's also a limitation there

804
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,539
And I don't know still why, but

805
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,847
when you are creating the Jupyter Notebook,

806
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:05,914
it's not named by default and

807
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:08,663
it can be actually a very huge problem.

808
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:10,028
And this is specifically

809
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:12,985
about JupyterLab, actually.

810
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:15,569
... but but ... it's actually

811
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,472
like it doesn't look like a

812
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:20,096
very huge downside but when you are working

813
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:23,141
and ... it everyone has this experience

814
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:25,444
that ... they forgot to to

815
00:33:25,444 --> 00:33:27,327
rename the file and then after

816
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:28,649
a couple of weeks they came

817
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:30,812
back and like just looking on

818
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:33,296
the untitled files so when

819
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:34,999
you're creating a one just

820
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,623
don't forget to rename it at the beginning

821
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,406
But yeah, you can look at

822
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:43,311
our internal page for more pitfalls.

823
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,155
And some of the good practices to follow,

824
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:47,417
as I mentioned, always,

825
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:50,421
always, always remember to rename

826
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,043
the file when you are working with JupyterLab.

827
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:55,128
And before sharing and also

828
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,170
saving the code, it's always good

829
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,392
to run all of the cells, all

830
00:33:58,392 --> 00:33:59,654
of the blocks of the code.

831
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:00,896
So you are making sure

832
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:04,401
that everything is supposed as it

833
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,863
should be, as you expected it.

834
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:07,545
Yeah.

835
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,157
Essentially, I have over a

836
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:13,259
long period of time developed

837
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,341
the habit of always restarting

838
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:17,042
the kernel and always running

839
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:19,024
all the cells from top to bottom.

840
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:21,466
Even if it's a scratch pad, like

841
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:22,747
even if I'm just trying things out,

842
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:24,068
I will never go and run

843
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:25,309
the cells out of order because

844
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,431
that just leads to problems.

845
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:29,293
I wish there was a

846
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,234
way of completely disabling that feature.

847
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,577
Yeah, but it's very good

848
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,159
for the linear workflow as I mentioned.

849
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,880
So like going block by block, I guess.

850
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,781
Yeah.

851
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:45,631
Maybe we can go to the

852
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:49,523
interface and take a look at

853
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:55,099
the interface very briefly.

854
00:34:56,345 --> 00:35:00,852
If you created the conda environment,

855
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:02,394
which I guess you did

856
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,557
already, you should be able to

857
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,120
run the JupyterLab.

858
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,382
But just to demonstrate, I

859
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:10,627
will bring my terminal over here.

860
00:35:10,627 --> 00:35:15,374
And I already have the environment.

861
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,616
So I would just go ahead

862
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:20,682
and make a directory like JupyterLab demo.

863
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:24,589
I would go inside that library

864
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,740
and by calling the, actually

865
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,131
my environment is not activated.

866
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,676
Yes, I would activate my

867
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:34,502
CodeRefinery September 2025.

868
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:37,647
often this would be conda activate

869
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:39,389
or do we recommend using

870
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,350
mamba these days in

871
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,992
the installation instructions then it

872
00:35:41,992 --> 00:35:44,495
would be mamba activate yes I don't know

873
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:45,797
if source activate will work

874
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:49,181
for everyone but in some cases yeah

875
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,142
because of the structure I'm

876
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:52,785
always like yeah exactly but yeah

877
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:53,947
but mamba activate or

878
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,129
either source activate then name

879
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:56,830
of the environment so it

880
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,192
would activate the environment and

881
00:35:58,192 --> 00:36:00,094
then I can run the command

882
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:04,860
JupyterLab to to run the JupyterLab

883
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,476
So what happens is that

884
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:12,586
JupyterLab would be starting and

885
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,595
in your recent browser, it would

886
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:17,120
open a new tab or new window

887
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,187
and it would show the interface.

888
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,223
so let's wait for it so

889
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,806
it would be done yes and

890
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,970
it switched to my browser so you can see

891
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,713
that the interface of the

892
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:30,859
computer lab is starting which is very good

893
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:32,883
but ... for a second if I

894
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:35,408
go back to the previous ...

895
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,033
terminal if you look at the

896
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:40,818
logs here you can see that

897
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:42,501
The JupyterLab is starting

898
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,564
at my localhost with this specific port.

899
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:46,086
The port and the address

900
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:47,769
can be also changed.

901
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:50,413
And there is also this token thing.

902
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:51,716
So if you want to open it

903
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,078
in a new browser or like

904
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,500
when sometimes you're working on

905
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,742
a remote server and you're

906
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:57,024
doing like port forwarding to

907
00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:59,268
run a Jupyter notebook, it's

908
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:00,890
always good to have this token.

909
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,593
Otherwise, Jupyter doesn't allow you

910
00:37:02,593 --> 00:37:03,835
to log in.

911
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,179
So just to, I don't think

912
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:09,725
I can, it's just to demonstrate.

913
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,508
At least copying and pasting

914
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:13,671
that full URL should work.

915
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:14,733
I don't know if you can.

916
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,095
Exactly, yes.

917
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:16,736
From the terminal.

918
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,018
But on some terminals, just

919
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,647
clicking on it is enough.

920
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:20,688
Yeah.

921
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:20,868
OK.

922
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,431
So maybe we can talk about

923
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,373
the interface a bit.

924
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:31,038
So this is one of the, actually,

925
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:32,280
before that, maybe I can go

926
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,162
back to the course and

927
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:35,783
talk about the components and

928
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:36,884
the big picture behind it.

929
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:39,407
So what's happening behind the

930
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,068
scene is that we have

931
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:45,133
the Jupyter Notebook server running,

932
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,575
which in this case is the JupyterLab.

933
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:49,718
And inside the JupyterLab, we

934
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:51,740
are creating notebook files just

935
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,404
to see the interface and see

936
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:56,126
all of the cells and the segments of the code.

937
00:37:57,428 --> 00:37:58,209
At the moment, we are

938
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,333
using my Chrome browser to

939
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:04,938
see the Jupyter, interact with the JupyterLab.

940
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:06,540
But it can be also VS

941
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,884
Code or any other tools, I guess.

942
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:12,989
And behind the scenes, there

943
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,633
is a kernel running, which can be thought

944
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:17,115
as like a virtual environment,

945
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:18,838
which has all of your dependencies

946
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,403
and also the dependencies for Jupyter,

947
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:23,385
which is like the

948
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,568
IPython kernel, essentially, to run

949
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:26,629
the code and show you the

950
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:28,332
output and also render the markdown.

951
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,271
So the kernel runs the code.

952
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:32,592
The notebook file is where

953
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:34,474
you essentially save everything

954
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:36,596
and the browser just shows things.

955
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:37,017
Exactly.

956
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,200
So now we have an understanding

957
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,441
of the big picture.

958
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:44,104
Maybe I can go back to the, oh, no.

959
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:48,268
Maybe I can go back to the, oh, sorry.

960
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:51,431
Maybe I can go back to the interface.

961
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,253
And the reason is I don't

962
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:55,095
see the tab names, but yeah.

963
00:38:56,307 --> 00:38:59,131
So this is the JupyterLab interface,

964
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:02,135
and here you can create

965
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:05,520
a new notebook, which would take a look in.

966
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,002
You can also create a

967
00:39:07,002 --> 00:39:08,263
console with IPython that you

968
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,526
can test some small commands.

969
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:11,748
You can open a terminal here,

970
00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:14,632
create a file with markdown text.

971
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,937
And before creating a notebook,

972
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:20,760
maybe we can look at what

973
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,683
is the interface here.

974
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,405
... so here in the tree

975
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,946
explorer you would see all of

976
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,847
the name of the file that

977
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,168
has been created the folder is

978
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:29,589
empty I just created that so

979
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:31,211
there is nothing here inside

980
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,674
yet this blue button would open

981
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:36,295
a new launcher launcher is

982
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:38,097
this specific page so if I

983
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:40,339
create this another tab would

984
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:41,981
be created here that is

985
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:44,403
essentially the same one ... so

986
00:39:44,403 --> 00:39:45,564
for now it's not useful but

987
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:47,485
when you're editing a notebook

988
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,566
and you're on the launcher again

989
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,248
that would be a useful button so

990
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:52,450
for now I will close this tab

991
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,873
I can create a new folder here.

992
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,896
I can upload a new file.

993
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,740
Or if I change the folder

994
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:01,762
in like my terminal or

995
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:03,905
something and this hasn't been

996
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,609
updated, I can refresh this file explorer.

997
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:09,953
I can, of course, clone

998
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:11,475
a Git repository and I can

999
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,498
like filter some of the files

1000
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:15,240
with like some names or like

1001
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,625
essentially like a search button.

1002
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,247
I guess we'll take a look at the

1003
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:24,799
Well, okay, the side panels are useful.

1004
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,560
Like, we'll take a look at

1005
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,843
the Git part at some point later.

1006
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:30,787
Yeah.

1007
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,630
There is maybe, like, this

1008
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,973
circle with the square inside.

1009
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:35,734
Yes.

1010
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,739
So this is for the kernels.

1011
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,280
Yes.

1012
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,002
At the moment, there is no kernel running,

1013
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:43,385
so I haven't, like, started

1014
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:45,569
any kernel, which, again, you can

1015
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,331
think of it as, like, a...

1016
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,377
Yeah, but this is kind of

1017
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:50,478
just good to know, and you

1018
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:52,601
probably will not need it today

1019
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,384
or any time very soon.

1020
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:56,366
Exactly.

1021
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:57,388
But when you have

1022
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,132
multiple notebooks running, you can, like,

1023
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:01,834
restart the kernel, which is, like,

1024
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,677
reinstall the memory of

1025
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,940
the Python interpreter or the

1026
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,183
R interpreter, in a sense.

1027
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:11,968
But then I think... Mm-hmm.

1028
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:15,230
Yeah, so I'm just thinking through

1029
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,593
what we'll actually need for the exercise,

1030
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:18,955
and I think that is creating

1031
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:23,261
a file and adding cells.

1032
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:26,406
Okay, so just the last one is

1033
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:30,131
that with the Git, one,

1034
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:32,154
you can actually clone a Git

1035
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:33,396
repository, or you can actually

1036
00:41:33,396 --> 00:41:35,279
initialize a Git repository here.

1037
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:37,262
As we mentioned, notebooks can

1038
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:40,366
be version controlled, but

1039
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:42,008
there are like some tricks

1040
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:43,469
that [name] would show.

1041
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:44,911
So let me just initialize,

1042
00:41:44,911 --> 00:41:46,733
I'll just get repository here so

1043
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:50,156
you can like, yes, so that's good.

1044
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:51,518
So maybe I can go back

1045
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:54,080
to the main folder here and then

1046
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,642
I can create a new notebook.

1047
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:57,744
So as you can see, a

1048
00:41:57,744 --> 00:41:59,866
new notebook has been created and

1049
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:01,929
this is my file and always

1050
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:03,771
remember to rename the file first.

1051
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,693
So I would right click on

1052
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:09,998
this and rename it to intro.

1053
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:12,086
Also, you can use the shortcuts

1054
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:13,672
as well, but don't push

1055
00:42:13,672 --> 00:42:16,141
yourself to learn all of the shortcuts.

1056
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:18,490
Using Vitek GUI is also fine.

1057
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,842
So, sorry, I created a mistake.

1058
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,905
So in the Jupyter Notebook, as

1059
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:28,909
you can see, we have these

1060
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:30,070
sections called a cell.

1061
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,575
And in this cell, you

1062
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:35,818
can, for example, write any code.

1063
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:37,240
For example, I would go ahead

1064
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,726
and from date and time, I

1065
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,611
would import date and time,

1066
00:42:45,611 --> 00:42:49,638
and for example, print date and time.

1067
00:42:49,638 --> 00:42:53,183
you now see what is the time and ...

1068
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:54,245
when I'm selecting a file

1069
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:56,188
this blue indicator shows that

1070
00:42:56,188 --> 00:43:00,054
this specific cell is selected so

1071
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:01,997
I can go ahead and with this

1072
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,860
play button I can go ahead and run it

1073
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,825
so you can see that the code

1074
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:09,709
is run at the moment ... by

1075
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:12,273
the way can people see well

1076
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:13,855
is the text large enough ... you

1077
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:14,937
can write in the notes if it's not

1078
00:43:16,216 --> 00:43:17,880
Yes, but I can also increase

1079
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,283
the font a bit.

1080
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:20,305
Is it better?

1081
00:43:20,305 --> 00:43:20,887
A bit, yeah.

1082
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:22,591
But I can also.

1083
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:25,417
I mean, also, if it's fine, then it's fine.

1084
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:26,620
Okay.

1085
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,201
Okay.

1086
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:28,765
I would keep it at this so

1087
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:30,429
we can see all of the buttons as well.

1088
00:43:30,429 --> 00:43:30,965
Yeah.

1089
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:32,768
So when you are selecting a

1090
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:36,673
cell, the first button would

1091
00:43:36,673 --> 00:43:40,258
save the whole notebook and

1092
00:43:40,258 --> 00:43:41,780
also create the checkpoints, like

1093
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,382
a backup that you can go back into it.

1094
00:43:44,444 --> 00:43:45,986
You can add a new cell

1095
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,122
below the cell that has been

1096
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:50,987
select it, you can cut a cell

1097
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:52,189
and like paste it somewhere

1098
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:53,874
else to the code that you, if you want,

1099
00:43:53,874 --> 00:43:55,578
you can copy a cell, you

1100
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:58,365
can paste a cell, of course, you can run a cell.

1101
00:43:58,365 --> 00:43:59,447
And if it's a code one,

1102
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:00,991
it would run the code.

1103
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:02,214
And if it's a Markdown one,

1104
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:05,963
it would just render the Markdown.

1105
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:07,605
and this guy is for

1106
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:09,326
interrupting the kernel and it means

1107
00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:11,028
that let's say you have

1108
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:12,890
a computationally heavy function

1109
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,771
or like when you're

1110
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:15,152
doing something computationally heavy

1111
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,674
heavy and the code is a

1112
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:17,895
stock you can just interrupt it

1113
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:20,258
so the the computation would pause

1114
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:21,659
and the command is not

1115
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,143
run completely you can restart the kernel

1116
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:28,086
and also run and if you want

1117
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:29,727
to run some of the some of

1118
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:32,951
the cells again or you can

1119
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:35,413
restart the kernel and run all of the cells

1120
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,025
So just to show you, I

1121
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:39,748
would select another cell.

1122
00:44:39,748 --> 00:44:40,950
And when I'm selecting a

1123
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,572
cell, there is also this button

1124
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:45,556
that it shows what is the cell type.

1125
00:44:45,556 --> 00:44:48,220
At the moment, by default, is a code one.

1126
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,682
I can go ahead and, for

1127
00:44:49,682 --> 00:44:51,084
example, change it to Markdown.

1128
00:44:51,084 --> 00:44:53,969
And when it's Markdown, I

1129
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:55,531
can write anything in Markdown.

1130
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,073
So for example, I can say

1131
00:44:57,073 --> 00:44:59,697
this is a large heading.

1132
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:05,339
And, ... for example, ... sorry,

1133
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:09,243
this is a second heading and,

1134
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:13,228
... this is a normal text.

1135
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,871
... or I can like,

1136
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:19,875
for example, writing bold, bold, a bold text,

1137
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,377
or I can write, for

1138
00:45:21,377 --> 00:45:23,519
example, equations as well, like X

1139
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,705
equals to, I don't know, Sigma_i.

1140
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,835
or y to the power of i, let's say, plus 1.

1141
00:45:37,078 --> 00:45:38,820
And I can go ahead and run this.

1142
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,001
And because it's a markdown,

1143
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:42,123
it will just render the markdown.

1144
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:43,125
So there is a heading,

1145
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,427
the second heading, and the normal text.

1146
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:50,874
So rendering means showing what

1147
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,496
you mean by this syntax, right?

1148
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:53,076
Exactly.

1149
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:54,478
It's like the view mode.

1150
00:45:54,478 --> 00:45:57,153
Exactly, like the view mode for that, yeah.

1151
00:45:57,153 --> 00:45:58,896
... so now you can see like

1152
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:00,399
why it can be powerful because

1153
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:01,821
you can like add the equations

1154
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:03,123
that you want to do before,

1155
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:04,946
like doing like the coding.

1156
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:06,329
And then when someone is

1157
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:09,174
following the code or your Jupyter notebook,

1158
00:46:09,174 --> 00:46:10,015
they can see what are

1159
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:11,297
the equations and they don't

1160
00:46:11,297 --> 00:46:12,840
have to like finding the code.

1161
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:14,723
...

1162
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:16,198
Yes.

1163
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,500
Okay.

1164
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,982
If I go back, actually

1165
00:46:19,982 --> 00:46:22,104
another, maybe something else that

1166
00:46:22,104 --> 00:46:24,125
it can be useful here is

1167
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:28,589
this third button on the left, on the sidebar,

1168
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:29,971
which is just a table of

1169
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:30,972
content, as I mentioned, like

1170
00:46:30,972 --> 00:46:32,413
there are some books entirely

1171
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:33,254
written in Jupyter.

1172
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:35,456
So it would just show the heading

1173
00:46:35,456 --> 00:46:36,557
so you can see, and then

1174
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:37,778
when you click on the, for

1175
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:38,779
example, the second heading, it

1176
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,961
would directly go that side.

1177
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:42,142
I've never actually used this,

1178
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:42,983
but I can see if you're

1179
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:44,444
writing a full book in Jupyter,

1180
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:46,360
then this will be useful.

1181
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,962
Also for doing some assignments,

1182
00:46:47,962 --> 00:46:49,925
I would say this is very useful.

1183
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:51,167
But yeah, OK.

1184
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,970
Anything, [illegible].

1185
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,933
So yeah, I guess now you

1186
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:56,235
have a better idea.

1187
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:57,978
And now you understand the

1188
00:46:57,978 --> 00:46:59,821
interface, at least the JupyterLab,

1189
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:00,422
a bit better.

1190
00:47:00,422 --> 00:47:03,546
So if I go back to the course page,

1191
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:05,690
I guess we covered the

1192
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,922
navigation and what are the buttons.

1193
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:11,866
And I guess people can

1194
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:13,248
learn the shortcuts and so on

1195
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,211
if they end up using JupyterLab more.

1196
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:16,894
I guess this is something

1197
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:19,437
that you would eventually learn,

1198
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,879
but don't push yourself.

1199
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,663
And also, if you prefer

1200
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:24,885
a different interface, then this

1201
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,067
is completely useless.

1202
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:27,529
that's true so maybe actually

1203
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:28,910
I can also use like I can

1204
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,494
show very briefly the VS Code as well

1205
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:33,256
so as I mentioned at the

1206
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:36,480
at the moment ... we are using JupyterLab

1207
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,382
as the notebook server and like

1208
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:40,224
... we are using the browser

1209
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:42,567
to interact with and create notebooks

1210
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:43,608
and everything but this can be

1211
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:46,351
done also in other tools ...

1212
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:48,073
for example like in an IDE like

1213
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,596
VS Code so if I open my

1214
00:47:50,596 --> 00:47:53,240
VS Code here, so my VS Code is

1215
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,003
this like I hope you can see it

1216
00:47:56,003 --> 00:47:58,688
I would close this error for now.

1217
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,193
Maybe I can increase the font a bit.

1218
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:01,374
Yes.

1219
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:03,818
So I'm inside the Jupyter demo

1220
00:48:03,818 --> 00:48:07,205
lab and this is the intro file that we created.

1221
00:48:07,205 --> 00:48:09,329
And as you can see, again,

1222
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:11,313
I can like create a new code

1223
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:14,440
cell or I can create a new markdown cell here.

1224
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,203
So the interface is a bit different.

1225
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:17,726
but you have the understanding

1226
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:20,010
of what is the code cell and the markdown cell.

1227
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,873
And for example, I can go

1228
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,618
ahead and try to run a cell as well.

1229
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:26,722
But in VS Code, it's capable

1230
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:31,530
to show you the notebook, but to

1231
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,493
be able to run the code or

1232
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,018
the markdown codes to do the

1233
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:38,883
rendering, you need an additional...

1234
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:41,106
... plugin but if I go

1235
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:42,748
ahead and I actually I guess

1236
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:45,131
I have the plugin already installed

1237
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,295
so maybe I can show you so if you

1238
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:49,157
if you don't have the

1239
00:48:49,157 --> 00:48:50,518
plugin installed you have to go

1240
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:52,261
here to the plugin tab

1241
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:55,425
the extensions example search for

1242
00:48:55,425 --> 00:48:59,230
repeater the reason that it

1243
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,613
has been installed is that

1244
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:03,335
actually it wasn't installed but

1245
00:49:03,335 --> 00:49:06,579
it wasn't ... it wasn't really

1246
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,768
all right you removed it but didn't update

1247
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:10,651
Yes, I didn't close the VS Code.

1248
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:12,033
Yeah, that was the reason.

1249
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,977
And the reason is that, so

1250
00:49:13,977 --> 00:49:15,599
this is the Jupyter plugin.

1251
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,501
And at the moment with

1252
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:17,643
the latest version of VS

1253
00:49:17,643 --> 00:49:19,486
Code, the latest version of

1254
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:21,289
Jupyter, which has been updated

1255
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,353
two weeks ago, doesn't work.

1256
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:25,997
So in order to be able

1257
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,580
to use the Jupyter plugin with

1258
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,523
the latest VS Code version, you

1259
00:49:29,523 --> 00:49:32,548
have to install a previous

1260
00:49:32,548 --> 00:49:34,371
version of Jupyter extension.

1261
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,610
So if you haven't updated your VS Code,

1262
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,952
go ahead and click on install

1263
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:39,994
so you can install the

1264
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:42,237
latest version of Jupyter extension.

1265
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:45,342
And if you recently updated the VS Code,

1266
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:46,504
you have to install the

1267
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:48,747
previous version of Jupyter.

1268
00:49:48,747 --> 00:49:50,489
So to do that, you have

1269
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,252
this setting button here.

1270
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:54,355
So you would go here and

1271
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:56,238
then go with the...

1272
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:58,603
and install a specific version

1273
00:49:58,603 --> 00:50:03,654
and the 2025.7 for a month

1274
00:50:03,654 --> 00:50:05,939
of july would ... would work I

1275
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:07,823
think I I used the one from three weeks ago

1276
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:09,586
and that also worked it's

1277
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:11,711
just the most recent work maybe

1278
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:13,094
okay well then it's better to

1279
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,176
go with the two months ago

1280
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:16,541
OK, but maybe before

1281
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:18,485
installing it completely, I can go

1282
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:21,451
back to the code and show you what happens

1283
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,473
if you try to install it

1284
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:24,617
without to run the Jupyter

1285
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:26,280
notebook without the extension.

1286
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,505
So if I go back here and

1287
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:33,194
if I try to, for example, run this Python code.

1288
00:50:33,194 --> 00:50:35,679
... it would suggest that this

1289
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,482
is a Jupyter one and it

1290
00:50:37,482 --> 00:50:39,105
does it it's not allowed it

1291
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:40,948
cannot run it without the extension

1292
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:41,810
I do I don't use

1293
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,112
the recommended version because it

1294
00:50:43,112 --> 00:50:44,675
would just install the latest

1295
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:45,977
version so I would cancel this

1296
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:49,023
go back to extension and

1297
00:50:49,023 --> 00:50:50,646
then install the previous version

1298
00:50:52,972 --> 00:50:55,295
so it's good that I installed it

1299
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:56,817
before so it's already cached

1300
00:50:56,817 --> 00:51:00,482
I guess great so if I close

1301
00:51:00,482 --> 00:51:04,748
this and I now I try to run this it would ask

1302
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:07,412
for the python kernel in which

1303
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:08,854
I can use the code to find the one

1304
00:51:08,854 --> 00:51:09,675
that I created in my

1305
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:13,400
conda environment and now I should

1306
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,922
be able to run this guy

1307
00:51:14,922 --> 00:51:17,325
it's looking at the connecting to the kernel

1308
00:51:19,128 --> 00:51:22,432
And hopefully this should change.

1309
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:24,915
It's a bit long for the

1310
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,198
first time to starting the kernel,

1311
00:51:27,198 --> 00:51:30,382
but then it should be fine.

1312
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:31,464
It should work.

1313
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:32,545
It usually does, but this

1314
00:51:32,545 --> 00:51:33,246
is taking a while.

1315
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:37,431
Yes, let's see.

1316
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,172
Oh, well, I mean, we

1317
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:39,714
already saw it running.

1318
00:51:39,714 --> 00:51:42,118
Should we just go to the exercise?

1319
00:51:42,118 --> 00:51:43,820
Oh, well, actually it's done.

1320
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,761
This is already done.

1321
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,642
So yeah, that's good.

1322
00:51:47,326 --> 00:51:47,686
Okay.

1323
00:51:48,948 --> 00:51:50,729
I guess you're a bit behind

1324
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:52,071
the time, but yeah, we can go a bit.

1325
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:53,732
I mean, it's fine.

1326
00:51:53,732 --> 00:51:55,714
We actually do have some extra time.

1327
00:51:55,714 --> 00:51:56,455
Okay.

1328
00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:57,616
So that's good.

1329
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,498
So the next part is for

1330
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:01,500
you to start working and

1331
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,721
getting some hands-on experience

1332
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:05,083
with the Jupyter Notebooks.

1333
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,204
So this would be your

1334
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:07,586
first computational notebook.

1335
00:52:08,406 --> 00:52:10,388
And in this exercise, you

1336
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:13,832
are going to calculate the pi.

1337
00:52:15,253 --> 00:52:16,354
And...

1338
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:20,255
In order to do that, we

1339
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:22,519
are creating a square, like a

1340
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:23,862
one by one square, and then

1341
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:27,068
we are randomly throwing some darts into it.

1342
00:52:27,068 --> 00:52:28,491
And then by calculating the

1343
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,815
area of the circle and also

1344
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:33,239
the area of the square, we

1345
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:35,183
are trying to estimate

1346
00:52:35,183 --> 00:52:37,327
... the pi ... of course

1347
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:40,413
if you throw more dots ...

1348
00:52:40,413 --> 00:52:42,276
if you throw like infinity number

1349
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,641
of dots the whole score should be covered

1350
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:46,063
so the pi should be more

1351
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:48,608
accurate so that's the whole

1352
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,133
idea behind this exercise I guess

1353
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:54,238
So I guess maybe we can

1354
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,283
have 20 minutes or 15 minutes

1355
00:52:56,283 --> 00:52:57,205
to do the exercise.

1356
00:52:57,205 --> 00:53:00,493
Do you want to show the hint below?

1357
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:01,656
Yes, exactly.

1358
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,440
So go ahead and run the

1359
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,105
JupyterLab on your time.

1360
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:09,254
But actually, there is a very useful

1361
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:11,958
int here so if I go

1362
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:16,585
back to my Jupyter notebook a JupyterLab

1363
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:19,149
and I would ... start a new launcher

1364
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:20,110
because I want to create a

1365
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,412
new file here I would start

1366
00:53:21,412 --> 00:53:23,515
the launcher I would create a

1367
00:53:23,515 --> 00:53:25,898
new notebook here always remember

1368
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:28,823
to rename your notebook first I

1369
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:31,006
would name it to pi

1370
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:34,113
And in the exercise, we

1371
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:37,079
have this code block that you can copy.

1372
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,382
And essentially what it does,

1373
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,586
it would create an iframe and

1374
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:42,711
show you this whole page

1375
00:53:42,711 --> 00:53:43,853
inside the Jupyter Notebook.

1376
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:46,840
So if I will go here and

1377
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,323
copy and paste the code.

1378
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:53,212
And I would run this block of code.

1379
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:54,994
And as you can see, you

1380
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:58,079
see that powerful point of the

1381
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,583
Jupyter that I can render HTML5 here directly.

1382
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:02,925
So if you want to follow

1383
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:04,087
the exercise, you don't have

1384
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,328
to switch the tabs.

1385
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:06,450
You can just scroll here

1386
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,372
and follow the exercise very easily.

1387
00:54:12,378 --> 00:54:13,299
OK.

1388
00:54:15,782 --> 00:54:17,905
Maybe we can add.

1389
00:54:18,712 --> 00:54:19,975
I mean, I think the

1390
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:21,177
instructions are pretty clear.

1391
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:24,444
It's mainly you create a notebook

1392
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:27,030
and then you need to figure out

1393
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,854
how to get a Markdown cell and

1394
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:31,317
how to get a Python code cell.

1395
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:35,402
and then copy and paste

1396
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,424
the things inside and see how it runs.

1397
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:38,425
So this is more about

1398
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:40,267
the interface than writing the code.

1399
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:41,689
The idea is not that you write the code.

1400
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:42,650
The idea is that you

1401
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:48,977
create the notebook and put the stuff inside.

1402
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:52,762
And if something went wrong,

1403
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:53,923
you can ask the question and

1404
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,305
we are here to help.

1405
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:57,267
So yeah, maybe we can

1406
00:54:57,267 --> 00:54:59,785
set 15 minutes, [name], or...

1407
00:54:59,785 --> 00:55:03,028
I mean, this actually, like

1408
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:04,270
if there's any problems, then it

1409
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:04,910
will take a while.

1410
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,372
So I would go with 20 minutes.

1411
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:08,454
20 minutes.

1412
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:13,359
Or let's say until the hour.

1413
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,620
So it's 19 minutes now.

1414
00:55:16,302 --> 00:55:16,602
Okay.

1415
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:19,445
Good luck with the exercise.

1416
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,947
And remember, you can ask

1417
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:22,908
questions in the notebooks.

1418
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:27,224
Not in the notebook, in the...

1419
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,466
in the notes, in this

1420
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:30,629
Markdown notes that we have.

1421
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:34,334
You probably can ask questions

1422
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:35,676
in a Jupyter Notebook as well

1423
00:55:35,676 --> 00:55:37,679
and get answers, but that's

1424
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:38,461
way more complicated.

1425
00:55:39,362 --> 00:55:41,044
But in the sharing discussion,

1426
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:42,527
we would like to discuss it.

1427
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:45,731
It would be possible.

1428
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:46,212
Great.

1429
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:47,153
Good luck with the exercise.

1430
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:49,477
All right.

1431
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:49,637
Bye.

1432
01:13:33,637 --> 01:13:33,958
Hello.

1433
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:36,682
Are we live?

1434
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:41,671
I think we are.

1435
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:43,334
And you should be seeing

1436
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:44,977
my screen share now.

1437
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:47,061
So I actually scrolled up

1438
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:48,343
earlier, but then I scrolled back

1439
01:13:48,343 --> 01:13:49,605
down for some reason.

1440
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:50,507
Yeah.

1441
01:13:50,507 --> 01:13:51,589
So I was meant to show

1442
01:13:51,589 --> 01:13:53,131
this picture, which is a good

1443
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:55,676
thing to start with.

1444
01:13:55,676 --> 01:13:57,717
Okay.

1445
01:13:57,717 --> 01:13:59,338
A number of you have done

1446
01:13:59,338 --> 01:14:00,680
with the exercise and nobody else

1447
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,842
voted for any of the other options.

1448
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:05,804
So I assume it went relatively well,

1449
01:14:05,804 --> 01:14:07,225
but feel free to ask

1450
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:10,568
any further questions if you had any problems.

1451
01:14:11,589 --> 01:14:14,172
So I'll essentially do the

1452
01:14:14,172 --> 01:14:15,072
exercise here quickly.

1453
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:17,835
So I'm using the JupyterLab

1454
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:20,737
interface we already showed and

1455
01:14:20,737 --> 01:14:22,619
using exactly the same features

1456
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:24,100
that we already showed.

1457
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:24,841
Whoops.

1458
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:25,642
What is happening?

1459
01:14:25,642 --> 01:14:26,422
Okay.

1460
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:28,825
To save the file, I need to click here,

1461
01:14:28,825 --> 01:14:30,407
not press Control and S,

1462
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:31,609
because Control and S will try

1463
01:14:31,609 --> 01:14:32,430
to save the website.

1464
01:14:33,451 --> 01:14:34,673
So, okay.

1465
01:14:36,395 --> 01:14:39,459
So I have this file called Python Notebook.

1466
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:42,423
And I'll just hide this part

1467
01:14:42,423 --> 01:14:44,365
of the view, maybe zoom in a little bit.

1468
01:14:46,628 --> 01:14:47,970
And then let's scroll down.

1469
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,773
So I have already started JupyterLab.

1470
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:52,756
Well, I don't need to do that one.

1471
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:55,767
I want to use this browser.

1472
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:56,828
And then I have done

1473
01:14:56,828 --> 01:14:58,690
this, shown this webpage here.

1474
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,891
So going into the exercise

1475
01:15:00,891 --> 01:15:04,254
itself, let's make a new cell first.

1476
01:15:05,856 --> 01:15:07,497
And I need to turn this

1477
01:15:07,497 --> 01:15:08,578
cell into a Markdown cell.

1478
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:08,978
Okay.

1479
01:15:08,978 --> 01:15:12,401
So it's, I am partly

1480
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:14,743
using this interface because it's not

1481
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,145
the one I normally use and

1482
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:17,566
I don't know where things are.

1483
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:19,728
So I will have to also

1484
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:21,990
remember to explain what's happening.

1485
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,350
Okay.

1486
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:23,751
So run the Markdown cell and

1487
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:25,298
we get nice title.

1488
01:15:25,298 --> 01:15:26,639
and we can paste in

1489
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:29,983
some interesting formulas that explain

1490
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:30,784
what we are doing.

1491
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,749
So this is how we calculate the area of,

1492
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:38,512
how we calculate pi from the

1493
01:15:38,512 --> 01:15:42,457
area of a circle and the area of a square.

1494
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:45,740
And those are relative to

1495
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,602
the probabilities of hitting,

1496
01:15:47,602 --> 01:15:48,964
well, the probability of hitting

1497
01:15:48,964 --> 01:15:50,766
the square is one, but

1498
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:51,747
the probability of hitting the

1499
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:55,572
circle is relative to the,

1500
01:15:55,572 --> 01:15:59,116
area of that circle okay so

1501
01:15:59,116 --> 01:16:01,198
then ... we have one more thing

1502
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:05,362
we have the nice image ... I

1503
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:07,024
did not change it into a markdown cell

1504
01:16:07,024 --> 01:16:08,686
and this is not proper python code

1505
01:16:08,686 --> 01:16:10,988
so it's failing to run it

1506
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:13,471
let's change it to markdown and run it

1507
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:14,472
and by the way ...

1508
01:16:14,472 --> 01:16:16,054
now I'm already defaulting to

1509
01:16:16,054 --> 01:16:17,755
running it by pressing ctrl and

1510
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:20,378
enter so next time I will press

1511
01:16:20,378 --> 01:16:24,310
here but it is the same thing

1512
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,693
So the first thing is we

1513
01:16:25,693 --> 01:16:26,716
need to import the random

1514
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:28,500
module and the plotting module

1515
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,342
to create the plots.

1516
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:31,988
So let's create a new cell again.

1517
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:34,193
And now it's code, so I

1518
01:16:34,193 --> 01:16:34,935
don't have to change it.

1519
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:36,679
Okay.

1520
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:38,303
And this is Python code specifically.

1521
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:40,949
Okay.

1522
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:44,754
I'm confused about what

1523
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:46,657
I'm scrolling because it's the same website.

1524
01:16:46,657 --> 01:16:47,758
It's a website in a website.

1525
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,100
Okay.

1526
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,482
So we'll set number of points.

1527
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:51,984
Let's also take the comment.

1528
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:52,345
Why not?

1529
01:16:53,787 --> 01:16:54,067
Okay.

1530
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:56,911
Setting the number of points to 1000.

1531
01:16:56,911 --> 01:17:00,055
I think at this point I

1532
01:17:00,055 --> 01:17:01,417
will not be scrolling up and down.

1533
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,220
I'll just look at the window

1534
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:08,307
on the side, which you do not see.

1535
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:13,211
So I'm here.

1536
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,516
So we'll create this or run.

1537
01:17:15,516 --> 01:17:19,824
Add the code to actually

1538
01:17:19,824 --> 01:17:21,668
create these random points and see

1539
01:17:21,668 --> 01:17:23,291
if they are inside the circle.

1540
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:25,435
And run it.

1541
01:17:26,737 --> 01:17:27,920
Okay, that didn't take very long.

1542
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:32,368
Then this one creates the plot.

1543
01:17:32,368 --> 01:17:33,920
So it takes all of these

1544
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,123
coordinates and puts them,

1545
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,484
makes them visible on the, or

1546
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:38,385
draws them onto the plot.

1547
01:17:39,366 --> 01:17:40,588
Let's run that.

1548
01:17:40,588 --> 01:17:42,230
So here is the nice little plot.

1549
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:46,715
And it's only a quarter of the circle,

1550
01:17:46,715 --> 01:17:49,318
or quarter of the whole

1551
01:17:49,318 --> 01:17:51,160
dartboard here, but it is this

1552
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,061
quarter that we show here.

1553
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:53,803
Okay.

1554
01:17:55,365 --> 01:17:56,206
And finally this one.

1555
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:00,431
So we compute pi by getting

1556
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:04,109
the fraction of the two areas, or the

1557
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:05,871
estimate of the fraction and

1558
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:07,734
then multiply that by four to get pi.

1559
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:09,897
So here we go.

1560
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,341
And that's not exactly pi,

1561
01:18:12,341 --> 01:18:13,422
but it's also not the

1562
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,146
furthest possible thing away.

1563
01:18:16,146 --> 01:18:19,651
So let's run this again, change

1564
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:23,937
add a few more points just to

1565
01:18:23,937 --> 01:18:25,239
see if we get a more accurate way.

1566
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:27,402
Still doesn't take you very long,

1567
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:28,443
but this is starting to

1568
01:18:28,443 --> 01:18:31,348
look like it's basically completely covered.

1569
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:33,674
Okay.

1570
01:18:33,674 --> 01:18:35,457
and also pi is a little bit closer.

1571
01:18:36,298 --> 01:18:38,561
Now I'm going to change that,

1572
01:18:38,561 --> 01:18:39,563
and then I'm going to talk

1573
01:18:39,563 --> 01:18:41,225
to you a little bit about something.

1574
01:18:41,225 --> 01:18:42,407
I don't actually know what.

1575
01:18:43,369 --> 01:18:47,395
And then I'm going to go, okay, run this.

1576
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:48,657
Wait.

1577
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:53,845
The mistake I was trying to

1578
01:18:53,845 --> 01:18:55,347
make, it didn't happen.

1579
01:18:55,347 --> 01:18:56,629
Okay.

1580
01:18:56,629 --> 01:18:58,351
Now, this is not pi.

1581
01:18:59,493 --> 01:18:59,773
Okay.

1582
01:19:00,595 --> 01:19:01,383
So,

1583
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:02,625
This is probably the most

1584
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,026
common mistake anybody makes

1585
01:19:04,026 --> 01:19:07,351
with Jupyter notebooks, right?

1586
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:08,893
So what did I do wrong?

1587
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:13,279
I changed the number of points,

1588
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,422
but then I didn't run

1589
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,686
this cell that generates the points.

1590
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:26,020
I didn't refresh the plot either, but then

1591
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:27,842
This depends on the number of

1592
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:29,224
hits and the number of points.

1593
01:19:29,224 --> 01:19:30,045
So I changed the number of

1594
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:31,587
points, but I didn't recreate

1595
01:19:31,587 --> 01:19:33,189
this number of hits.

1596
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:34,371
So the result is wrong.

1597
01:19:35,452 --> 01:19:38,096
My solution is interrupt the

1598
01:19:38,096 --> 01:19:39,678
kernel, press stop.

1599
01:19:40,639 --> 01:19:42,221
Did it do it?

1600
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:43,043
Okay.

1601
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:44,204
Maybe it did.

1602
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:44,645
Okay.

1603
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:46,527
And then restart the kernel

1604
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:47,328
and run all cells.

1605
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:49,291
And then you can be sure

1606
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:51,814
that everything is running in order.

1607
01:19:54,678 --> 01:19:54,778
Okay.

1608
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:58,566
there we are I made it a lot of dots

1609
01:19:58,566 --> 01:19:59,687
so it took a while but

1610
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:02,730
well it's still not great this

1611
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,293
is it it's like close ish

1612
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:10,959
but not cool yeah anyway ... so yeah

1613
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:12,301
that is a common mistake

1614
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:13,462
I'm gonna change it back to

1615
01:20:13,462 --> 01:20:17,266
the original and ... again run

1616
01:20:17,266 --> 01:20:21,070
all cells restart and run all cells yeah so

1617
01:20:22,383 --> 01:20:24,206
Yeah, so I just wanted to show

1618
01:20:24,206 --> 01:20:26,268
that because it is essentially

1619
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:27,730
the most common mistake people make.

1620
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:30,094
And it is something that I

1621
01:20:30,094 --> 01:20:31,095
really had to learn out of.

1622
01:20:33,218 --> 01:20:34,880
But it is also a powerful

1623
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,603
thing that you can run things out of order.

1624
01:20:36,603 --> 01:20:38,686
So you can use it as a scratch pad.

1625
01:20:38,686 --> 01:20:39,707
You don't always have to

1626
01:20:39,707 --> 01:20:42,150
run the whole thing to get

1627
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,175
the result or to change one thing.

1628
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,830
But it doesn't remember what the state of

1629
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,392
The notebook was after running

1630
01:20:53,392 --> 01:20:55,835
cell number three, just remembers

1631
01:20:55,835 --> 01:20:56,616
the current state.

1632
01:20:56,616 --> 01:20:57,678
And if you change something,

1633
01:20:57,678 --> 01:20:59,520
run some code, it changes the current state.

1634
01:21:00,842 --> 01:21:02,244
Okay.

1635
01:21:02,244 --> 01:21:03,806
So yeah, that is a bit

1636
01:21:03,806 --> 01:21:05,268
of a complicated thing.

1637
01:21:05,268 --> 01:21:06,970
It can be hard to debug,

1638
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:11,336
but the simplest way to get around it

1639
01:21:11,336 --> 01:21:13,940
and avoid debugging it is to

1640
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,502
just kill the kernel and

1641
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:17,044
then run everything from the

1642
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:17,645
beginning to the end.

1643
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:19,948
Yeah.

1644
01:21:19,948 --> 01:21:20,048
Yeah.

1645
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:21,964
Okay, but that was the

1646
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:24,007
exercise and also it's time for a break.

1647
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:27,534
So let's take a 10 minute

1648
01:21:27,534 --> 01:21:34,446
break and see you back here at 18 past the hour.

1649
01:21:35,928 --> 01:21:37,851
Yeah, that's all.

1650
01:21:39,034 --> 01:21:40,977
Take a walk, stretch your

1651
01:21:40,977 --> 01:21:44,403
legs, get some coffee and see you soon.

1652
01:21:44,403 --> 01:21:44,483
Bye.

1653
01:31:40,066 --> 01:31:41,688
I hope you had a good break.

1654
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,572
So I'm, okay, I'm still on

1655
01:31:46,572 --> 01:31:48,654
the same page with the exercise.

1656
01:31:49,815 --> 01:31:56,462
And we actually have, we

1657
01:31:56,462 --> 01:31:57,743
have a full notebook here in

1658
01:31:57,743 --> 01:31:59,224
case you are joining us now,

1659
01:32:00,245 --> 01:32:02,508
or you were installing the

1660
01:32:02,508 --> 01:32:05,050
content environment while we had

1661
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:05,771
the exercise time.

1662
01:32:07,332 --> 01:32:09,023
So you can,

1663
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,765
You can continue from there or

1664
01:32:10,765 --> 01:32:11,786
you can do the exercise

1665
01:32:11,786 --> 01:32:13,428
and start listening when you're done.

1666
01:32:13,428 --> 01:32:14,169
That's also fine.

1667
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,152
One thing I didn't mention is

1668
01:32:17,152 --> 01:32:19,074
that, I mean, clearly this

1669
01:32:19,074 --> 01:32:20,075
exercise is in Python.

1670
01:32:21,517 --> 01:32:22,738
We already mentioned that you

1671
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:24,941
can do, you can use

1672
01:32:24,941 --> 01:32:26,202
other languages than Python.

1673
01:32:26,202 --> 01:32:27,483
You can use R and Julia

1674
01:32:27,483 --> 01:32:28,525
and many others as well.

1675
01:32:29,726 --> 01:32:30,427
So there's a list of

1676
01:32:30,427 --> 01:32:32,209
supported kernels here.

1677
01:32:32,209 --> 01:32:33,410
A kernel is essentially a

1678
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:36,513
way of connecting to a

1679
01:32:36,513 --> 01:32:38,403
specific programming language.

1680
01:32:38,403 --> 01:32:40,025
and running things from the notebook.

1681
01:32:42,669 --> 01:32:45,973
And then yeah, our Markdown and Pluto.jl,

1682
01:32:47,114 --> 01:32:50,859
Pluto or Julia is our

1683
01:32:50,859 --> 01:32:52,201
other alternatives that are very

1684
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:56,146
similar to Jupyter notebooks.

1685
01:32:56,146 --> 01:32:58,690
Okay, but yeah, so the main thing

1686
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:00,853
though from here is we

1687
01:33:00,853 --> 01:33:02,395
have essentially packaged the

1688
01:33:02,395 --> 01:33:07,221
entire story, the calculation of

1689
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:08,491
the value of pi

1690
01:33:08,491 --> 01:33:10,214
And the code that actually

1691
01:33:10,214 --> 01:33:11,776
does the calculation, the results,

1692
01:33:12,678 --> 01:33:16,003
and all of the reasoning into one file,

1693
01:33:16,003 --> 01:33:18,046
like one consistent thing that

1694
01:33:18,046 --> 01:33:19,729
we can then send to,

1695
01:33:19,729 --> 01:33:22,974
for example, our supervisor or the person

1696
01:33:22,974 --> 01:33:24,857
who asked us to do this

1697
01:33:24,857 --> 01:33:27,682
exercise for a course or

1698
01:33:27,682 --> 01:33:29,264
whatever the situation happens to be.

1699
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:31,948
So that's really useful.

1700
01:33:33,471 --> 01:33:34,012
Exactly.

1701
01:33:34,012 --> 01:33:34,753
Okay.

1702
01:33:34,753 --> 01:33:34,853
Yeah.

1703
01:33:37,482 --> 01:33:39,945
Okay, but then there's a downside.

1704
01:33:39,945 --> 01:33:42,028
So version control.

1705
01:33:42,028 --> 01:33:43,811
And it's not actually that bad.

1706
01:33:43,811 --> 01:33:48,557
So Jupyter notebooks are JSON files.

1707
01:33:48,557 --> 01:33:52,222
Let's see, can I open this as a text file?

1708
01:33:53,123 --> 01:33:54,024
Have I saved it?

1709
01:33:54,024 --> 01:33:54,525
No.

1710
01:33:54,525 --> 01:33:55,386
I guess you have to rename.

1711
01:33:55,386 --> 01:33:56,528
There's this dot here.

1712
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:00,153
It is saved, right?

1713
01:34:00,153 --> 01:34:02,155
Yeah, but the kernel is running.

1714
01:34:02,155 --> 01:34:03,197
That's why you'd see that.

1715
01:34:03,197 --> 01:34:03,457
Yeah.

1716
01:34:04,518 --> 01:34:06,085
So, oh, right, that's,

1717
01:34:06,085 --> 01:34:07,487
It's showing that there's a kernel.

1718
01:34:07,487 --> 01:34:08,148
Okay.

1719
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:10,832
If I name it to JSON,

1720
01:34:10,832 --> 01:34:12,414
which is standard for a JSON

1721
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:15,418
file, then I can open it.

1722
01:34:18,222 --> 01:34:22,909
And this is not exactly what I wanted to.

1723
01:34:22,909 --> 01:34:23,950
I mean, this contains all the

1724
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,252
cells and all the data, but

1725
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:28,337
let's do a pure text file.

1726
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:35,279
So we talked about Git a few weeks ago.

1727
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:37,303
a lot and we have used it all the time.

1728
01:34:37,303 --> 01:34:38,765
Git is really good with text files.

1729
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:42,873
And this is a text file.

1730
01:34:44,195 --> 01:34:47,341
So there's a collection of cells.

1731
01:34:47,341 --> 01:34:49,164
It's a list.

1732
01:34:49,164 --> 01:34:51,128
There's a cell type, execution

1733
01:34:51,128 --> 01:34:54,053
count, which is displayed in the notebook.

1734
01:34:54,053 --> 01:34:56,157
There's some metadata and

1735
01:34:57,503 --> 01:35:00,090
the data, then there is out

1736
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,534
if there is an output, then

1737
01:35:01,534 --> 01:35:07,210
this output so okay, somewhere here we have

1738
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,725
This is still a plain text output, I think.

1739
01:35:14,725 --> 01:35:15,907
That's the image from the

1740
01:35:15,907 --> 01:35:18,151
exercise that we imported.

1741
01:35:19,012 --> 01:35:20,374
Okay, yes.

1742
01:35:20,374 --> 01:35:22,097
So this is an image.

1743
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:24,821
This is not very nice text.

1744
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:27,045
It's actually a binary blob.

1745
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:28,287
But that wasn't actually the

1746
01:35:28,287 --> 01:35:29,108
plot that we made.

1747
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,854
We finally get to an actual source code.

1748
01:35:32,854 --> 01:35:35,779
This is a code cell.

1749
01:35:37,902 --> 01:35:39,984
and here we have a code cell.

1750
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,706
So the output, this is

1751
01:35:41,706 --> 01:35:43,087
source, where's the output?

1752
01:35:43,087 --> 01:35:43,548
Okay, here.

1753
01:35:43,548 --> 01:35:46,171
3.14.

1754
01:35:46,171 --> 01:35:46,411
Okay.

1755
01:35:47,472 --> 01:35:48,713
So this is an output.

1756
01:35:48,713 --> 01:35:51,296
This is the actual source code.

1757
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:54,539
Interesting that it's not in order.

1758
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,201
Is it alphabetical?

1759
01:35:58,163 --> 01:35:59,164
Yes, it is.

1760
01:35:59,164 --> 01:36:00,125
Okay, it's alphabetical.

1761
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,627
That's right.

1762
01:36:02,627 --> 01:36:03,949
Okay.

1763
01:36:03,949 --> 01:36:05,691
So, I mean, it's text.

1764
01:36:05,691 --> 01:36:07,687
You can version control this.

1765
01:36:07,687 --> 01:36:08,989
might not be fun to look

1766
01:36:08,989 --> 01:36:10,231
through this and try to figure

1767
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:11,412
out what's going on.

1768
01:36:11,412 --> 01:36:14,076
And this image here is not

1769
01:36:14,076 --> 01:36:15,177
going to look nice if you're

1770
01:36:15,177 --> 01:36:16,519
trying to use Git directly.

1771
01:36:17,881 --> 01:36:18,863
But it's not that bad.

1772
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:22,968
So let's turn it into a notebook.

1773
01:36:22,968 --> 01:36:24,350
It's an IPython notebook.

1774
01:36:25,652 --> 01:36:27,154
And open it.

1775
01:36:30,218 --> 01:36:31,500
Okay, so...

1776
01:36:32,847 --> 01:36:35,150
we have an extension called

1777
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:37,994
nbdime I guess we should yeah

1778
01:36:37,994 --> 01:36:40,298
here's a link to it so ...

1779
01:36:40,298 --> 01:36:43,182
this is the ... the lesson

1780
01:36:43,182 --> 01:36:45,465
page again the lesson materials

1781
01:36:46,827 --> 01:36:49,110
so there's an extension called nbdime

1782
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:50,612
that works with JupyterLab and

1783
01:36:50,612 --> 01:36:53,236
that allows you to actually

1784
01:36:53,236 --> 01:36:56,741
look at this look at

1785
01:36:56,741 --> 01:37:01,670
these notebooks properly in a version control

1786
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:02,291
interface.

1787
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:05,516
So I mean, you can go here to the git tab.

1788
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:10,224
And look at this, these are all new files.

1789
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:13,229
So let's make a change.

1790
01:37:18,737 --> 01:37:19,719
Or rather than make a

1791
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:21,181
comment first and then make a change.

1792
01:37:23,786 --> 01:37:25,148
Okay, there's also a checkpoint

1793
01:37:25,148 --> 01:37:26,009
file, which is nice.

1794
01:37:26,931 --> 01:37:28,453
Like [name] mentioned earlier,

1795
01:37:30,408 --> 01:37:31,569
Okay, and then I want to

1796
01:37:31,569 --> 01:37:33,972
make a change to the actual content.

1797
01:37:33,972 --> 01:37:35,634
So let's again go and

1798
01:37:35,634 --> 01:37:39,999
increase the number of points.

1799
01:37:39,999 --> 01:37:41,341
Now if I look at the change.

1800
01:37:45,366 --> 01:37:46,147
Okay, I need to click

1801
01:37:46,147 --> 01:37:48,249
this button, this with the plus and minus here.

1802
01:37:50,452 --> 01:37:54,517
And maybe hide the version control section.

1803
01:37:54,517 --> 01:37:56,679
So it looks nice.

1804
01:37:56,679 --> 01:37:59,028
And it actually shows you which cell and

1805
01:37:59,028 --> 01:38:00,730
what line on that cell and so on.

1806
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:02,452
It doesn't just look like a JSON file.

1807
01:38:04,735 --> 01:38:07,979
Then we can also go ahead and execute.

1808
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,882
Did I execute this one?

1809
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:10,322
I think so.

1810
01:38:12,565 --> 01:38:12,805
Okay.

1811
01:38:15,809 --> 01:38:17,171
Whoop, there we have a new image as well.

1812
01:38:18,052 --> 01:38:20,274
So if you just look at the text again,

1813
01:38:20,274 --> 01:38:21,977
it will just show the entire

1814
01:38:21,977 --> 01:38:24,500
binary blob as a difference, which is huge.

1815
01:38:25,821 --> 01:38:28,765
If you look at the difference from here,

1816
01:38:30,972 --> 01:38:32,033
I didn't save the file.

1817
01:38:33,975 --> 01:38:34,736
Okay.

1818
01:38:34,736 --> 01:38:35,377
Now, if you look at

1819
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:37,419
the difference from here, it

1820
01:38:37,419 --> 01:38:39,120
shows that there's a change here.

1821
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,162
There's a change in this

1822
01:38:40,162 --> 01:38:41,463
cell, but that's only output.

1823
01:38:42,864 --> 01:38:44,206
So there's no actual changes

1824
01:38:44,206 --> 01:38:45,287
here in the code itself.

1825
01:38:46,148 --> 01:38:46,568
Same here.

1826
01:38:47,609 --> 01:38:48,790
Outputs changed.

1827
01:38:51,914 --> 01:38:52,955
I guess this doesn't look

1828
01:38:52,955 --> 01:38:58,546
that great either, but well,

1829
01:38:58,546 --> 01:39:00,929
You can actually see both images here.

1830
01:39:00,929 --> 01:39:02,931
If you like zoom out,

1831
01:39:02,931 --> 01:39:03,972
maybe it looks better.

1832
01:39:03,972 --> 01:39:04,292
I don't know.

1833
01:39:05,834 --> 01:39:06,234
Not really.

1834
01:39:09,398 --> 01:39:10,659
I'm actually a bit disappointed

1835
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:12,922
by how it looks like right now.

1836
01:39:12,922 --> 01:39:14,223
I'm used to it looking much better,

1837
01:39:15,124 --> 01:39:16,646
but it shows that the

1838
01:39:16,646 --> 01:39:17,787
picture is different and you can

1839
01:39:17,787 --> 01:39:20,249
actually see a preview of both images.

1840
01:39:20,249 --> 01:39:22,712
So that's much more useful

1841
01:39:22,712 --> 01:39:23,993
than just saying the whole

1842
01:39:23,993 --> 01:39:25,455
binary blob is different.

1843
01:39:25,455 --> 01:39:26,977
And the output, there's an

1844
01:39:26,977 --> 01:39:28,198
output here and it's different.

1845
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,122
Actually, here is only the

1846
01:39:32,122 --> 01:39:34,705
run count that has changed in these two cells.

1847
01:39:36,247 --> 01:39:36,507
Okay.

1848
01:39:37,629 --> 01:39:44,257
So now we can go ahead and add to this.

1849
01:39:44,257 --> 01:39:49,263
So what should we say?

1850
01:39:49,263 --> 01:39:56,613
Increase the number of points.

1851
01:39:56,613 --> 01:39:56,953
Okay.

1852
01:40:01,203 --> 01:40:06,889
Okay, so next, going back

1853
01:40:06,889 --> 01:40:11,754
to the materials, should I also

1854
01:40:11,754 --> 01:40:13,456
show this in VS Code?

1855
01:40:13,456 --> 01:40:14,117
If you look at the

1856
01:40:14,117 --> 01:40:15,478
version control interface, if you're

1857
01:40:15,478 --> 01:40:16,800
using VS Code, you will see

1858
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,922
that the Jupyter extension actually

1859
01:40:18,922 --> 01:40:20,063
makes it look nice.

1860
01:40:23,487 --> 01:40:24,808
So you can see the differences

1861
01:40:24,808 --> 01:40:25,349
in a nice way.

1862
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,654
One other thing is GitHub.

1863
01:40:29,654 --> 01:40:31,997
So we have been using that a lot as well.

1864
01:40:33,038 --> 01:40:34,620
If you haven't done anything

1865
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:40,367
to make it look nice, then

1866
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,149
it will not look nice.

1867
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:44,232
So we can go ahead and

1868
01:40:44,232 --> 01:40:45,433
look at the notebook.

1869
01:40:47,676 --> 01:40:49,738
So this is actually the

1870
01:40:49,738 --> 01:40:52,021
example, this is the solution

1871
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:54,204
to the exercise or the notebook

1872
01:40:54,204 --> 01:40:59,219
where you can continue from for the next part.

1873
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:00,501
but this is now looking

1874
01:41:00,501 --> 01:41:02,944
at the difference between two different comets.

1875
01:41:07,129 --> 01:41:09,372
And this is not very useful.

1876
01:41:09,372 --> 01:41:10,354
I mean, I see that the

1877
01:41:10,354 --> 01:41:12,977
image is different, but it's

1878
01:41:12,977 --> 01:41:15,180
not quite, not very nice to read.

1879
01:41:18,584 --> 01:41:21,768
So there is a way of,

1880
01:41:21,768 --> 01:41:23,591
there's a feature, a feature preview.

1881
01:41:23,591 --> 01:41:24,472
So if you click on

1882
01:41:24,472 --> 01:41:28,037
your profile, feature preview, there

1883
01:41:28,037 --> 01:41:29,392
is this rich,

1884
01:41:29,392 --> 01:41:30,974
Jupyter notebook diffs.

1885
01:41:31,935 --> 01:41:33,197
If you enable that one, this

1886
01:41:33,197 --> 01:41:35,801
has been in beta for, I don't know

1887
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:38,104
how long, or preview for, I

1888
01:41:38,104 --> 01:41:39,285
don't know, as long as

1889
01:41:39,285 --> 01:41:40,908
CodeRefinery has existed or

1890
01:41:40,908 --> 01:41:42,990
something like that.

1891
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:44,192
So when you enable that and

1892
01:41:44,192 --> 01:41:48,638
you reload the page, now it

1893
01:41:48,638 --> 01:41:50,541
looks quite a bit better.

1894
01:41:52,063 --> 01:41:53,705
So here we again have a

1895
01:41:55,668 --> 01:41:58,892
better picture of what has changed on this.

1896
01:41:59,716 --> 01:42:01,858
cells these code cells but

1897
01:42:01,858 --> 01:42:05,002
also the images now actually

1898
01:42:05,002 --> 01:42:09,087
display correctly so this is the old image

1899
01:42:09,087 --> 01:42:10,308
and this is the new one

1900
01:42:10,308 --> 01:42:14,313
after the commit some colors have changed

1901
01:42:14,313 --> 01:42:17,156
and the size has changed yeah

1902
01:42:17,156 --> 01:42:21,181
okay ... one downside though is that

1903
01:42:21,181 --> 01:42:22,883
when git git remembers

1904
01:42:22,883 --> 01:42:24,865
everything it remembers all of

1905
01:42:24,865 --> 01:42:27,408
the previous versions so if

1906
01:42:27,408 --> 01:42:29,568
you keep changing an image or

1907
01:42:29,568 --> 01:42:33,152
a video and you commit

1908
01:42:33,152 --> 01:42:35,034
those changes, you will keep

1909
01:42:35,034 --> 01:42:38,298
actually all of the versions of that video.

1910
01:42:38,298 --> 01:42:39,640
And if it's an image, maybe

1911
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,661
it's not that bad.

1912
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:42,623
If it's a video and it's a big one,

1913
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:43,404
it might take a lot of

1914
01:42:43,404 --> 01:42:45,126
space and take a long time

1915
01:42:45,126 --> 01:42:48,349
to then clone the repository or push and pull.

1916
01:42:50,632 --> 01:42:54,897
So yeah, that might be then

1917
01:42:54,897 --> 01:42:56,439
good to remove the image at

1918
01:42:56,439 --> 01:42:59,048
some point, but okay.

1919
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:01,613
It works still pretty well.

1920
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:04,059
So we did this comparing

1921
01:43:04,059 --> 01:43:06,203
notebooks locally already.

1922
01:43:08,087 --> 01:43:11,334
And there is nbdime from the command line.

1923
01:43:12,817 --> 01:43:13,719
I don't know, do I

1924
01:43:13,719 --> 01:43:15,363
have actually these commands?

1925
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:18,289
Should we try?

1926
01:43:19,602 --> 01:43:21,224
Yeah, but I guess the

1927
01:43:21,224 --> 01:43:23,266
audience gets the idea that

1928
01:43:23,266 --> 01:43:24,808
Jupyter Notebook works with

1929
01:43:24,808 --> 01:43:25,930
version controlling, but there

1930
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:26,711
are some limitations.

1931
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:28,853
You also have to enable

1932
01:43:28,853 --> 01:43:31,156
some feature or install a

1933
01:43:31,156 --> 01:43:33,038
plugin or something like that.

1934
01:43:33,879 --> 01:43:35,001
Yeah, you always essentially

1935
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:37,223
have to install something to make it work.

1936
01:43:37,223 --> 01:43:39,406
And for VS Code, it's

1937
01:43:39,406 --> 01:43:41,489
the same Jupyter plugin, which is nice.

1938
01:43:41,489 --> 01:43:47,095
But it's interesting that for JupyterLab,

1939
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:48,257
you still need to install

1940
01:43:48,257 --> 01:43:49,623
something to make it work.

1941
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:50,984
Like it doesn't work out of the box.

1942
01:43:52,566 --> 01:43:52,746
Yeah.

1943
01:43:55,169 --> 01:43:59,233
Okay.

1944
01:43:59,233 --> 01:43:59,594
I guess.

1945
01:43:59,594 --> 01:44:00,234
Yeah.

1946
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,697
Let's go on.

1947
01:44:02,697 --> 01:44:03,858
You can go with the sharing.

1948
01:44:03,858 --> 01:44:04,659
Yes.

1949
01:44:04,659 --> 01:44:05,720
Yeah.

1950
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,641
So, but yeah, I mean,

1951
01:44:06,641 --> 01:44:08,823
essentially you probably do want

1952
01:44:08,823 --> 01:44:12,387
to enable those features in

1953
01:44:12,387 --> 01:44:14,530
whatever editor and interface

1954
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:16,211
you're using, and especially if

1955
01:44:16,211 --> 01:44:16,812
you're using GitHub.

1956
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:19,787
Okay, but yeah, then we'll

1957
01:44:19,787 --> 01:44:21,449
talk about sharing notebooks.

1958
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:23,891
So we have talked a lot

1959
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:25,132
about sharing code and the

1960
01:44:25,132 --> 01:44:26,414
upsides are essentially the same.

1961
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:29,777
But often it is also

1962
01:44:30,658 --> 01:44:33,802
useful to specifically share notebooks

1963
01:44:33,802 --> 01:44:36,344
for documentation and to show

1964
01:44:37,265 --> 01:44:40,569
how to describe how the

1965
01:44:40,569 --> 01:44:45,634
process works to generate your paper and so on.

1966
01:44:47,369 --> 01:44:50,172
So there's a bunch of ways of doing that.

1967
01:44:50,172 --> 01:44:51,754
And the simplest one is to

1968
01:44:51,754 --> 01:44:53,416
put it on GitHub or GitLab

1969
01:44:53,416 --> 01:44:56,499
or any interface like that and

1970
01:44:56,499 --> 01:44:57,300
people can see it.

1971
01:44:59,703 --> 01:45:00,904
You can turn it into a

1972
01:45:00,904 --> 01:45:04,128
website that looks nicer and it's

1973
01:45:04,128 --> 01:45:05,309
a bit easier to access.

1974
01:45:07,091 --> 01:45:09,434
Those are essentially static options.

1975
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:11,496
So people cannot edit the code

1976
01:45:11,496 --> 01:45:12,698
and they cannot run the code,

1977
01:45:12,698 --> 01:45:13,979
but they can see the entire

1978
01:45:13,979 --> 01:45:16,208
story and they can see the results.

1979
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:18,111
Those are nice ways of doing it.

1980
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:19,353
But then there's also ways

1981
01:45:19,353 --> 01:45:21,195
of sharing it that make

1982
01:45:21,195 --> 01:45:23,719
it actually dynamic where you can edit it.

1983
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:25,221
So we already talked about Binder

1984
01:45:25,221 --> 01:45:26,403
and we showed you a couple

1985
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:27,385
of notebooks in Binder.

1986
01:45:31,731 --> 01:45:34,535
JupyterLab supports sharing via

1987
01:45:34,535 --> 01:45:35,537
Google Drive.

1988
01:45:35,537 --> 01:45:36,258
Okay.

1989
01:45:36,258 --> 01:45:37,660
I'm always surprised by that.

1990
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:41,946
That's a relatively new feature.

1991
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,795
And then there's a bunch of other options.

1992
01:45:44,795 --> 01:45:47,057
There's JupyterLite and EGI Notebooks

1993
01:45:48,558 --> 01:45:49,999
that helped you actually share

1994
01:45:49,999 --> 01:45:56,585
a live version of the page or of the notebook.

1995
01:45:56,585 --> 01:45:56,825
Okay.

1996
01:45:57,826 --> 01:46:02,270
So one option that we might

1997
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:04,812
as well show you rather than

1998
01:46:04,812 --> 01:46:11,798
just describe is, so here we have a file cell.

1999
01:46:12,925 --> 01:46:13,706
What is happening?

2000
01:46:13,706 --> 01:46:14,047
Okay.

2001
01:46:14,047 --> 01:46:16,050
So we have the file selected here.

2002
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:19,316
We can export, save and

2003
01:46:20,258 --> 01:46:21,720
export notebook as, and then we

2004
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,684
can save it as say HTML.

2005
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:26,609
Okay.

2006
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:29,975
This is going into downloads, I guess.

2007
01:46:29,975 --> 01:46:30,456
That's fine.

2008
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:33,661
And we can open it.

2009
01:46:33,661 --> 01:46:36,226
So, so now this is a,

2010
01:46:36,226 --> 01:46:38,305
this is a website that you can send.

2011
01:46:38,305 --> 01:46:39,787
You can put this on GitHub

2012
01:46:39,787 --> 01:46:42,571
and people can open it on github.io,

2013
01:46:42,571 --> 01:46:44,715
or you can just send it to people

2014
01:46:44,715 --> 01:46:45,716
and they can open it

2015
01:46:45,716 --> 01:46:47,138
without any editors and without

2016
01:46:47,138 --> 01:46:53,508
any viewers, because it is just a website.

2017
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:53,868
Okay.

2018
01:46:57,394 --> 01:46:58,555
But it's an HTML one,

2019
01:46:58,555 --> 01:47:00,198
so you cannot actually run

2020
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:03,663
the Python code, right?

2021
01:47:03,663 --> 01:47:04,845
You can just see... Yes, you

2022
01:47:04,845 --> 01:47:06,287
cannot run the Python code.

2023
01:47:06,287 --> 01:47:08,545
It's purely HTML.

2024
01:47:08,545 --> 01:47:12,030
There's also Google Colab, Google

2025
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:12,831
Calc and so on.

2026
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:14,854
These are commercial offers

2027
01:47:14,854 --> 01:47:18,600
with free plans, which means

2028
01:47:19,742 --> 01:47:23,447
they are by commercial companies.

2029
01:47:24,769 --> 01:47:28,134
And yeah, they are also

2030
01:47:28,134 --> 01:47:28,975
pretty good options.

2031
01:47:30,417 --> 01:47:32,560
So there's a lot of options

2032
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,283
and it depends on what you want.

2033
01:47:35,933 --> 01:47:41,740
We are going to do this

2034
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:42,681
as an exercise, right?

2035
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:42,862
Yes.

2036
01:47:44,023 --> 01:47:45,205
So we're going to have an

2037
01:47:45,205 --> 01:47:50,391
exercise where we share a notebook on Binder.

2038
01:47:50,391 --> 01:47:53,014
So to do that, though, what

2039
01:47:53,014 --> 01:47:54,416
you need to do first is

2040
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:57,400
have a Git repository with a notebook.

2041
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:00,604
So if you didn't already,

2042
01:48:00,604 --> 01:48:01,765
there was a button here

2043
01:48:01,765 --> 01:48:03,848
to initialize repository.

2044
01:48:06,106 --> 01:48:12,554
And then, I mean, if you

2045
01:48:12,554 --> 01:48:13,835
were here in the first week,

2046
01:48:15,638 --> 01:48:17,800
you know the steps to push

2047
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:20,784
the notebook to GitHub.

2048
01:48:23,327 --> 01:48:25,469
And I'm wondering, should I show that?

2049
01:48:25,469 --> 01:48:26,911
And how should I show that?

2050
01:48:28,033 --> 01:48:30,355
Because I do not have the,

2051
01:48:31,196 --> 01:48:32,518
there is no interface for it here.

2052
01:48:35,165 --> 01:48:36,767
I don't think you can push it from there.

2053
01:48:37,687 --> 01:48:38,568
I can open a terminal.

2054
01:48:39,489 --> 01:48:39,709
Yes.

2055
01:48:43,053 --> 01:48:44,034
And then I have to

2056
01:48:44,034 --> 01:48:46,316
create a GitHub repository.

2057
01:48:58,268 --> 01:48:59,849
And here it's important.

2058
01:48:59,849 --> 01:49:05,354
So, ... by example, okay.

2059
01:49:05,354 --> 01:49:07,957
So here it's important to, first of all,

2060
01:49:09,058 --> 01:49:10,620
make it public if you're sharing it

2061
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:14,223
and start with no readme

2062
01:49:14,223 --> 01:49:16,125
file, no gitignore and no

2063
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:18,448
license, essentially an empty repository.

2064
01:49:19,409 --> 01:49:21,391
And the reason for that is

2065
01:49:22,212 --> 01:49:23,994
that we already have files in

2066
01:49:23,994 --> 01:49:27,858
this existing git repository.

2067
01:49:29,019 --> 01:49:29,860
Actually, we can copy the

2068
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:32,543
commands from here, git remote add.

2069
01:49:34,008 --> 01:49:35,590
So we already have files in here.

2070
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:37,452
So if you create any files

2071
01:49:37,452 --> 01:49:39,475
in the remote repository, it

2072
01:49:39,475 --> 01:49:43,499
will refuse to push.

2073
01:49:45,061 --> 01:49:47,204
Okay, so I'm going to do

2074
01:49:47,204 --> 01:49:51,569
this step and I probably should

2075
01:49:51,569 --> 01:49:52,510
be a bit more explicit.

2076
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,332
So this is preparation for

2077
01:49:54,332 --> 01:49:56,495
the exercise that you will also need to do,

2078
01:49:56,495 --> 01:49:58,638
but I don't think it's 100%

2079
01:49:58,638 --> 01:50:00,400
clear on the exercise page.

2080
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:03,103
So you need to have a

2081
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:06,502
Git repository that you push

2082
01:50:06,502 --> 01:50:07,944
to GitHub and then you can

2083
01:50:07,944 --> 01:50:08,965
do the binder exercise.

2084
01:50:10,967 --> 01:50:12,910
And preferably the Git

2085
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:14,692
repository should have a notebook in it.

2086
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:16,794
So the exercise notebook is a

2087
01:50:16,794 --> 01:50:18,076
good one to have.

2088
01:50:19,017 --> 01:50:20,799
So I made a branch called main.

2089
01:50:20,799 --> 01:50:22,081
I'm essentially, I'm just

2090
01:50:22,081 --> 01:50:23,963
copying these commands from here

2091
01:50:23,963 --> 01:50:25,765
and running them in a terminal.

2092
01:50:25,765 --> 01:50:27,648
Another option is to use VS Code.

2093
01:50:27,648 --> 01:50:30,111
There you can just publish to GitHub.

2094
01:50:30,111 --> 01:50:31,192
There's a button that says

2095
01:50:31,192 --> 01:50:33,715
publish to GitHub and that should work.

2096
01:50:35,753 --> 01:50:38,316
Okay, so now I have a Git repository

2097
01:50:38,316 --> 01:50:39,799
that I can actually push,

2098
01:50:41,681 --> 01:50:42,542
where I can actually push

2099
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:44,044
the changes to GitHub.

2100
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:48,891
So if I reload this, I probably have it.

2101
01:50:48,891 --> 01:50:50,153
Yes, I have the notebook here.

2102
01:50:51,354 --> 01:50:54,439
And that is, so let's go to the exercise.

2103
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:55,300
That is essentially the

2104
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,001
starting point here.

2105
01:50:57,062 --> 01:51:02,838
So first you create a repository.

2106
01:51:02,838 --> 01:51:04,520
And then you need to add some files.

2107
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,282
So for Jupyter notebooks, R

2108
01:51:06,282 --> 01:51:07,643
notebooks, it's a bit different.

2109
01:51:08,724 --> 01:51:09,625
And after that, you should

2110
01:51:09,625 --> 01:51:11,488
be able to launch it on Binder.

2111
01:51:11,488 --> 01:51:13,470
So the exercise is to do

2112
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:16,954
these steps and to modify

2113
01:51:16,954 --> 01:51:19,276
your notebook on Binder.

2114
01:51:20,117 --> 01:51:21,438
I definitely shouldn't go any

2115
01:51:21,438 --> 01:51:23,180
further in it because then I

2116
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,342
would be just doing the exercise.

2117
01:51:28,206 --> 01:51:29,527
Is it clear?

2118
01:51:29,527 --> 01:51:30,849
Because the reason I'm still

2119
01:51:30,849 --> 01:51:33,449
talking is that I feel it's a bit unclear.

2120
01:51:33,449 --> 01:51:36,752
I think it's clear.

2121
01:51:36,752 --> 01:51:38,074
Yeah.

2122
01:51:38,074 --> 01:51:38,194
Yeah.

2123
01:51:38,194 --> 01:51:39,535
So follow the instructions here.

2124
01:51:39,535 --> 01:51:40,856
And if you have any questions,

2125
01:51:40,856 --> 01:51:41,637
then let us know.

2126
01:51:41,637 --> 01:51:42,738
The end result is that

2127
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:49,785
your notebook should be on Binder.

2128
01:51:49,785 --> 01:51:51,687
It should be online and in such a way

2129
01:51:51,687 --> 01:51:54,029
that you can edit it and rerun things

2130
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:54,790
and fiddle around with

2131
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:56,472
things without actually having

2132
01:51:56,472 --> 01:52:00,576
Jupyter yourself.

2133
01:52:00,576 --> 01:52:01,192
Yeah.

2134
01:52:01,192 --> 01:52:07,040
So we'll go for 12

2135
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,043
minutes enough because it says,

2136
01:52:09,043 --> 01:52:11,706
let's say 15 minutes.

2137
01:52:13,309 --> 01:52:13,829
Or 15.

2138
01:52:13,829 --> 01:52:16,753
15 minutes, yeah.

2139
01:52:16,753 --> 01:52:20,318
So it will be 55.

2140
01:52:20,318 --> 01:52:21,159
Okay, 55.

2141
01:52:21,159 --> 01:52:21,780
Yeah.

2142
01:52:25,946 --> 01:52:26,206
Okay.

2143
01:52:28,109 --> 01:52:28,870
Yeah, I guess nobody's

2144
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:30,908
asking questions, so...

2145
01:52:30,908 --> 01:52:32,191
Hopefully it's clear enough.

2146
01:52:32,191 --> 01:52:34,798
If it's not clear at all,

2147
01:52:34,798 --> 01:52:35,600
and that's the reason you're

2148
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,307
not asking questions, then let

2149
01:52:38,307 --> 01:52:38,909
us know somehow.

2150
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:41,817
And otherwise, see you back

2151
01:52:41,817 --> 01:52:42,880
here in 15 minutes.

2152
01:52:43,962 --> 01:52:44,785
All right.

2153
01:52:44,785 --> 01:52:44,985
Bye.

2154
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:35,928
Welcome back.

2155
02:08:39,832 --> 02:08:41,134
Only two people have voted

2156
02:08:41,134 --> 02:08:42,836
that they are done with the exercise.

2157
02:08:42,836 --> 02:08:47,921
So okay, now this one more vote.

2158
02:08:50,644 --> 02:08:52,326
If you have questions, or

2159
02:08:52,326 --> 02:08:54,448
if you have trouble, let us know.

2160
02:08:56,811 --> 02:08:59,514
But yes, so I think I

2161
02:08:59,514 --> 02:09:02,757
will start going through the steps a bit.

2162
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:04,782
already.

2163
02:09:04,782 --> 02:09:07,333
Oh, it takes forever to launch.

2164
02:09:07,333 --> 02:09:07,595
Okay.

2165
02:09:07,595 --> 02:09:07,816
Yes.

2166
02:09:08,659 --> 02:09:09,925
It's building the environment for

2167
02:09:09,925 --> 02:09:10,608
the first time.

2168
02:09:10,608 --> 02:09:14,164
It does take a long time.

2169
02:09:16,237 --> 02:09:18,599
let's see how quickly it happens

2170
02:09:18,599 --> 02:09:21,162
for me and while I'm doing

2171
02:09:21,162 --> 02:09:24,405
this you can also finish the exercise

2172
02:09:24,405 --> 02:09:27,869
if you have if you're still

2173
02:09:27,869 --> 02:09:29,891
in the middle of it okay

2174
02:09:29,891 --> 02:09:31,873
so I'm going to actually move

2175
02:09:31,873 --> 02:09:37,098
this window out of the shared

2176
02:09:37,098 --> 02:09:40,682
area and we see our my

2177
02:09:41,823 --> 02:09:44,185
repository with the notebook in it so

2178
02:09:45,397 --> 02:09:48,782
And the first step was to create a file.

2179
02:09:48,782 --> 02:09:50,645
So here, create a new file.

2180
02:09:51,506 --> 02:09:53,990
It's called requirements.txt.

2181
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:58,036
I should be typing here, requirements.txt.

2182
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:04,205
So this is a relatively

2183
02:10:04,205 --> 02:10:06,248
standard way of telling what

2184
02:10:06,248 --> 02:10:08,531
Python packages a program needs.

2185
02:10:08,531 --> 02:10:10,574
And what we need is matplotlib.

2186
02:10:11,736 --> 02:10:13,699
And we're giving a specific version of it.

2187
02:10:15,417 --> 02:10:17,219
And this is telling Binder

2188
02:10:17,219 --> 02:10:22,064
and other programs also what

2189
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:23,166
Python packages we need.

2190
02:10:23,166 --> 02:10:24,807
So there's different formats

2191
02:10:24,807 --> 02:10:26,169
for different languages usually.

2192
02:10:27,771 --> 02:10:29,452
Okay, let's commit to change.

2193
02:10:30,313 --> 02:10:32,075
Create requirements.txt is actually

2194
02:10:32,075 --> 02:10:33,657
a very good description.

2195
02:10:33,657 --> 02:10:34,398
So let's keep it.

2196
02:10:37,241 --> 02:10:39,964
And that is in fact enough

2197
02:10:39,964 --> 02:10:40,885
to run it in Binder.

2198
02:10:41,742 --> 02:10:45,447
So then I'll open mybinder.org.

2199
02:10:45,447 --> 02:10:47,150
We'll move it to this window.

2200
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:48,151
Okay, good.

2201
02:10:49,954 --> 02:10:52,898
And I need the repository URL,

2202
02:10:52,898 --> 02:10:54,480
which I get by going to

2203
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:57,965
the repository, to the main folder.

2204
02:10:59,307 --> 02:11:06,057
And actually it's probably this URL, right?

2205
02:11:06,057 --> 02:11:06,998
Actually, not exactly.

2206
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:10,244
Yeah, it's

2207
02:11:10,244 --> 02:11:11,806
without the tree and the main.

2208
02:11:11,806 --> 02:11:13,187
So it's like this, I think.

2209
02:11:16,030 --> 02:11:17,852
We're taking the main branch,

2210
02:11:18,672 --> 02:11:19,994
so not writing anything here.

2211
02:11:20,915 --> 02:11:24,438
And the file is actually

2212
02:11:24,438 --> 02:11:29,643
called pi.ipynb, IPython notebook.

2213
02:11:30,965 --> 02:11:33,127
Okay, and that creates this URL.

2214
02:11:34,548 --> 02:11:37,551
There's also a badge for readme file.

2215
02:11:39,573 --> 02:11:43,637
So we can copy that and

2216
02:11:43,637 --> 02:11:44,639
create a readme file.

2217
02:11:47,241 --> 02:11:53,348
Create a new file, readme.md.

2218
02:11:53,348 --> 02:11:55,130
So markdown, md for markdown,

2219
02:11:56,111 --> 02:11:58,394
which is also relatively standard,

2220
02:11:58,394 --> 02:11:59,855
at least for GitHub and GitLab.

2221
02:12:00,936 --> 02:12:01,357
Okay.

2222
02:12:01,357 --> 02:12:02,118
Commit changes.

2223
02:12:03,639 --> 02:12:04,720
And again, the description

2224
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:06,082
is actually pretty good.

2225
02:12:06,082 --> 02:12:08,905
So the default one, create readme.markdown.

2226
02:12:09,931 --> 02:12:11,112
Although the only thing we

2227
02:12:11,112 --> 02:12:13,254
added there is this launch binder.

2228
02:12:13,254 --> 02:12:16,497
So that actually is this

2229
02:12:16,497 --> 02:12:19,179
link essentially or link to this URL.

2230
02:12:19,179 --> 02:12:21,641
So we can go ahead and link here.

2231
02:12:25,445 --> 02:12:27,046
So now it's actually, I

2232
02:12:27,046 --> 02:12:27,927
don't know what's happening here.

2233
02:12:32,931 --> 02:12:36,234
But it's essentially creating a,

2234
02:12:37,655 --> 02:12:40,289
not exactly a virtual machine, a container.

2235
02:12:40,289 --> 02:12:42,631
that can run the notebook and

2236
02:12:42,631 --> 02:12:44,272
that then has the requirements,

2237
02:12:44,272 --> 02:12:46,474
the Python packages installed that we need.

2238
02:12:48,356 --> 02:12:48,576
Okay.

2239
02:12:49,957 --> 02:12:52,079
That was surprisingly quick

2240
02:12:54,001 --> 02:12:56,864
and it's displaying the notebook nicely.

2241
02:12:56,864 --> 02:12:59,686
So let's run all the

2242
02:12:59,686 --> 02:13:01,468
cells from beginning to the end.

2243
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:06,692
This might actually, yeah.

2244
02:13:06,692 --> 02:13:07,072
Okay.

2245
02:13:07,072 --> 02:13:07,573
It didn't work.

2246
02:13:08,774 --> 02:13:09,975
This is interesting.

2247
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,422
It's also jumping around a bit.

2248
02:13:17,104 --> 02:13:17,945
Oh, it's weird.

2249
02:13:17,945 --> 02:13:19,787
It jumps around, but...

2250
02:13:19,787 --> 02:13:21,188
Okay, that's better.

2251
02:13:21,188 --> 02:13:23,170
So it was able to run everything else,

2252
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:25,813
but this one, matplotlib,

2253
02:13:25,813 --> 02:13:28,876
the plotting library somehow fails.

2254
02:13:28,876 --> 02:13:30,618
I think it's because the

2255
02:13:30,618 --> 02:13:33,381
inline thing, or no?

2256
02:13:35,503 --> 02:13:36,364
Oh, okay.

2257
02:13:36,364 --> 02:13:38,907
This is a new version of NumPy.

2258
02:13:38,907 --> 02:13:40,229
So we are using such an

2259
02:13:40,229 --> 02:13:42,591
old version of matplotlib.

2260
02:13:42,591 --> 02:13:43,472
Let's go back a bit.

2261
02:13:45,443 --> 02:13:47,286
Yeah, yes, leave.

2262
02:13:48,328 --> 02:13:49,510
So we're using such an

2263
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:52,234
old version of matplotlib that it actually,

2264
02:13:52,234 --> 02:13:53,676
the current version of numpy

2265
02:13:53,676 --> 02:13:54,558
doesn't work anymore.

2266
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,002
So we can try removing the

2267
02:13:57,002 --> 02:14:01,409
version and I'll just keep update.requirements.txt.

2268
02:14:01,409 --> 02:14:02,891
It is not a good description,

2269
02:14:02,891 --> 02:14:03,593
but it's good enough.

2270
02:14:04,755 --> 02:14:05,015
Okay.

2271
02:14:05,015 --> 02:14:07,920
Somebody used matplotlib 3.10

2272
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:08,861
and it worked.

2273
02:14:08,861 --> 02:14:09,342
That's nice.

2274
02:14:11,802 --> 02:14:13,664
I'll just try that again and

2275
02:14:13,664 --> 02:14:16,929
also then see what's next in the materials.

2276
02:14:16,929 --> 02:14:18,471
So there was this optional

2277
02:14:18,471 --> 02:14:21,375
exercise about looking at

2278
02:14:21,375 --> 02:14:24,098
the activity repository and then

2279
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:29,085
one that mentions Python widgets

2280
02:14:30,267 --> 02:14:31,148
or IPy widgets.

2281
02:14:33,191 --> 02:14:35,814
So I will actually skip those

2282
02:14:35,814 --> 02:14:38,017
and go directly to a section

2283
02:14:38,017 --> 02:14:39,419
and the next section.

2284
02:14:41,422 --> 02:14:42,110
So

2285
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:44,292
Next section is summary, but

2286
02:14:44,292 --> 02:14:45,693
we'll go to examples of

2287
02:14:45,693 --> 02:14:48,256
Jupyter features, an optional episode,

2288
02:14:48,256 --> 02:14:49,797
and specifically from here,

2289
02:14:49,797 --> 02:14:51,739
widgets for interactive data fitting.

2290
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:55,542
So I will, again, move this

2291
02:14:55,542 --> 02:14:56,703
out of the screen share.

2292
02:14:58,025 --> 02:14:59,326
And now we're in a binder window.

2293
02:14:59,326 --> 02:15:01,588
So it's actually here, it's

2294
02:15:01,588 --> 02:15:06,152
opening the binder exercise, the result.

2295
02:15:06,953 --> 02:15:09,535
So I can try running everything again.

2296
02:15:13,970 --> 02:15:14,771
Okay.

2297
02:15:14,771 --> 02:15:16,293
And this time it works.

2298
02:15:16,293 --> 02:15:16,834
Okay.

2299
02:15:16,834 --> 02:15:17,495
So that's Binder.

2300
02:15:18,517 --> 02:15:20,500
It looks exactly the same

2301
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:23,344
as JupyterLab, but the point is

2302
02:15:23,344 --> 02:15:25,707
that it's not actually running on my laptop.

2303
02:15:25,707 --> 02:15:26,608
So I don't have to

2304
02:15:26,608 --> 02:15:27,990
have anything installed to run it.

2305
02:15:29,152 --> 02:15:31,315
Anyone can go to this website

2306
02:15:31,315 --> 02:15:33,438
and see my notebook and

2307
02:15:33,438 --> 02:15:36,263
run it without having to install anything.

2308
02:15:36,263 --> 02:15:37,244
It's a very useful way

2309
02:15:37,244 --> 02:15:38,145
of sharing your results.

2310
02:15:40,088 --> 02:15:40,348
Okay.

2311
02:15:41,891 --> 02:15:43,453
So I'll also close this one.

2312
02:15:44,513 --> 02:15:45,174
Yes, leave.

2313
02:15:46,536 --> 02:15:48,939
And then we'll go to this,

2314
02:15:48,939 --> 02:15:51,122
which is for interactive data fitting section.

2315
02:15:51,122 --> 02:15:53,185
So this is in Jupyter/examples.

2316
02:15:55,167 --> 02:15:57,410
Unless there's some questions.

2317
02:15:59,313 --> 02:16:01,436
Okay, no, we're going well.

2318
02:16:01,436 --> 02:16:02,036
Doing well.

2319
02:16:02,036 --> 02:16:05,421
Okay, so let's create a,

2320
02:16:05,421 --> 02:16:08,946
I think a completely new notebook.

2321
02:16:11,249 --> 02:16:12,651
Oh, is it widgets or

2322
02:16:12,651 --> 02:16:14,453
interactive data fitting?

2323
02:16:16,272 --> 02:16:18,397
No, no, no, that it's,

2324
02:16:22,044 --> 02:16:23,888
there's a separate part that

2325
02:16:23,888 --> 02:16:26,995
introduces widgets and that seems

2326
02:16:26,995 --> 02:16:27,716
to come later.

2327
02:16:27,716 --> 02:16:31,244
Like are these, or did

2328
02:16:31,244 --> 02:16:34,230
I skip something that I was supposed to?

2329
02:16:37,366 --> 02:16:39,228
I also get confused.

2330
02:16:39,228 --> 02:16:42,892
It should be... There's a

2331
02:16:42,892 --> 02:16:45,694
widgets one inside the shell command.

2332
02:16:45,694 --> 02:16:47,076
Okay, yes.

2333
02:16:47,076 --> 02:16:48,197
So let's go back to

2334
02:16:48,197 --> 02:16:50,699
the Jupyter Notebooks main page.

2335
02:16:50,699 --> 02:16:51,680
And from there, go to

2336
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:53,302
shell commands, metrics, and widgets.

2337
02:16:54,123 --> 02:16:55,845
And here it's relatively close

2338
02:16:55,845 --> 02:16:57,406
to the bottom of the page.

2339
02:16:57,406 --> 02:16:58,787
Well, actually here, halfway.

2340
02:16:59,728 --> 02:17:01,270
So here's the widgets section.

2341
02:17:02,251 --> 02:17:05,314
And the link, I will put it in the notes.

2342
02:17:10,002 --> 02:17:13,887
No, that's the, okay, widgets here.

2343
02:17:13,887 --> 02:17:15,729
Okay, so now it's in the notes.

2344
02:17:15,729 --> 02:17:16,911
All right, sorry about that.

2345
02:17:16,911 --> 02:17:18,353
We got confused about our own thing.

2346
02:17:19,154 --> 02:17:21,257
Okay.

2347
02:17:21,257 --> 02:17:25,102
I mean, mainly because widgets

2348
02:17:25,102 --> 02:17:27,545
is late in the title of

2349
02:17:27,545 --> 02:17:30,128
the page, which I should read the whole thing.

2350
02:17:31,229 --> 02:17:34,534
Okay, so I'll create a new notebook.

2351
02:17:35,355 --> 02:17:38,659
You can do it from here.

2352
02:17:39,668 --> 02:17:41,531
from here, from the launcher,

2353
02:17:41,531 --> 02:17:44,695
or you can right click and new notebook.

2354
02:17:46,097 --> 02:17:47,338
And it's a Python 3 notebook.

2355
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:50,543
I'll close the extra one.

2356
02:17:50,543 --> 02:17:51,825
It's untitled.

2357
02:17:51,825 --> 02:17:52,886
Okay.

2358
02:17:52,886 --> 02:17:56,391
Let's call it widget.ipynotebook.

2359
02:17:57,893 --> 02:17:58,133
Okay.

2360
02:18:00,356 --> 02:18:02,739
And if you're in the

2361
02:18:02,739 --> 02:18:04,962
Code Refiner environment, you have

2362
02:18:04,962 --> 02:18:06,825
the IPY widget installed.

2363
02:18:08,087 --> 02:18:09,068
So this should run.

2364
02:18:10,077 --> 02:18:11,820
It works.

2365
02:18:12,941 --> 02:18:14,323
Otherwise, you need to install

2366
02:18:14,323 --> 02:18:16,286
IPY widgets in your environment.

2367
02:18:17,628 --> 02:18:19,972
And then to use the widget,

2368
02:18:21,835 --> 02:18:23,257
we need to define a function.

2369
02:18:23,257 --> 02:18:24,999
So we'll give a function

2370
02:18:24,999 --> 02:18:26,802
with three arguments, X, Y, and S.

2371
02:18:28,244 --> 02:18:30,107
And it just returns X, Y, and

2372
02:18:30,107 --> 02:18:32,270
S. So it's a very simple function.

2373
02:18:32,270 --> 02:18:35,655
But the point is, we will

2374
02:18:35,655 --> 02:18:38,700
make a widget that allows you to change those

2375
02:18:39,558 --> 02:18:40,659
those arguments.

2376
02:18:40,659 --> 02:18:42,381
So we'll use the interact,

2377
02:18:44,042 --> 02:18:45,504
which is this one that we imported.

2378
02:18:47,646 --> 02:18:49,047
So the interact widget, we

2379
02:18:49,047 --> 02:18:50,709
give it the function as a

2380
02:18:50,709 --> 02:18:53,632
parameter, and then we give

2381
02:18:53,632 --> 02:18:55,714
initial values to the parameters.

2382
02:18:55,714 --> 02:18:59,798
So x equals true, y

2383
02:18:59,798 --> 02:19:03,661
equals, whoops, equals 1.0, okay,

2384
02:19:04,842 --> 02:19:09,376
comma, then s equals hello,

2385
02:19:09,376 --> 02:19:11,479
Okay, I managed to write it correctly.

2386
02:19:11,479 --> 02:19:12,200
Good.

2387
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:14,043
So now when we run this,

2388
02:19:14,043 --> 02:19:17,889
it will give some widgets that

2389
02:19:17,889 --> 02:19:20,173
you can use to adjust these parameters.

2390
02:19:20,173 --> 02:19:21,455
So X is true.

2391
02:19:21,455 --> 02:19:22,376
So it's a Boolean.

2392
02:19:22,376 --> 02:19:23,298
It's either yes or no.

2393
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:26,923
And this, by the way, this

2394
02:19:26,923 --> 02:19:28,646
part is the result of the function.

2395
02:19:28,646 --> 02:19:30,789
So it just returns the parameters.

2396
02:19:30,789 --> 02:19:31,911
So it looks like this.

2397
02:19:33,493 --> 02:19:34,555
But if you send it a

2398
02:19:34,555 --> 02:19:36,718
false, then it returns false.

2399
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:38,468
And otherwise, it returns true.

2400
02:19:38,468 --> 02:19:39,890
okay you can this is

2401
02:19:39,890 --> 02:19:41,472
a floating point number so you

2402
02:19:41,472 --> 02:19:45,818
can change the value and this

2403
02:19:45,818 --> 02:19:47,260
one is a string so it gives

2404
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:51,645
you a text box yeah so

2405
02:19:51,645 --> 02:19:53,107
essentially the widget is like

2406
02:19:53,107 --> 02:19:54,769
instead of like right changing the

2407
02:19:54,769 --> 02:19:57,893
code you can play with the pi parameters

2408
02:19:57,893 --> 02:20:01,478
and your ... the output

2409
02:20:01,478 --> 02:20:02,880
with some widgets and like some

2410
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:05,143
buttons so it essentially it

2411
02:20:05,143 --> 02:20:07,831
completely oh it runs the function

2412
02:20:07,831 --> 02:20:09,375
with those parameters and then

2413
02:20:09,375 --> 02:20:10,217
produces the results.

2414
02:20:10,217 --> 02:20:12,162
So you can, yeah, you can show different,

2415
02:20:13,545 --> 02:20:16,051
you can allow people to

2416
02:20:16,051 --> 02:20:17,635
interact with the code in

2417
02:20:17,635 --> 02:20:18,938
a more user-friendly way.

2418
02:20:20,690 --> 02:20:23,573
So let's do another example,

2419
02:20:23,573 --> 02:20:25,535
because we have a few minutes.

2420
02:20:25,535 --> 02:20:26,997
Maybe we can do the pi

2421
02:20:26,997 --> 02:20:28,539
one, actually, and, like, increase

2422
02:20:28,539 --> 02:20:31,742
the number of the... Yeah.

2423
02:20:31,742 --> 02:20:33,745
So this is actually, like,

2424
02:20:33,745 --> 02:20:35,927
essentially next in the... Well,

2425
02:20:35,927 --> 02:20:37,169
there's a few useful Magix

2426
02:20:37,169 --> 02:20:38,490
commands, and then there's the

2427
02:20:38,490 --> 02:20:40,012
playing around with the widget.

2428
02:20:40,012 --> 02:20:42,435
So I'll essentially copy the

2429
02:20:42,435 --> 02:20:43,336
code from there.

2430
02:20:46,659 --> 02:20:50,069
So we get the interact.

2431
02:20:50,069 --> 02:20:51,812
from widgets and we get

2432
02:20:51,812 --> 02:20:55,377
widgets from widgets, API widgets.

2433
02:20:55,377 --> 02:20:56,238
We also get random.

2434
02:20:58,181 --> 02:20:58,842
Okay, run that.

2435
02:21:00,444 --> 02:21:03,769
Actually, we also need matplotlib inline.

2436
02:21:04,591 --> 02:21:05,492
We'll put it in a different

2437
02:21:05,492 --> 02:21:11,681
cell so that we have this magic command on top.

2438
02:21:11,681 --> 02:21:12,603
I don't know if that matters.

2439
02:21:13,444 --> 02:21:13,744
It might.

2440
02:21:15,106 --> 02:21:16,377
Okay, and then

2441
02:21:16,377 --> 02:21:19,060
The rest is creating functions.

2442
02:21:20,481 --> 02:21:21,222
Place this one here.

2443
02:21:22,143 --> 02:21:24,726
So this is the throw darts, create plot

2444
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:27,148
and run the whole experiments,

2445
02:21:27,148 --> 02:21:28,710
which means first throw darts

2446
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:30,011
and then create the plot and

2447
02:21:30,011 --> 02:21:31,833
then print the value of pi.

2448
02:21:31,833 --> 02:21:34,256
So this is the exercise we just, well,

2449
02:21:34,256 --> 02:21:34,996
just did, we did an

2450
02:21:34,996 --> 02:21:39,121
hour ago that calculates the value of pi.

2451
02:21:40,662 --> 02:21:43,926
So we could run experiments

2452
02:21:43,926 --> 02:21:46,148
with a hundred points

2453
02:21:47,174 --> 02:21:50,118
or a thousand points and so on.

2454
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:52,782
So people can adjust it here,

2455
02:21:52,782 --> 02:21:55,786
but using a widget, it looks nicer.

2456
02:21:56,587 --> 02:22:00,052
So we previously used the interact widget,

2457
02:22:00,052 --> 02:22:02,556
the interact function, and we

2458
02:22:02,556 --> 02:22:05,640
can tell it the number of

2459
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:08,204
points equals give it starting value a hundred.

2460
02:22:09,266 --> 02:22:09,726
Okay.

2461
02:22:09,726 --> 02:22:10,888
And that gives you a nice widget.

2462
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:13,131
So

2463
02:22:16,064 --> 02:22:18,327
Did it actually run though?

2464
02:22:20,551 --> 02:22:21,572
I think it got an exception.

2465
02:22:21,572 --> 02:22:23,215
And do you have to run that?

2466
02:22:23,215 --> 02:22:23,495
Yeah.

2467
02:22:23,495 --> 02:22:23,855
OK.

2468
02:22:23,855 --> 02:22:24,957
Let's run that again.

2469
02:22:24,957 --> 02:22:26,199
Yes.

2470
02:22:26,199 --> 02:22:30,966
Because when it got 0, it got divided by 0.

2471
02:22:30,966 --> 02:22:31,186
Yeah.

2472
02:22:32,007 --> 02:22:34,571
So yeah, that is one of

2473
02:22:34,571 --> 02:22:35,753
the points of the exercise, that

2474
02:22:35,753 --> 02:22:37,836
there is a value that you

2475
02:22:37,836 --> 02:22:40,180
can slide to, but that you shouldn't use.

2476
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:44,802
But it doesn't redo the image, does it?

2477
02:22:44,802 --> 02:22:45,943
I'm adding a lot of points

2478
02:22:45,943 --> 02:22:48,166
and it's not re-running, re-creating the plot.

2479
02:22:50,088 --> 02:22:50,908
Oh, interesting.

2480
02:22:50,908 --> 02:22:52,370
Did you restart the kernel already?

2481
02:22:52,370 --> 02:22:53,671
Yes, I did.

2482
02:22:56,174 --> 02:22:57,876
Restart the kernel.

2483
02:22:57,876 --> 02:22:58,717
Restart, run.

2484
02:23:01,159 --> 02:23:02,040
Okay.

2485
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:03,962
Well, let's see what happens if

2486
02:23:03,962 --> 02:23:06,164
we make it an integer slider.

2487
02:23:06,164 --> 02:23:07,346
So this is why we

2488
02:23:08,987 --> 02:23:11,630
imported also these widgets because

2489
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:13,996
this gives a

2490
02:23:13,996 --> 02:23:15,678
gives us some control of

2491
02:23:15,678 --> 02:23:19,241
this number of points value.

2492
02:23:20,162 --> 02:23:23,484
So we get integer slider in slider.

2493
02:23:24,806 --> 02:23:26,307
And there we can give it

2494
02:23:26,307 --> 02:23:30,671
a minimum, let's say minimum is

2495
02:23:30,671 --> 02:23:33,894
100 points, we can say max

2496
02:23:33,894 --> 02:23:35,615
is what 10,000 points.

2497
02:23:37,797 --> 02:23:41,841
And we adjust it in steps of 100.

2498
02:23:42,862 --> 02:23:43,375
Yeah,

2499
02:23:43,375 --> 02:23:45,498
This is going off the page.

2500
02:23:45,498 --> 02:23:49,383
Add some line breaks.

2501
02:23:51,406 --> 02:23:51,667
Okay.

2502
02:23:52,568 --> 02:23:53,950
And then the starting value

2503
02:23:53,950 --> 02:23:56,974
is 1000 and it's again going off the page.

2504
02:23:58,116 --> 02:23:58,356
Fine.

2505
02:24:00,359 --> 02:24:01,580
It's not going off by that much.

2506
02:24:02,442 --> 02:24:03,984
We could also do it like this.

2507
02:24:06,127 --> 02:24:07,929
It looks a bit better and

2508
02:24:07,929 --> 02:24:09,612
now you can see everything.

2509
02:24:09,612 --> 02:24:09,872
Okay.

2510
02:24:11,725 --> 02:24:13,148
So when we run this, we

2511
02:24:13,148 --> 02:24:14,209
should get a better slider.

2512
02:24:14,209 --> 02:24:15,812
Oh, now actually the plot is better.

2513
02:24:18,156 --> 02:24:19,178
So you can adjust it.

2514
02:24:19,178 --> 02:24:19,379
No.

2515
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:20,541
No.

2516
02:24:22,204 --> 02:24:23,185
The plot is not changing.

2517
02:24:23,185 --> 02:24:24,167
Oh, OK.

2518
02:24:25,009 --> 02:24:25,509
I don't know why.

2519
02:24:26,351 --> 02:24:27,633
Weird.

2520
02:24:27,633 --> 02:24:28,114
That's weird.

2521
02:24:29,917 --> 02:24:31,439
Can you stop the JupyterLab

2522
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:32,299
and start it again?

2523
02:24:32,299 --> 02:24:33,801
Maybe that's the... Actually,

2524
02:24:33,801 --> 02:24:37,645
so the maximum value in the nodes is 10,000.

2525
02:24:37,645 --> 02:24:39,967
That is not going to

2526
02:24:39,967 --> 02:24:41,069
solve the plot problem.

2527
02:24:41,970 --> 02:24:44,412
Yeah, but I guess it's an

2528
02:24:44,412 --> 02:24:45,493
issue with the JupyterLab.

2529
02:24:45,493 --> 02:24:49,417
Can you maybe restart that as well?

2530
02:24:49,417 --> 02:24:50,679
Restart JupyterLab.

2531
02:24:50,679 --> 02:24:51,780
I can do that.

2532
02:24:53,522 --> 02:24:54,663
So I have it in a

2533
02:24:54,663 --> 02:24:57,726
terminal, so I'll just stop it from there.

2534
02:24:59,107 --> 02:24:59,788
Restart.

2535
02:25:02,266 --> 02:25:03,447
And it opens a new one.

2536
02:25:05,950 --> 02:25:06,070
Okay.

2537
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:07,412
I'll leave the previous one.

2538
02:25:07,412 --> 02:25:07,933
Okay.

2539
02:25:07,933 --> 02:25:10,015
And now we have this widget file here.

2540
02:25:12,138 --> 02:25:12,738
Okay.

2541
02:25:12,738 --> 02:25:14,220
And we can try running everything.

2542
02:25:18,425 --> 02:25:19,947
I mean, it's not that

2543
02:25:19,947 --> 02:25:22,510
bad if matplotlib doesn't work

2544
02:25:22,510 --> 02:25:24,832
perfectly with this, but it would

2545
02:25:24,832 --> 02:25:25,673
be nice to see.

2546
02:25:26,595 --> 02:25:28,036
There's one comment in the

2547
02:25:28,036 --> 02:25:31,260
notes about the inline command.

2548
02:25:33,147 --> 02:25:40,280
So restart and run.

2549
02:25:46,171 --> 02:25:47,553
Okay, that actually fixes it.

2550
02:25:48,435 --> 02:25:48,836
Interesting.

2551
02:25:48,836 --> 02:25:49,297
Okay.

2552
02:25:50,218 --> 02:25:50,659
Thank you.

2553
02:25:51,581 --> 02:25:52,643
So it works better without

2554
02:25:52,643 --> 02:25:54,707
the inline plots.

2555
02:25:54,707 --> 02:25:54,987
All right.

2556
02:25:59,776 --> 02:26:01,278
Okay, so yeah, that's something

2557
02:26:01,278 --> 02:26:02,098
to play around with.

2558
02:26:02,098 --> 02:26:03,840
That makes these pages

2559
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:07,044
even more interactive and easier to use

2560
02:26:07,044 --> 02:26:08,325
for someone that doesn't

2561
02:26:08,325 --> 02:26:12,329
actually write Python or any

2562
02:26:12,329 --> 02:26:13,551
other, or some other programming

2563
02:26:13,551 --> 02:26:14,332
language that you're using.

2564
02:26:15,733 --> 02:26:19,737
So there's also rshiny, which

2565
02:26:19,737 --> 02:26:21,539
I should, I can display this page.

2566
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:25,383
So rshiny is an alternative

2567
02:26:26,284 --> 02:26:29,003
similar to ipyewidgets for R.

2568
02:26:29,003 --> 02:26:29,844
notebooks.

2569
02:26:30,986 --> 02:26:31,887
And there's a gallery of

2570
02:26:31,887 --> 02:26:34,851
examples, nice ideas that you can look at.

2571
02:26:34,851 --> 02:26:37,094
There's also other useful things

2572
02:26:37,094 --> 02:26:37,876
here to look at.

2573
02:26:37,876 --> 02:26:42,742
I didn't actually prepare to

2574
02:26:42,742 --> 02:26:46,087
teach or check that they work on my system.

2575
02:26:46,087 --> 02:26:51,034
But we do have a bit of extra time,

2576
02:26:51,034 --> 02:26:52,516
we probably should just end

2577
02:26:52,516 --> 02:26:53,658
early because we don't have

2578
02:26:53,658 --> 02:26:55,180
that much extra time.

2579
02:26:57,455 --> 02:26:59,439
If you have a very good question

2580
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:01,963
or even not that not such a good question,

2581
02:27:01,963 --> 02:27:03,386
but something that's interesting

2582
02:27:03,386 --> 02:27:05,710
to ask, then please ask it in the notes.

2583
02:27:06,592 --> 02:27:07,394
I will.

2584
02:27:07,394 --> 02:27:07,734
Whoops.

2585
02:27:07,734 --> 02:27:08,556
What did I do?

2586
02:27:08,556 --> 02:27:08,776
Okay.

2587
02:27:10,319 --> 02:27:13,024
So I will move on to the summary page.

2588
02:27:14,066 --> 02:27:15,529
So in Jupyter Notebooks, we

2589
02:27:15,529 --> 02:27:20,037
have a summary page here and

2590
02:27:21,299 --> 02:27:23,422
Yeah, there's some recommendations

2591
02:27:23,422 --> 02:27:24,504
for longer notebooks.

2592
02:27:24,504 --> 02:27:26,206
We have a question regarding

2593
02:27:26,206 --> 02:27:29,391
the Jupyter rich diff on GitHub.

2594
02:27:29,391 --> 02:27:30,212
Can you show it again?

2595
02:27:30,212 --> 02:27:33,537
Yeah.

2596
02:27:33,537 --> 02:27:34,438
Oh, so the question is

2597
02:27:34,438 --> 02:27:36,281
essentially, can you show it again?

2598
02:27:38,303 --> 02:27:41,808
So do we have a good example?

2599
02:27:41,808 --> 02:27:43,311
I mean, we probably actually

2600
02:27:43,311 --> 02:27:49,480
have just in my own repositories,

2601
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:51,222
the last one should be

2602
02:27:52,079 --> 02:27:53,241
the pi_example.

2603
02:27:57,527 --> 02:28:00,792
And then let's update requirements.

2604
02:28:00,792 --> 02:28:04,677
Py, IPy-notebook, what's updated in this.

2605
02:28:04,677 --> 02:28:04,958
Okay.

2606
02:28:05,879 --> 02:28:08,423
So now we maybe have a diff of a notebook.

2607
02:28:09,484 --> 02:28:12,008
Can you show the feature again to see?

2608
02:28:12,008 --> 02:28:12,269
Yeah.

2609
02:28:13,591 --> 02:28:16,314
So it was here in feature preview.

2610
02:28:17,276 --> 02:28:18,958
There is this rich notebook diff.

2611
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:21,462
So if this is disabled...

2612
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:25,774
and I reload the page, then

2613
02:28:25,774 --> 02:28:28,937
the diff of the notebook doesn't look as nice.

2614
02:28:28,937 --> 02:28:30,559
Okay, now it doesn't show it at all.

2615
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:33,802
So now it's essentially, it

2616
02:28:33,802 --> 02:28:35,364
looks like the diff of the

2617
02:28:35,364 --> 02:28:37,786
text that's actually the notebook file.

2618
02:28:37,786 --> 02:28:39,969
So it's a text file.

2619
02:28:39,969 --> 02:28:42,011
It's a JSON text file.

2620
02:28:42,011 --> 02:28:44,954
So it's not that easy

2621
02:28:44,954 --> 02:28:46,135
to follow what's happening,

2622
02:28:46,135 --> 02:28:48,257
especially the images, again, quite horrible.

2623
02:28:49,759 --> 02:28:49,879
Yeah.

2624
02:28:51,597 --> 02:28:53,239
Somehow the old image is bigger

2625
02:28:53,239 --> 02:28:54,621
than the new one, even though

2626
02:28:54,621 --> 02:28:57,505
the new one has more points.

2627
02:28:58,406 --> 02:28:59,688
Oh, that was not the right button.

2628
02:29:01,210 --> 02:29:01,370
Okay.

2629
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:05,996
So let's go again to click the profile,

2630
02:29:05,996 --> 02:29:08,740
go to feature preview, and

2631
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:14,668
here you can enable rich Jupyter notebook diffs.

2632
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:21,356
and then the diffs of

2633
02:29:21,356 --> 02:29:25,863
Jupyter notebooks will look a lot better.

2634
02:29:25,863 --> 02:29:26,625
Okay, here we are.

2635
02:29:27,987 --> 02:29:29,049
So that's a lot clearer.

2636
02:29:32,715 --> 02:29:32,815
Okay.

2637
02:29:40,768 --> 02:29:42,053
Now...

2638
02:29:42,053 --> 02:29:43,634
This is the summary page that

2639
02:29:43,634 --> 02:29:44,415
I am already on.

2640
02:29:44,415 --> 02:29:47,078
Okay, so let's go through the summary.

2641
02:29:47,078 --> 02:29:48,919
For some reason, my doorbell is ringing.

2642
02:29:48,919 --> 02:29:52,223
It's ringing twice, so it

2643
02:29:52,223 --> 02:29:54,244
might be important, but let's

2644
02:29:54,244 --> 02:29:54,825
see what happens.

2645
02:29:58,388 --> 02:30:03,153
So, we have talked

2646
02:30:03,153 --> 02:30:04,394
about Jupyter, basically.

2647
02:30:04,394 --> 02:30:05,815
We've gone through some interesting

2648
02:30:05,815 --> 02:30:07,257
and useful features and there's

2649
02:30:07,257 --> 02:30:09,799
all sorts of things.

2650
02:30:12,445 --> 02:30:16,330
all sorts of details that make it useful.

2651
02:30:18,213 --> 02:30:19,935
Like the fact that you can

2652
02:30:19,935 --> 02:30:21,537
package it in a single file

2653
02:30:21,537 --> 02:30:22,739
and easily send it around.

2654
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:25,984
And also that it shows all

2655
02:30:25,984 --> 02:30:28,247
of the results very close to your code.

2656
02:30:28,247 --> 02:30:31,231
It's very good for documentation and so on.

2657
02:30:32,593 --> 02:30:36,478
And also those same things, partly,

2658
02:30:38,095 --> 02:30:40,679
they create some problems, like

2659
02:30:40,679 --> 02:30:41,861
the fact that you can execute

2660
02:30:41,861 --> 02:30:43,503
the cells out of order,

2661
02:30:43,503 --> 02:30:46,668
as things happen, sometimes in

2662
02:30:46,668 --> 02:30:50,174
unexpected ways, that are

2663
02:30:50,174 --> 02:30:52,177
important to remember.

2664
02:30:52,177 --> 02:30:53,519
And I mean, basically, they

2665
02:30:53,519 --> 02:30:54,741
will just cause problems, and

2666
02:30:54,741 --> 02:30:56,263
you will debug those problems.

2667
02:30:56,263 --> 02:31:00,470
And at some point, you will remember that,

2668
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:01,772
oh, well, maybe if I run

2669
02:31:01,772 --> 02:31:02,613
it from the beginning to the

2670
02:31:02,613 --> 02:31:04,035
end, and hopefully it will work and

2671
02:31:06,108 --> 02:31:07,130
It's also very easy to

2672
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:08,532
write a Jupyter notebook, but if

2673
02:31:08,532 --> 02:31:09,513
you run it from the beginning

2674
02:31:09,513 --> 02:31:11,096
to the end, it will not work.

2675
02:31:11,096 --> 02:31:14,120
So it's good to test that

2676
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:14,681
every now and then.

2677
02:31:17,065 --> 02:31:18,687
But yeah, then there's a

2678
02:31:18,687 --> 02:31:21,552
few, we went through a few

2679
02:31:21,552 --> 02:31:24,937
different ways of sharing notebooks and,

2680
02:31:28,903 --> 02:31:30,545
well, essentially we showed

2681
02:31:30,545 --> 02:31:32,228
the binder thing, but there's

2682
02:31:32,228 --> 02:31:35,116
plenty of other options, many different ways

2683
02:31:35,116 --> 02:31:37,979
of sharing them and sending them to people.

2684
02:31:37,979 --> 02:31:41,222
So yeah, I mean, it's one

2685
02:31:41,222 --> 02:31:45,145
of those, it's a very useful way of coding

2686
02:31:45,145 --> 02:31:47,988
and sharing code, but it also

2687
02:31:47,988 --> 02:31:50,610
has its own downsides, especially

2688
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:51,811
if your code gets longer,

2689
02:31:51,811 --> 02:31:53,273
then it's impossible to follow.

2690
02:31:54,274 --> 02:32:01,480
So is there anything you want

2691
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:03,402
to bring up specifically?

2692
02:32:06,554 --> 02:32:08,136
... I think everything was

2693
02:32:08,136 --> 02:32:09,859
everything was fine and ...

2694
02:32:09,859 --> 02:32:11,060
the main introduction was

2695
02:32:12,142 --> 02:32:15,386
why Jupyter notebooks could be useful

2696
02:32:15,386 --> 02:32:17,789
and why in some cases they

2697
02:32:17,789 --> 02:32:20,193
are not the best so but the best solution

2698
02:32:21,615 --> 02:32:26,121
so yeah yeah okay and of

2699
02:32:26,121 --> 02:32:27,603
course it's it's also important

2700
02:32:27,603 --> 02:32:28,624
to remember that there's other

2701
02:32:28,624 --> 02:32:31,782
options so there's ...

2702
02:32:31,782 --> 02:32:33,545
many different notebook alternatives,

2703
02:32:33,545 --> 02:32:34,646
even though we only

2704
02:32:34,646 --> 02:32:37,150
showed Jupyter notebooks and

2705
02:32:37,150 --> 02:32:38,012
for different languages.

2706
02:32:40,415 --> 02:32:43,780
And yeah, I mean, this is an example of,

2707
02:32:47,566 --> 02:32:48,788
well, partly the kind of

2708
02:32:48,788 --> 02:32:50,270
thing I was talking about

2709
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:52,213
where it gets complicated, but

2710
02:32:52,213 --> 02:32:57,742
also you can take, when your

2711
02:32:57,742 --> 02:32:59,865
code gets long and gets fancy,

2712
02:33:00,706 --> 02:33:02,609
You can start taking parts

2713
02:33:02,609 --> 02:33:03,770
out of the Jupyter notebook

2714
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:05,773
and putting them into your own module.

2715
02:33:06,654 --> 02:33:07,996
And that is essentially how

2716
02:33:08,877 --> 02:33:10,139
most modules are born in

2717
02:33:10,139 --> 02:33:14,385
scientific coding or scientific software.

2718
02:33:14,385 --> 02:33:16,087
So you start writing something

2719
02:33:16,087 --> 02:33:17,209
and you notice that it

2720
02:33:17,209 --> 02:33:21,378
starts getting complex enough that you want to

2721
02:33:21,378 --> 02:33:23,420
actually take functional pieces

2722
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:24,942
and make them independent,

2723
02:33:24,942 --> 02:33:25,583
make them modules.

2724
02:33:26,384 --> 02:33:29,608
So that's something we'll talk

2725
02:33:29,608 --> 02:33:31,890
more about in modular coding,

2726
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:32,912
but that's something that's

2727
02:33:32,912 --> 02:33:35,455
very, very important, very useful

2728
02:33:35,455 --> 02:33:37,978
for dealing with notebooks.

2729
02:33:42,403 --> 02:33:43,925
All right.

2730
02:33:43,925 --> 02:33:45,286
Thank you so much, [name]

2731
02:33:45,286 --> 02:33:47,209
and [name], for today's session.

2732
02:33:48,650 --> 02:33:51,013
I hope everyone who

2733
02:33:52,158 --> 02:33:54,461
watched and followed until the

2734
02:33:54,461 --> 02:33:56,203
end, got something out of this.

2735
02:33:57,704 --> 02:34:00,007
We have added a feedback

2736
02:34:00,007 --> 02:34:02,570
section in the very end of the notes.

2737
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:05,053
Maybe [name] can move there and show it.

2738
02:34:08,376 --> 02:34:09,237
So if you go to our

2739
02:34:09,237 --> 02:34:11,920
notes and then scroll all the

2740
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:17,133
way to the bottom, there's a small section

2741
02:34:17,133 --> 02:34:18,595
So next week, we will

2742
02:34:18,595 --> 02:34:21,140
actually be talking about automated

2743
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:22,642
testing and the week after

2744
02:34:22,642 --> 02:34:25,206
will be modular code development.

2745
02:34:25,206 --> 02:34:28,151
So if you have no idea what testing is

2746
02:34:28,151 --> 02:34:29,694
and how to run it, and especially

2747
02:34:29,694 --> 02:34:31,717
how to run it automatically,

2748
02:34:31,717 --> 02:34:34,982
next week is the time and day for that.

2749
02:34:36,665 --> 02:34:38,783
That basically means that

2750
02:34:38,783 --> 02:34:40,365
You will learn how you

2751
02:34:40,365 --> 02:34:42,306
may prevent yourself and others

2752
02:34:42,306 --> 02:34:43,588
from breaking your running code.

2753
02:34:44,869 --> 02:34:46,811
And we will have examples

2754
02:34:46,811 --> 02:34:48,032
in the lesson materials for

2755
02:34:48,032 --> 02:34:50,214
many different programming languages.

2756
02:34:50,214 --> 02:34:51,976
So even if you don't code

2757
02:34:51,976 --> 02:34:53,978
in Python, you might get

2758
02:34:53,978 --> 02:34:55,499
something out from that lesson.

2759
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:57,581
And then we are asking,

2760
02:34:57,581 --> 02:34:59,403
how was your feeling today

2761
02:34:59,403 --> 02:35:02,266
about the speed, about the level

2762
02:35:02,266 --> 02:35:05,089
of the lesson and the materials?

2763
02:35:05,089 --> 02:35:07,351
Did we go through things

2764
02:35:07,351 --> 02:35:09,125
too fast, too slow?

2765
02:35:09,125 --> 02:35:11,188
Did it feel too basic,

2766
02:35:11,188 --> 02:35:13,331
too advanced, or just right?

2767
02:35:14,813 --> 02:35:17,957
And also, do you feel like

2768
02:35:17,957 --> 02:35:19,399
you will have use for what

2769
02:35:19,399 --> 02:35:22,503
you learned today in your work?

2770
02:35:22,503 --> 02:35:23,625
In the very beginning, we

2771
02:35:23,625 --> 02:35:25,247
discussed briefly how [name] and

2772
02:35:25,247 --> 02:35:27,450
[name] also are using Jupyter

2773
02:35:27,450 --> 02:35:29,032
in their daily life as

2774
02:35:29,032 --> 02:35:30,234
research software engineers.

2775
02:35:31,435 --> 02:35:32,156
And then if you have

2776
02:35:32,156 --> 02:35:35,621
any specific things that you

2777
02:35:35,621 --> 02:35:38,251
liked about today, please let us know as well.

2778
02:35:38,251 --> 02:35:40,533
as well as if you have anything

2779
02:35:40,533 --> 02:35:43,396
that you think we should improve

2780
02:35:43,396 --> 02:35:44,478
for next time, because we

2781
02:35:44,478 --> 02:35:49,603
are running these workshops like twice a year.

2782
02:35:49,603 --> 02:35:53,147
So we always are curious on

2783
02:35:53,147 --> 02:35:58,853
what we can do better to make it most useful

2784
02:35:58,853 --> 02:36:00,354
for you as a researcher so

2785
02:36:00,354 --> 02:36:03,798
that you can now go home and

2786
02:36:04,659 --> 02:36:05,960
apply what you have learned

2787
02:36:05,960 --> 02:36:07,630
to your own workflow.

2788
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:09,552
That is, of course, the wish.

2789
02:36:12,355 --> 02:36:14,197
And with that, I think

2790
02:36:14,197 --> 02:36:16,179
from our side, everything is said.

2791
02:36:16,179 --> 02:36:22,285
Do you have any last words to share here?

2792
02:36:22,285 --> 02:36:31,875
Not from my side.

2793
02:36:31,875 --> 02:36:33,296
Yeah.

2794
02:36:33,296 --> 02:36:35,258
I mean, a lot of this is,

2795
02:36:36,875 --> 02:36:40,538
is relatively like, and if

2796
02:36:40,538 --> 02:36:41,619
you have already used

2797
02:36:41,619 --> 02:36:43,401
Jupyter Notebooks, especially like this is,

2798
02:36:44,202 --> 02:36:47,004
this lesson might be relatively low level,

2799
02:36:47,004 --> 02:36:48,666
but it is also something

2800
02:36:48,666 --> 02:36:53,010
where a good amount of the

2801
02:36:53,010 --> 02:36:56,333
mistakes and bugs that happen

2802
02:36:56,333 --> 02:36:58,255
actually happen because of Jupyter features.

2803
02:36:58,255 --> 02:37:00,977
So it's like when you

2804
02:37:00,977 --> 02:37:04,043
actually run into them, it's good that you have

2805
02:37:04,043 --> 02:37:05,765
some kind of memory like this

2806
02:37:05,765 --> 02:37:09,729
is a thing that I should check.

2807
02:37:09,729 --> 02:37:10,550
Yeah.

2808
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:12,872
And also know that the

2809
02:37:12,872 --> 02:37:15,535
materials will stay available where they are.

2810
02:37:15,535 --> 02:37:18,418
You are very welcome to share

2811
02:37:18,418 --> 02:37:22,522
it also with your colleagues or

2812
02:37:22,522 --> 02:37:24,244
come back to them later.

2813
02:37:24,244 --> 02:37:28,768
And maybe at this time, I

2814
02:37:28,768 --> 02:37:33,524
will also add the link to our chat.

2815
02:37:33,524 --> 02:37:36,347
So in case you are now

2816
02:37:36,347 --> 02:37:39,971
going out to work with these topics

2817
02:37:39,971 --> 02:37:42,894
or also other topics from the workshop

2818
02:37:42,894 --> 02:37:45,216
and you have any questions or

2819
02:37:45,216 --> 02:37:46,418
would like to ask something

2820
02:37:46,418 --> 02:37:48,640
more from the instructors, we're

2821
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:50,722
all usually hanging out in

2822
02:37:50,722 --> 02:37:53,825
the CodeRefinery Zulip chat where

2823
02:37:53,825 --> 02:37:55,347
you are very welcome to join.

2824
02:37:55,347 --> 02:37:57,049
We have there one channel

2825
02:37:57,049 --> 02:37:59,311
that is called Help where you

2826
02:37:59,311 --> 02:38:00,813
can post all your questions and

2827
02:38:00,813 --> 02:38:03,075
then you will have some

2828
02:38:03,916 --> 02:38:06,920
multitude of people happy to

2829
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:10,585
help you with especially topics

2830
02:38:10,585 --> 02:38:11,666
related to the workshop.

2831
02:38:19,878 --> 02:38:20,198
All right.

2832
02:38:21,219 --> 02:38:23,843
Then unless [name] has anything

2833
02:38:23,843 --> 02:38:25,806
else to share at this point,

2834
02:38:26,627 --> 02:38:28,750
I think we can close down the

2835
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:33,076
stream and hope to see you all again

2836
02:38:33,076 --> 02:38:35,239
next week same time same

2837
02:38:35,239 --> 02:38:37,423
place we'll again send an

2838
02:38:37,423 --> 02:38:39,366
email with preparations and when

2839
02:38:39,366 --> 02:38:44,734
the stream starts and have a good afternoon

2840
02:38:44,734 --> 02:38:45,916
or whatever time it is where

2841
02:38:45,916 --> 02:38:48,720
you are and rest of the week

2842
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:52,165
