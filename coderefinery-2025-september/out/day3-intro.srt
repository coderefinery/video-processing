1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,106
I got a PhD position offer, then a postdoc,

2
00:00:02,106 --> 00:00:03,268
and now at this position

3
00:00:03,268 --> 00:00:04,009
here in the research

4
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,571
software engineering group.

5
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:06,533
All right, interesting.

6
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,336
I wasn't planning to stay

7
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:09,858
here for much longer than I

8
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,120
never managed to leave.

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,962
Yeah, I've seen this so many times

10
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,486
that nobody's sometimes planning

11
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:18,030
where to go, but then they

12
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,412
end up there and they will

13
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:21,255
stay there maybe for the rest of their lives.

14
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:23,197
What about you, [name]?

15
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:24,940
How did you end up in terms of

16
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,752
Well, I came to University in TromsÃ¸

17
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:35,044
for doing a PhD and stuck around

18
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:36,107
and got hired to do

19
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:37,752
research software engineering and

20
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:38,795
high performance computing.

21
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,749
well this is really great so you

22
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:44,893
both kind of went there liked it there

23
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:47,096
but also on the other hand the people

24
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:48,658
who have been hiring you

25
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,860
they didn't want you to leave

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,642
because often you know we have the issue

27
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:54,666
that amazing doctoral doctoral

28
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,510
researchers they just leave because

29
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,212
they have a postdoc offer

30
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:00,874
somewhere else in the planet and

31
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,957
it's just lots of you know

32
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:06,120
knowledge and and clever people

33
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,122
that are leaving every time

34
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:09,082
that they finish but it's

35
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,785
good that some universities invest

36
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:12,966
and keep the people we try

37
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,268
to do the same sometimes at Aalto University

38
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,631
so in the icebreaker i see

39
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:21,814
some people are writing yeah no

40
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,716
need to sleep that's the superpower

41
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:28,359
you know we need to sleep

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,022
especially our brain needs need

43
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:32,423
sleep but also the body

44
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,502
Yeah, the any language, being

45
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:37,665
able to code speak in any

46
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,890
language, this is a very interesting one.

47
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,814
And I was watching the news

48
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:44,319
that they are planning, I don't know

49
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,722
if they are available, some

50
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:48,529
sort of like headphones, earphones

51
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:49,811
that you could, that would

52
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,455
do live translation.

53
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:52,677
so that you could talk

54
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,381
your language with anybody else

55
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,624
in talking another language and

56
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:00,108
they would live translate.

57
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,771
So if we talk about languages, not

58
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,493
yet programming languages, how

59
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:05,957
is your Norwegian, [name] and

60
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:07,720
[name], because I'm assuming you

61
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,304
are not native in Norway?

62
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:13,428
No, but I think Norwegian

63
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:14,991
is relatively easy to learn

64
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,293
if you speak German as a

65
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:16,974
native language and if you

66
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:17,515
speak English already.

67
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,399
So I guess I had an easier time than most.

68
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,611
Do you need to do

69
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,634
teaching or supporting Norwegian or

70
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,416
is it that you just do everything in English?

71
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:29,300
As a PhD student in postdoc,

72
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,342
I had to teach in Norwegian

73
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:31,123
in some bachelor class.

74
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:31,463
I see.

75
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,447
But I think it's easier in physics

76
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:35,709
than if it would be linguistics

77
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:37,711
or so because no one really cares

78
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,073
whether your Norwegian is perfect

79
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:39,794
as long as you're able

80
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,476
to communicate concepts.

81
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:42,819
Yeah.

82
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,502
In Finland, it's a bit

83
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:48,885
more challenging to learn the language.

84
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:51,247
I can do the very basics.

85
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,791
So [name], I noticed that you

86
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,574
had a little crash.

87
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:59,856
Yes, Zoom was being annoying.

88
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:01,117
All right.

89
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,901
Hopefully, it will not happen

90
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,601
during the stream.

91
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:07,903
If it happens, we know that

92
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,505
you will be back a few seconds after.

93
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,964
And eventually [name] can scream for help.

94
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:14,666
We're all here with our camera off.

95
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:16,848
Right.

96
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,530
Then there's another icebreaker,

97
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,732
an important one before we start,

98
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,494
which is in preparation for today,

99
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,456
unless you are part of

100
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:27,099
an in-person classroom, we have

101
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,483
open an access request, or we are asking you

102
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:31,764
if you have opened an

103
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:35,328
access request issue so that

104
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,989
basically we can see your

105
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,353
GitHub handle username and, um,

106
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:47,131
and what and yeah actually this

107
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:49,840
is a good point that streaming

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,406
i think is showing

109
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,605
It's not showing my screen yet.

110
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:57,510
Oh, it got switched, I guess.

111
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,892
My screen is the one

112
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,816
with the icebreakers, yeah.

113
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:03,441
Yeah, so it's also going

114
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:05,284
to break the screen share.

115
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,967
That's good to remember.

116
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:08,029
That's good.

117
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:08,710
Let me know if the

118
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,954
screen share doesn't work or

119
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:12,497
if it's not showing the right thing.

120
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:15,724
So I was just showing these icebreakers.

121
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,889
And yeah, basically just a reminder,

122
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,572
if you click the link that

123
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,296
is there, you can request for access.

124
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,703
And then you will get an

125
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,407
email from GitHub to say that

126
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:27,830
you have been invited to be

127
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,215
a collaborator in this Git repository.

128
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,016
and then you need to

129
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:33,240
accept the invitation so it's

130
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,863
not enough just to request you

131
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:35,904
also need to wait for the

132
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,928
email and accept it and as

133
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:40,091
you know sometimes it might go to spam folder

134
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:42,475
or something like that so please check

135
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,078
and double check and we

136
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,820
will be checking this throughout the

137
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,107
day so if you see that you

138
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:53,172
don't have access or if you

139
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:56,017
are not sure just ask

140
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:57,559
All right, we have a couple

141
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,300
of minutes to go.

142
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,046
And anything else you want to say,

143
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,008
[name] and [name], before

144
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:06,909
we actually start?

145
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:10,894
Are you excited?

146
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:13,477
I am.

147
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:14,999
I think this is the most fun

148
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,040
day out of the course.

149
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:21,026
This is really the best day.

150
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,347
This is where you clearly see

151
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:24,249
the power of everything.

152
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:24,910
I know it.

153
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,907
how it joins together oh
