1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,684
And [name] quite kindly introduced

2
00:00:02,684 --> 00:00:05,246
us as like experts of HPC, etc.

3
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:06,828
But today we are going to

4
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:09,051
come to you as fellow learners.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,552
You know, we use Git and

6
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,393
we would like to share

7
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:14,016
some experience that might be useful for you.

8
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:16,782
So we kind of portray

9
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:19,648
as mutual learning experience rather

10
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:20,931
than like we teach and you

11
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,436
have to study everything and go for exam.

12
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:27,384
But it's just try to get something from us.

13
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:31,534
The first part of the lesson is

14
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:32,836
that we're going to have

15
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:35,099
some motivation about Git, why

16
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:39,366
we sort of selected this technology

17
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,970
and why we are going to talk about it.

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,372
After that, [name] would come

19
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:46,497
with the basic part of the

20
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,680
browsing, and then we'll go for a break.

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,606
And then the next part would start.

22
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,731
So I will start with the motivation.

23
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,353
and the human the material

24
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:58,794
i'm following is already there

25
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:02,838
in the internet okay yeah yeah

26
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:04,519
could could you point out where

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,522
i can find it so yes so uh you could uh

28
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:09,224
so the the easiest way to

29
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:11,386
find out is uh from if you

30
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:12,587
got an email from with

31
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:13,748
the shared document there's a

32
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:15,490
link in this document but that

33
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,010
is only for the

34
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,232
registered participants otherwise if

35
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:19,814
you really really get lost you

36
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,076
could go to code refinery

37
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,304
And you could go for

38
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:32,660
workshops or events and upcoming events here.

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,415
And then code refinery workshops online.

40
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:37,736
Okay.

41
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,266
And then I recommend that

42
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,569
we bookmark this so we can come back to this.

43
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,851
So this is the place where I am.

44
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:45,692
And I'm only going to

45
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:47,173
show things already here.

46
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,457
I'm not going to show anything extra.

47
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,600
But if I type, if I had to type,

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,041
for example, when answering a question

49
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,202
that something extra, we have

50
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:57,463
to transfer it to the

51
00:01:57,463 --> 00:02:00,927
shared document so people will not get lost.

52
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:01,207
Okay.

53
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,109
Sounds good.

54
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,489
Sounds good?

55
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,630
Yep.

56
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,871
Yes.

57
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,233
So then let's go for the motivation part.

58
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,751
So, the motivation for using Git

59
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,198
is to keep track of changes.

60
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,844
So, the Indrika was talking

61
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:18,685
about this time machine.

62
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,351
So, this is a code time machine.

63
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:25,239
When you develop code, you

64
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,978
can keep snapshots of different stages.

65
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:32,444
and go back to a past stage

66
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,635
if you need, if you keep track of this.

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,307
For this, do you use Git as well, [name]?

68
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,894
And could you briefly mention

69
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,250
how you use it?

70
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,133
Yeah, actually, I mostly use

71
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,557
the Git for writing some codes.

72
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,781
You know, it's like, for suppose,

73
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,064
if I want to add,

74
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,890
contribute to some existing code,

75
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,032
so I just clone the

76
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:00,296
code, take the repository and

77
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:03,041
add some features, maybe test it

78
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,365
and then like try to push it back.

79
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:07,068
So, this is all, like, I

80
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,391
would like to contribute.

81
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:11,798
Basically, it's, like, and sometimes

82
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:14,283
if I also want to, like,

83
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,949
keep track of some documents, so

84
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,414
I also use it for keeping track of that.

85
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:20,556
Okay.

86
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:21,598
How about you, like...

87
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:22,159
Yeah.

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,302
So I also, when I'm developing a code,

89
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:27,546
instead of keeping copies of folders,

90
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:30,249
for example, the code in

91
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:33,113
May, code in April, code in June, you know,

92
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,155
some sort of my own

93
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,758
version control system, I use Git

94
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,880
so I can keep track and I

95
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,802
can also work with collaborators.

96
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,504
So different people can work

97
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,167
on the same code base without

98
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,809
stepping on each other's toes

99
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,751
and then combine the work.

100
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,232
So we can

101
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,615
We'll talk about all those things.

102
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,237
First thing I will show

103
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:52,999
is this example repository to

104
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,163
show this snapshot feature.

105
00:03:57,044 --> 00:04:00,448
So the snapshot feature is that Git,

106
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:02,530
by the way, I start

107
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,232
using version control with

108
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:05,414
something called subversion.

109
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:06,855
So Git is not the

110
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:10,139
only version control system that's around,

111
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,241
but it's the most popular

112
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,944
and most convenient and most integrated one.

113
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,666
So that's why we are talking.

114
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,032
um and now this code is hosted on github

115
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,958
so code refinery we are

116
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,961
not promoting github as as a company

117
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:25,885
so we are showing github

118
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,307
because it's the most popular

119
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,832
and there's high chance that

120
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,515
you'll interact with github than

121
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:36,024
any other services in my personal

122
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:38,717
life i use more gitlab

123
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:43,301
because we have hosted our own GitLab.

124
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,362
But here we are showing

125
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,923
this because this is the

126
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:48,325
most likely interface that you

127
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,287
will interact with.

128
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:53,169
So here, [name], this is a

129
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:57,113
history of a single file here, run.py.

130
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,555
And if I scroll slowly

131
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:03,018
downwards to see where it was first created.

132
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:05,640
So this was created in 2016

133
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,738
by a person called Bast.

134
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,820
And then there is some

135
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,024
identifier for that version.

136
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,406
And then there are some links here.

137
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,489
So first thing I want to

138
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,932
mention here is that this

139
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,376
detail about this file is

140
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:29,459
in context with everything else around it.

141
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,022
So this is not just this

142
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,424
snapshot of that file, but a

143
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:37,007
snapshot of the entire code base

144
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,796
The time this was, we call

145
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,979
in Git, we call it the commit was made.

146
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,081
That's interesting.

147
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:45,582
Yes.

148
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:47,625
So do you know why, I

149
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,068
mean, there is this cryptic

150
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,250
identifier, FF48 something.

151
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:54,934
Do you know why it is

152
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,936
like not numbers, like integers,

153
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,118
like one, two, three?

154
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,820
Do you see the advantage of this?

155
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,141
Or do you know why this,

156
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:02,523
because we'll see this, we'll be

157
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:03,264
seeing this a lot.

158
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,486
Yeah, I think it's a

159
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:10,332
unique identifier or something like that.

160
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:10,572
Yes.

161
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,977
That's a unique generated identifier.

162
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,740
This also comes with the fact

163
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,302
that Git is a distributed

164
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,805
version control system that we'll

165
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,848
mention a little later in this lesson,

166
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,310
which means that if you

167
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,933
modify the same file in

168
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,475
the same repository, you'll get

169
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:28,518
a unique identifier yourself.

170
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,659
And if I do it, I'll

171
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,442
get a different identifier.

172
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:32,804
which makes it easier to

173
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,866
combine things later because Git

174
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,848
would know unambiguously how to

175
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,290
do the combination.

176
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,212
And also this identifier would say

177
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,634
that which copy was used

178
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,036
before the identification.

179
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:44,917
We call it the parent.

180
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:47,780
So all this information are

181
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,043
put together through an algorithm

182
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,144
and this is a generator.

183
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,147
So it's a generated uniform identifier.

184
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,551
And then if I click that here,

185
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,117
I go to a page.

186
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,580
Where should I click?

187
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,944
So I clicked on the hash.

188
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:08,131
So I will show you again.

189
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:11,678
So here, you see this identify here?

190
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:12,379
Yeah, I see that.

191
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:14,764
By clicking it, I can

192
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:18,391
get more details about that snapshot.

193
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:18,962
Okay.

194
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:21,165
So as you can see, there are three files.

195
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,528
So this init file, the runpy,

196
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,331
and then there's another file,

197
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,513
which is ugly.py.

198
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,556
So this is a snapshot of

199
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:32,480
the three changes in one snapshot.

200
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,022
And this is the first

201
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,145
commit in GitSense data, the

202
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:37,847
first recorded history that this

203
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,750
file was introduced to this repository.

204
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:45,709
So we get that information by this hash.

205
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,774
So this is the sort of advantage for,

206
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,637
let's say, if I want to,

207
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,721
if I do some change here,

208
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,624
like in 2022, they have done

209
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,868
some change and something broke.

210
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,213
Let's say a test fails.

211
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:01,960
Okay.

212
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,562
Then what we can do is we

213
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:06,526
can go to the previous version.

214
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:09,129
Here it says view code at this point.

215
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,372
So when I click that, it will

216
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:12,533
not go to the code itself,

217
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:14,816
but the snapshot of the

218
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,198
repository, all the files.

219
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:20,343
So if I click that, then I

220
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:24,328
go to the file at that point,

221
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,790
and I could run this file.

222
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:30,380
and see not only the

223
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,623
snapshot would include not only that file,

224
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:35,187
but the other files as well,

225
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:36,889
if there's a change and we

226
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,833
could run this and see whether test passes.

227
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:43,258
Would that make sense?

228
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,340
So could you explain, do

229
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,061
you want to explain a little

230
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:47,100
bit more what I said a little bit?

231
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,405
yeah basically i think uh

232
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:52,731
you are uh looking at this run.py

233
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,936
and just uh looking at

234
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:56,539
the timestamps basically it's like

235
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,442
when it is created when

236
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,847
someone modified it a bit and

237
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:03,052
then when you try to like uh

238
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,456
push it back there are like uh

239
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,789
some checks to be done like a

240
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,871
Yes.

241
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:10,414
So if something breaks, you can

242
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:12,197
go back and test it.

243
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,005
And then also you could take

244
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:16,846
only parts of it.

245
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:19,932
In the first, the example

246
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:20,593
I showed that there were

247
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,299
three files here modified.

248
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,930
You could take parts that were like

249
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,436
replace the broken parts, for example.

250
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,901
So basically you can time travel back.

251
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:31,202
Yes.

252
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,324
Okay.

253
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:34,228
Yeah, yeah.

254
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,872
So here, today we'll be

255
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,476
working on the browser.

256
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,558
So the web browser, all you

257
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,783
need is a web browser and a GitHub account.

258
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,184
But normally, if you use a

259
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:49,909
lot of coding, you would not

260
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,092
follow a workflow like this.

261
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,934
But for example, I use

262
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:57,899
the terminal for this kind of work.

263
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,181
And most people, they

264
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,525
use integrated development environment,

265
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,557
VS Code and et cetera.

266
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,381
But the reason that we are

267
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:09,669
showing today on the browser is

268
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,914
that on the first day, we

269
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,858
would like everybody to get

270
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,883
on board, even people who has never

271
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,542
seen Git before.

272
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,805
So we minimize the amount

273
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,087
of things like terminal.

274
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,489
If people are very much

275
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,811
used to Windows environments, they

276
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,134
might not be very familiar with the terminal.

277
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,957
So we remove all the extra

278
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:30,700
stuff that you need to know

279
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,382
in order to understand Git.

280
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,804
And we narrow down only

281
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:35,226
on the Git concepts.

282
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:38,210
And we'll talk today, you and me, all day.

283
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:40,854
And try to understand that concept.

284
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:42,076
And then in the next

285
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:45,293
days, the concepts will be transferable.

286
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,616
So this is an example.

287
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:47,759
So this is how it would

288
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,683
look like on a terminal.

289
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:50,926
So there's a commit with

290
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:54,213
a hash, the author, the author's email,

291
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,777
and the date, and a short

292
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:58,623
log message of what has happened.

293
00:10:58,623 --> 00:10:59,746
So [name], what is the

294
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,189
difference between this one and

295
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,771
the one you showed before, like the

296
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:04,392
Yes.

297
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:06,816
So this is the one, as we

298
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,899
see it on the web browser, on the internet.

299
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,441
So this is the, we can

300
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:13,246
call it the cloud, GitHub cloud.

301
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,868
And you can also do it

302
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,411
on your local computer, on your terminal.

303
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,953
You can download it on

304
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:21,218
your terminal and then look at it.

305
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:24,503
So we used, tomorrow we'll

306
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:27,109
use terms like pool, push,

307
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,611
Um, so this being, this

308
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:31,576
is like uploading and downloading,

309
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,779
but in Git, when you do this pool push,

310
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,001
the difference between upload

311
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,483
download is that it will

312
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,766
only download or upload the differences.

313
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,008
It will not download, upload

314
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,450
the entire thing back and forth.

315
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:45,236
Uh, so this terminal, we have pulled it,

316
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:47,239
you know, you mean, uh, I mean, um,

317
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,202
it, uh, download it to a computer

318
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:50,263
and we can have a look

319
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:51,465
at it and, but you'll, you'll

320
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,528
see the same concepts here as well.

321
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:56,590
Um,

322
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,613
We already talked much about, you know,

323
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:02,499
why we kind of need track to keep track,

324
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:04,962
like something is broken, you

325
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:07,446
know, what version that we were talking about.

326
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,349
We saw that there's a timestamp

327
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,933
and we saw that there's a unique identifier.

328
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,635
We can go back and check

329
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:14,957
and there's some versioning, you

330
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,301
know, we could unambiguously

331
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,163
refer to something, you know,

332
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:20,546
this is the version that

333
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,629
worked without, you know, sending

334
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:24,251
a folder, for example.

335
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,710
And then when there's especially a bug,

336
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,814
like something is broken, you

337
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,262
can find out where it was broken.

338
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,308
You know, when it was

339
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,736
broken, what broke it?

340
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,903
And then you could...

341
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,144
go to the, go to the

342
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:42,488
point where it was last worked

343
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:43,890
and then figure out more things.

344
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:45,653
Um, yes.

345
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,619
Uh, and also there is this, um, I mean,

346
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,841
if you look, if you, this

347
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:52,464
is about, you know, somebody,

348
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,168
um, wrote a thesis, but I had to, um,

349
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:56,611
give an advanced warning that,

350
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,054
you know, the Git word works with simple text.

351
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,121
Uh, do, can you explain

352
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,085
what simple text is?

353
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:11,477
It's maybe mostly like text

354
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,122
files like TXT or like this

355
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:15,445
kind of extensions, or you can

356
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,408
also use some LaTeX.

357
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:18,030
Yeah.

358
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,718
And may not be like, how about DocX?

359
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,105
Does it work like DocX or PPT?

360
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:26,145
No.

361
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:29,609
So the Git works best when

362
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,791
what you see and what your

363
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,713
computer sees is the same.

364
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,515
For example, if you have a docs file,

365
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:38,260
LibreOffice or Microsoft or Google Doc

366
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,483
or whatever, when you bold

367
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:41,624
the text, for example, there's

368
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:43,426
a lot of metadata behind.

369
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,449
So the actual text, what you

370
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,031
see and what's on the

371
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:48,927
computer is very different.

372
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,551
So even if you change one

373
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:51,833
text or if you make a text

374
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,096
bold, it will change a lot.

375
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,784
So it's difficult to track changes.

376
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:58,949
So if you have a thesis, for example,

377
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,234
so this means that it's not a PDF

378
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,998
or a Word document or a

379
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:06,545
kind of document format with a

380
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,480
lot of metadata, but it's plain text.

381
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,384
For example, the document we see here,

382
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,150
the markdown document, it's easy

383
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,772
to version control this.

384
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,076
You can version control this document.

385
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,199
Okay.

386
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,985
Is there any limit on how

387
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:27,607
many files I can share?

388
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:32,101
Yeah, so there could be some

389
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:34,244
limits in the server side, but

390
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:40,913
Git, it works, it's not for very large files.

391
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,297
It's for like code, computer code.

392
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,521
But if you learn Git, then

393
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:51,526
you can use other technology

394
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,270
which uses Git terminology and

395
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,713
Git techniques to version control.

396
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:58,675
For example, if you are

397
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,096
in machine learning, for example,

398
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,078
you might use this hugging face.

399
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:03,259
Yeah.

400
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,281
They have like big models.

401
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:06,622
And now the latest version

402
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,424
of the hugging face use

403
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,465
something similar to Git.

404
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:13,088
It's like XGit or something.

405
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,229
So you can use the Git,

406
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:15,850
add Git, all the commands we

407
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,732
use, but with big data.

408
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:19,954
So conceptually, it's the same.

409
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:21,275
But this Git we are

410
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,737
talking today is focused on

411
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:25,859
plain text, smaller files, larger

412
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:26,700
files are okay.

413
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,762
But for smaller plain text,

414
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,686
you'll keep repositories.

415
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:32,547
Not for data.

416
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:33,908
Okay.

417
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:34,909
I mean, data in the sense

418
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,351
there could be like smaller data files.

419
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,392
That's something different.

420
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,274
But let's say terabytes of

421
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:42,117
data is not version control in this way.

422
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:42,978
But for that, you have

423
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:45,901
Git LFS, for example, Git large file.

424
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,324
And then the version that

425
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,086
the hugging phase is using.

426
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,307
And there are other technologies.

427
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,909
But if you know the concepts

428
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:56,822
of Git, you can also use those setups.

429
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,428
Okay.

430
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:01,552
And then another thing, [name], is

431
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:02,775
that I said like

432
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,279
collaborative virtual control.

433
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,062
Let's say there is code.

434
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,686
There is, let's say, a web interface.

435
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,951
Here we are showing with a cartoon with,

436
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:10,953
we want to try out a

437
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,517
sunglass and a hat, and we

438
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,862
want to decide which one to use.

439
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:17,166
Let's say you are implementing

440
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,069
the sunglass part of it,

441
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,493
and I'm implementing the hat part of it.

442
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:22,695
And we can independently,

443
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:24,277
without stepping on each other's toe,

444
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,279
we can do a test and we

445
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,302
can check, and then we can

446
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:29,165
collaborate to see what's good.

447
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,310
And then we can combine at the end.

448
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,653
without affecting the main

449
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:38,544
line of development so um the the code

450
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:39,847
that works will remain and

451
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,611
users will use it while that's

452
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:43,596
happening we can have our own

453
00:16:43,596 --> 00:16:46,061
uh i wouldn't call it like

454
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:49,489
a full copies but but the

455
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:52,092
Because when you create a

456
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:54,054
branch, you don't actually

457
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,456
make multiple copies.

458
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,358
You just have some pointers to this.

459
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,301
Then you can experiment.

460
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,303
And then at the end, we can combine.

461
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,504
Or maybe we can throw away

462
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,306
the hat and then keep the sunglass.

463
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:06,249
We call this merging.

464
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:07,971
So we can come together at

465
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:10,053
some point to make a consensus

466
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,955
and then combine the code.

467
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:12,837
Okay.

468
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:14,298
Yeah, we will talk more about this later.

469
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,341
Do you have anything more

470
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:18,025
to mention about this, Iman?

471
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,607
No, nothing much.

472
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,755
So then we have the graph

473
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,418
that I can show you a little bit.

474
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:30,985
So how the development works.

475
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:32,627
I hope the screen is good enough.

476
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:35,151
If not, colleagues, please give me a shout.

477
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,755
So different people have made

478
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,259
branches and they did some development.

479
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,781
And the arrow pointing to

480
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:43,003
the black one means that

481
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:45,664
They have brought in the

482
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,786
changes to the main branch.

483
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:50,170
So the main branch would have that change.

484
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,672
So you can branch out and

485
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,933
branch in and merge.

486
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,778
So this is like adding the sunglasses.

487
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,341
Yes.

488
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,262
Correct.

489
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,323
So this will be like the green.

490
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:03,768
If they check the sunglass, it's good.

491
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:05,330
Now the main code has

492
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,832
that sunglass feature.

493
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:06,932
Okay.

494
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,996
And also the reproducibility,

495
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,299
which means that, let's say,

496
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,262
if you publish a paper today

497
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,764
with a certain code that works

498
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,546
with a certain set of data,

499
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:19,408
and then you can, in the

500
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,891
paper, you can mention that I use this version.

501
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:25,096
So after the paper is published, two

502
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:26,979
or three years in the future,

503
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,581
you did some modifications and

504
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:30,383
it's not the same thing, then

505
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:31,805
you don't have to worry about

506
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,167
looking for what worked.

507
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,069
You can point out, you

508
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,412
know, our paper talks about this version.

509
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,162
Here also we have an

510
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:46,511
example that shows something called git blame.

511
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:48,094
So the blame is not

512
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,856
necessarily to blame somebody

513
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,360
for something they did.

514
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,721
Savit, could you zoom in?

515
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:55,224
Yes, yes.

516
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:59,329
Let me make it a little bigger.

517
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:01,713
Would that be okay?

518
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:02,614
Yeah, this is good.

519
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:02,987
Yeah.

520
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:06,273
So no need to read the fine text here.

521
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,114
What I want to show is

522
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:09,939
that each line is annotated with

523
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,041
who did what when.

524
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,426
So we can get help from

525
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,389
that person, why you did that

526
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,651
change, and we can get help

527
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:19,476
from that person to get more details.

528
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:21,861
So Git records all this line by line.

529
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:25,768
So another thing is that Git

530
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,289
Actually, it version code was

531
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,491
like lines, not like text by text.

532
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,933
So you could mention which

533
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,076
line was modified by whom and when.

534
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:40,461
Apart from that, you could mention, like

535
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:42,363
if you want to send a part

536
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:44,345
of a code to somebody else,

537
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:48,388
you could, I'll close this additional windows.

538
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,072
You could send a link.

539
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:53,967
So this permanent link.

540
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:56,531
do you use permanent links uh

541
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:59,265
can't i send the file itself like uh

542
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,326
Yes.

543
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,588
I mean, that's a very good point.

544
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:02,929
You could send the file, then

545
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,111
you have to write a lot

546
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,432
of text about, you know, you

547
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,956
have to look, I'm sending this

548
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,039
file and I'm referring to line 40 to 44.

549
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,401
But if you send a link

550
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:14,203
like this, it highlights and

551
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,346
it shows unambiguously, this is

552
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:17,127
what I'm talking about.

553
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,229
They can copy and this code

554
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,951
is in a way that, you know, let's say

555
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,233
if you type this in an

556
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,156
email, for example, it might not be aligned.

557
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,058
You know, especially if like

558
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,199
Python script, for example, you

559
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,948
might not be able to

560
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:29,949
make it work sometimes.

561
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,797
And also email, some email,

562
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,963
like firewalls, for example, might block code.

563
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,169
All this could be avoided by this.

564
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,532
The way to generate a link is

565
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,816
that you go to the place where the code is,

566
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,278
you click that, and you

567
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:54,285
click this, the three dots, and

568
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,388
you can get a permanent link.

569
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,282
Okay.

570
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,706
If you want multiple lines,

571
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,091
you can click this.

572
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,320
Hold that shift key on the keyboard.

573
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,702
Okay.

574
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:04,664
And then you can get a

575
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,212
range for a permanent link.

576
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:08,015
Nice.

577
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:08,135
Right.

578
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:13,097
Typically, we take snapshots

579
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,818
of software scripts, as we

580
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:17,621
mentioned, not complicated metadata

581
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,185
included documents, even images.

582
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:23,027
You could make versions of images,

583
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:26,391
but the Git works best when

584
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:29,875
the text is plain text.

585
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,096
We have some discussion here.

586
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,098
Our learners are also welcome

587
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:35,706
to contribute in the shared document.

588
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:37,329
um so we see that there

589
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,491
are somebody who's trying to

590
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:39,994
version control i mean invent

591
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,780
a new version control system um

592
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,804
create a folder with the specific date

593
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,288
and make a copy do some modifications

594
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:49,693
and create another folder yeah

595
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:51,136
what is the issue with this

596
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:52,599
so i think they are also

597
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,182
doing the time stamping right

598
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,887
here like they're keeping track of the files it

599
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,837
Yes, but I mean, let's say

600
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:03,041
if they want to combine 2020, some file

601
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,926
and 2023, some file, that will

602
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:07,729
not be very obvious how to do it.

603
00:22:09,332 --> 00:22:11,276
And also like maybe they

604
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:12,558
had to uncompress it, look for

605
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:14,582
the file, and there's no

606
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,305
metadata associated with it.

607
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:19,992
Like line by line annotation,

608
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:22,416
like who did what was changed.

609
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,498
That kind of things.

610
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:27,063
And it's not easy to go and, I mean,

611
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:28,826
the timestamp is there, but

612
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:30,869
maybe the 2024 February folder

613
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:35,135
has some file that was changed on February,

614
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,179
the last day on maybe some

615
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,841
files on March 1st, but all

616
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:41,025
these things are in the February folder.

617
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:43,468
We don't want to keep that

618
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:44,330
track in this way.

619
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:48,897
You could also mention more

620
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:51,306
details in the shared documents if you wish.

621
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,509
And also we would like to

622
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,412
point out some issues with

623
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,333
version control as well.

624
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:59,297
You need to learn some things

625
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:02,182
like Git, the things we teach you.

626
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,323
But if you can manage the

627
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:04,685
first part of Code Refinery,

628
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:05,707
I think you're more than

629
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:08,370
equipped to start using Git.

630
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,651
Okay.

631
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:11,255
So that's something you get

632
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:14,059
from this class is that you

633
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,921
can learn more later on as you needed.

634
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:18,545
But today we'll get started.

635
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:22,056
Sometimes collaborators, they don't

636
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,198
like to use version control.

637
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,904
Personally, I have never encountered it.

638
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,006
There was instances where there

639
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,070
was some resistance, but at the

640
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,055
end, when we see the benefits,

641
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:35,018
they start using it.

642
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,464
Even if they don't use it,

643
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,128
we could use version control.

644
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,472
And then, for example, for

645
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,275
this repository that we are talking about,

646
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,635
collaborator could download a

647
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,617
compressed file if they wish but

648
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,599
we can still use you know

649
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,680
this could be like kind

650
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,663
of one-way um contribution but

651
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:58,585
you know it's possible to share it

652
00:23:58,585 --> 00:23:59,646
if somebody don't want to use

653
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,610
gift at all okay um so you know the the

654
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,731
when i move windows is it

655
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:06,693
too fast for the streaming or

656
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:09,236
is it okay all right so it

657
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:11,458
seems okay for me like okay

658
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,760
let's see the document

659
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,216
Then by Git, not something

660
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,059
else, it's easy to use.

661
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,023
As we slightly mentioned,

662
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:22,824
it's very popular.

663
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:26,430
You might encounter it at some point.

664
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:29,315
And also if you learn Git,

665
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:32,200
you can use GitLab, Bitbucket,

666
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,025
and GitHub interchangeably.

667
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,527
If the code is in Git,

668
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:38,226
you can transfer the Git.

669
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,248
But the issues and other

670
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:42,931
additional things might not be transferable.

671
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,372
But if you start using any

672
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:46,074
of this, it's easier to

673
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:48,096
move to another platform.

674
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:51,679
That's all I want to

675
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,202
introduce during motivation, [name].

676
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,263
I'll just have a look

677
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:56,384
at the shared document to

678
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:58,266
see whether there's any interesting questions.

679
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,088
Until you set up your

680
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:02,510
screen and inform [name] that

681
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,471
you're going to share it.

682
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:06,714
OK.

683
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:09,764
Yeah, this is about in general.

684
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:14,110
Yeah, the conda environments and all,

685
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,512
please do that after the

686
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:17,355
workshop, today's workshop, so then

687
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:18,657
you can be prepared.

688
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,363
Okay, I think [name] managed

689
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:26,287
to make it bigger without me making it,

690
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:28,210
but please [name] and [name]

691
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,832
and [name], please inform us if

692
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:30,553
we had to do something.

693
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:35,420
How the change are marked?

694
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,443
There are some color code.

695
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,995
Yeah, I think it's all covered.

696
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:47,321
Yeah, so they ask about the size.

697
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:48,763
Our collaborators have mentioned

698
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:52,388
there's some size or limitations,

699
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,832
but if you learn how to

700
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:55,994
use Git, you can use the

701
00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:58,337
same commands to control it.

702
00:25:58,337 --> 00:25:58,838
Yes.

703
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,363
I'm switching the size to

704
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:04,356
be correct, but yeah, I...

705
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,139
cannot select which uh screen

706
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:07,821
share is showing so it was uh him

707
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:09,103
and screenshot now it's zapris

708
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:13,390
okay maybe in any case go

709
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,873
ahead and yeah can you zoom in

710
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,998
a bit more i don't see

711
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:20,500
my screen on the streaming at

712
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:29,280
least is it now human only yes okay

713
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,201
okay hey man can you go

714
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,423
through the things because it's

715
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,605
already shared um yeah question nine

716
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,528
for example yeah i will go

717
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,971
through i will just need to

718
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,796
change a few things but give me

719
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:45,020
a second so can you see the

720
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:51,347
okay i can see the edit mode

721
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:54,576
of your uh yeah now i can see the yeah

722
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:58,581
Yeah, so the question nine, for example,

723
00:26:58,581 --> 00:26:59,862
so the way I did goes

724
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:01,925
on GitHub is maybe GitHub

725
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:04,888
related, but also GitLab, there is

726
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:05,489
a way to do it.

727
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:09,414
Please do zoom.

728
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:10,395
Okay, the zoom in, we have

729
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,997
to fix a little bit.

730
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,659
Sorry for that inconvenience.

731
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:16,883
If the text was too small, we will fix it.

732
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:18,985
I think, [name], you could

733
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,467
start with your part already.

734
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:21,288
And [name], I'm going to

735
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:23,030
stop sharing my screen now.

736
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:32,225
so can you see my screen or

737
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,488
like i see your share document

738
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:39,275
okay it's like uh let me top

739
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:49,389
the share and yeah give me a second

740
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:58,100
So until [name] set up that screen,

741
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,402
so the next lesson would be

742
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:03,665
about some more basics and we

743
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:07,469
will start with the browsing part

744
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,270
that also you could, you only

745
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,033
need the GitHub to do that.

746
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,697
Yes, I can still see

747
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,238
your shared document, [name].

748
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,399
Okay.

749
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,483
And actually I can't see the zoom controls.

750
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:23,763
Yes.

751
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:26,924
Okay.

752
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:28,205
We are currently showing

753
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,386
the shared document.

754
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:30,587
Okay.

755
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:32,809
Nobody's currently sharing the screen.

756
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:33,509
Yeah.

757
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,813
Okay.

758
00:28:38,694 --> 00:28:39,094
Okay.

759
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,135
Now I find it.

760
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:40,695
Let me share that.

761
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:42,017
All right.

762
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,361
So can you see it?

763
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:50,224
I'm switching over to your screen share.

764
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:50,524
Okay.

765
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,488
That's good.

766
00:28:57,662 --> 00:28:58,283
Is it better?

767
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:03,150
Just a moment.

768
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:07,355
Let's try again.

769
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:10,019
And yes, now it looks good.

770
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:19,933
Let me zoom in a bit.

771
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:20,394
Okay.

772
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:21,515
Yep.

773
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:22,877
Yes.

774
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:27,638
so yeah we can currently i

775
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:31,063
am in this uh the main page of the workshop

776
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,845
so now uh i will talk

777
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:35,328
about the browsing which you can

778
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,651
access in the day one okay

779
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,173
so basically what we are going

780
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:41,195
to do today is like uh we

781
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:44,119
are going to look at an existing repository

782
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,505
basically, and then we try

783
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:49,853
to understand how the repository is built.

784
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:50,936
And then later we try

785
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,081
to fork the repository, which means

786
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,284
that we are taking a copy

787
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:56,269
of the repository and then try

788
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:58,494
to modify and do some changes.

789
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,960
So that's what we are going to do now.

790
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,331
So basically, it's like different

791
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:07,894
ways of doing it.

792
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:11,562
Today, we will mostly focus on the GitHub,

793
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:12,965
but you can also use your

794
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:15,149
favorite like a VS Code or

795
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:17,835
command line and then try to do it.

796
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,598
So in the day one, we

797
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,380
will mostly focus on GitHub.

798
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,904
In the coming days, we will

799
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,587
talk about the rest of the things.

800
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:29,633
So what I'm going to do

801
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:32,758
is I'm going to take this repository,

802
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:34,841
which was created for this workshop,

803
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,465
which is CR workshop exercises,

804
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:39,388
and you can actually access

805
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,014
this using the links here.

806
00:30:43,014 --> 00:30:45,898
So the first link is for

807
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:48,120
participants and the second link is

808
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,803
for uh the people for the instructors

809
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:53,165
which is [name] and me so basically

810
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,487
what you're going to do now

811
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,349
is like uh you try to open

812
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:58,311
this link in a new tab and

813
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:01,093
then we will go through it okay so

814
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,775
so the thing with these two

815
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:04,096
links him on is the difference

816
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,518
is that the one would people

817
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:06,599
see it in the camera on

818
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,261
the during the recording so we

819
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:09,922
have created two links so the

820
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:12,465
we we can avoid showing

821
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:14,687
other people's usernames so

822
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:16,108
when you use it use the

823
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,850
recipe book not the recipe

824
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,594
book dash record recorded so only

825
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:26,099
use this one okay the one the first one

826
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:27,320
so now i'm going to open

827
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,684
the link so i'm opening the link

828
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:42,315
in a new tab so i will slightly zoom in so yeah

829
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,864
So basically, it's like this

830
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:46,146
is the repository.

831
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:51,395
And is the font enough, [name]?

832
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:53,137
Yeah, I think it's good enough, yes.

833
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,259
OK, OK, yeah.

834
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,266
So yeah, basically, this is the repository,

835
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:00,289
which is you can see the

836
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,751
name of the repository, which

837
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:04,215
is recipe book recorded.

838
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,840
and then it is under

839
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,109
this organization cr-workshop-exercises, okay?

840
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,571
So basically what we are going

841
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:14,115
to do today is we are

842
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,940
going to first navigate what is there,

843
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,684
what is here, and then we

844
00:32:18,684 --> 00:32:21,429
are going to basically take a

845
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:24,255
copy of this repository and

846
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:26,018
do some changes, okay?

847
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,362
So in order to do

848
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,289
the fork, basically, there should

849
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:31,252
be a fork icon.

850
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:31,693
Yes.

851
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:34,681
If you slightly zoom in, you

852
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:35,964
can see the fork icon here.

853
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:39,313
So what is a fork?

854
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:41,425
Why do we need that, [name]?

855
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:43,187
Okay, basically, it's like,

856
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:45,831
so this repository belongs to someone else.

857
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,713
And basically, if you want

858
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:50,257
to do some changes, okay, it's

859
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:52,359
better to make a copy of

860
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:55,524
the documents, like all the files,

861
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,306
and then you can modify the

862
00:32:57,306 --> 00:32:59,329
changes in your local repository

863
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:00,270
in your local files.

864
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,071
Okay.

865
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:04,155
And basically, that's what we do.

866
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,877
in while doing the forking

867
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:09,402
okay copy uh copy for yourself

868
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:11,965
in the cloud itself so maybe

869
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:12,826
you don't have access to

870
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,048
modify these files because this

871
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:16,191
is somebody else's repository but

872
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:17,012
if you are allowed to copy

873
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,874
it you can make a copy and

874
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,396
do things by yourself today

875
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:21,598
today that's what you want to

876
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:23,781
sort of practice on your own yeah

877
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:25,623
so now if you click on this fork

878
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:29,847
then it will open this create

879
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:31,989
a new fork window.

880
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:34,393
Basically here, it's like we

881
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:35,915
write some name.

882
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:39,179
So it is automatically predefined,

883
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,261
which is recipe book, recipe

884
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:43,144
dash book dash recorded.

885
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:45,006
Here you can write some optional.

886
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:49,612
Okay, we will use it for teaching.

887
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,102
Okay, basically so.

888
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:54,247
And then when you click on

889
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:57,471
this, I will uncheck this box,

890
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,535
copy the main branch only, and

891
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,017
then try to create the fork.

892
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:02,559
So if you press the screen.

893
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,100
What does that mean?

894
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,262
What happens if you clicked it?

895
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:08,508
Basically, it will copy all

896
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:10,331
the files, including other

897
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:12,213
people's branches also.

898
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:13,575
Right now, we just want to

899
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:14,957
copy only the main branch.

900
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,045
But then we should uncheck it, isn't it?

901
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,747
yeah sorry yeah we should

902
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:24,750
check this yeah but i think it's it's good

903
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,992
that we copy everybody else's

904
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:28,256
branches then they can see that branch

905
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:30,299
and everything yeah because i

906
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,082
also did some changes so in

907
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,806
case if yeah go ahead but

908
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,230
but let's see okay either way is

909
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,759
fine so it will take a time like i'm

910
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:47,624
So yeah, basically, yes.

911
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:49,890
Now I forked this branch.

912
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,780
So what you can see is like, so this,

913
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:57,188
I forked from this CR

914
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:59,935
workshop exercises, the one highlighted here.

915
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:02,239
This is what we call upstream.

916
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,501
This is where we actually

917
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,345
forked the repository.

918
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:14,499
Now, if you see the link

919
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:17,984
above, it should be your user account.

920
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:19,807
Basically, it's your username

921
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:22,051
for the GitHub.

922
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,914
That is what you should

923
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,799
be following for the next of the

924
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:30,445
for the today's lectures okay

925
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:34,632
and so now we will go

926
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,717
back to the main window and

927
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:39,620
then we will mostly like do

928
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,428
some exercises okay so uh now

929
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:46,331
uh [name] is this the time for

930
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:48,495
like uh should we take a break

931
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:50,458
now or should we do the exercises

932
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,520
So what we do is, Sehman,

933
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,602
now we break for 10 minutes.

934
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:55,503
Okay.

935
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,684
And then when we come back,

936
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:59,487
we can discuss the exercise.

937
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:01,188
Because when we say break,

938
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:02,450
we expect people to walk around

939
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,731
a little bit and have a break,

940
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,192
not look at the exercise.

941
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:06,133
Okay.

942
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,855
So [name] and [name], we're going

943
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:09,316
to have a break now.

944
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:10,217
If you could share the

945
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:12,700
shared document with 10 minutes break.

946
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,382
And we'll come back in

947
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,124
another 10 minutes according to the time zone.

948
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:24,063
Are you ready, [name]?

949
00:36:24,063 --> 00:36:24,706
Sorry, [name]?

950
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:26,412
Let's go on a break.

951
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:27,878
All right.

952
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:28,000
Bye.

953
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,714
Hi, welcome back from the break.

954
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:35,318
I hope you had you

955
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,500
just stretched your legs.

956
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:38,985
And so you can hear me

957
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:40,527
right like all of you.

958
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:41,930
Yeah, OK, great.

959
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,572
So what we're going to do

960
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:45,896
now is like this exercise.

961
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:48,801
So basically it's like you just

962
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,585
took a copy like a fork

963
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,448
of the repository which was shown above.

964
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,492
OK, so using this link.

965
00:36:55,492 --> 00:36:57,775
Now, what you're going to do

966
00:36:57,775 --> 00:37:01,599
is go to that link and do these exercises.

967
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,945
There are eight exercise questions.

968
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,629
First, you try to look

969
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,311
into each question and there

970
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:14,493
are some hints here and how to do that.

971
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:17,156
For suppose in the first one,

972
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:19,699
you try to look at the commit history.

973
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,183
To look at the commit history,

974
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:25,707
Basically, what you're going to

975
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:28,891
do is here is a small icon,

976
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:31,254
which is like, can you see the icon?

977
00:37:32,396 --> 00:37:32,877
Maybe a little.

978
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,118
The circle.

979
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,121
It may be.

980
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,685
The circle, if you go to this repository,

981
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:40,467
which you just forked, you

982
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,491
should see here your username and

983
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:46,556
then on the URL.

984
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,378
Here, when you zoom in, you

985
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:51,803
can see a small circle, like a timestamp.

986
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,528
When you click on it,

987
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:57,820
basically what you can see is

988
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,610
some commits made earlier.

989
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,673
Basically, you have to go

990
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:04,739
through this commit history and

991
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,805
try to see what has been done.

992
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:09,488
and then later like uh you

993
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,511
will also try to find another

994
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:13,273
way of looking at it like which

995
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:16,357
is uh you can use this insights

996
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:18,500
on the on this main page okay

997
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,883
and then try to see what

998
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,825
is happening in this ins when

999
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:24,607
you click on insights and when

1000
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:25,809
you click on the network

1001
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,511
within that insights okay

1002
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:30,176
so then also try to find

1003
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:34,164
out when the recipe was last modified

1004
00:38:34,164 --> 00:38:35,687
so what you're going to see

1005
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,012
is like this is a like

1006
00:38:38,012 --> 00:38:40,637
basically a recipe book for food

1007
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:42,941
like cooking so you are going

1008
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:45,787
to find like some food recipes okay it's like

1009
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:49,995
and you try to find take one recipe

1010
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,578
for suppose a salad or something

1011
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,261
and then see like when

1012
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,766
the this repository was modified

1013
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,850
or when the file was the

1014
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,856
recipe not not like python or c code

1015
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:03,600
Basically, it's like when you

1016
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,422
look at this Git page.

1017
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:08,185
Here you can see there

1018
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:12,831
are some desserts, pasta, salad, side soups.

1019
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:16,616
Let's first suppose we look at salads.

1020
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:21,042
Here there are different salads

1021
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:23,485
in this file.

1022
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:26,529
So first, suppose this is a Andhra salad.

1023
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:31,036
And basically, this is from my home place.

1024
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,781
And you can find what this recipe is about.

1025
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:35,842
If you want to cook something,

1026
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:38,266
then you can actually look into this recipe.

1027
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:40,429
So basically, it's like each

1028
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:45,676
one has different recipes in this codebook.

1029
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,558
One reason that it is a

1030
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,280
codebook, like not a programming

1031
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,942
language is that we want to

1032
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:53,184
be just focusing on the Git

1033
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,566
concept itself and the GitHub

1034
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:56,787
and the interface.

1035
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:58,929
So even people don't know, understand,

1036
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,071
if you're not working with

1037
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:01,712
Python, you still understand the concept.

1038
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:04,175
So that's why it's abstracted

1039
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:06,757
into a cooking recipe instead of like code.

1040
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:07,638
But in real life, you

1041
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,601
will be interacting with code when you do this.

1042
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:12,443
Nice.

1043
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,943
So yeah, let's go back to the exercise.

1044
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:18,765
So then you will also

1045
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:21,370
find this guacamole recipe, okay,

1046
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,792
which is under the sides.

1047
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:23,914
So basically, you try to

1048
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:26,057
like look into these exercises and

1049
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,820
try to do these exercises

1050
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,825
following on the repository, which

1051
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:32,247
you just made a copy of

1052
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:34,191
it, or which is forking it.

1053
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:34,671
Okay.

1054
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:36,194
Yeah, that's very important.

1055
00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:37,516
You know, look at your copy.

1056
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,719
yeah one one one one that

1057
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,782
says you know without the recorded

1058
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:44,866
uh prefix uh yeah it should be

1059
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,049
like uh here is your it

1060
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,551
should be your username the

1061
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:50,194
one highlighted your repository will

1062
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,537
be like this one https

1063
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:55,341
colon slash slash github.com

1064
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,045
slash your username slash recipe

1065
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:01,049
dash book and yeah please go

1066
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:02,651
uh take a look into this one

1067
00:41:02,651 --> 00:41:04,634
and try to do the exercises

1068
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:05,075
Yes.

1069
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:06,198
So now what we're going to

1070
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:07,922
do is we're going to break now.

1071
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:10,648
I mean, break means that we will not talk.

1072
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,572
And we'll give you 25 minutes.

1073
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:13,976
And [name] will share the

1074
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:14,998
shared document now.

1075
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:17,925
And we give you 25 minutes.

1076
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:19,400
Is that enough for him on?

1077
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,283
Yeah, I think 25 minutes is good.

1078
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:22,386
And I think they also

1079
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:25,091
have local instructors, like basically

1080
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,455
at each hosting site.

1081
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:28,417
Now we expect you to

1082
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,643
go through this exercise and do that.

1083
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:32,284
And if you have any

1084
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,067
questions, use the shared document

1085
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,612
to inform us, you know, any issues

1086
00:41:36,612 --> 00:41:37,373
that you have or any

1087
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:38,796
discussions that you want to participate in.

1088
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,120
And also maybe we can place

1089
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,244
a poll in the...

1090
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:44,365
share document to see if

1091
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:46,488
you are finished give us some notice

1092
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:47,990
that so we don't have to wait

1093
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,592
if you're already finished and

1094
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:53,657
i would recommend him on that

1095
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:55,359
maybe up to six is enough so

1096
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,044
six is the number six okay

1097
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,426
yeah sixth question up to go

1098
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:01,387
out to six question and the

1099
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:02,829
seven and eight is bonus for

1100
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:05,091
you yeah and we'll see within

1101
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:09,097
the first 25 minutes try to go up to six okay

1102
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:10,741
Okay, Anu, now we're going

1103
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,285
to share the shared document

1104
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:14,972
and indicate that 25 minutes of exercise time.

1105
00:42:14,972 --> 00:42:15,894
And then we come back

1106
00:42:15,894 --> 00:42:18,661
and Haman will explain the answers.

1107
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,525
Is that a good plan, Haman?

1108
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:22,009
Yeah, it sounds good.

1109
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:29,522
hi welcome back so i hope

1110
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:32,829
you guys were doing the exercises i see

1111
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:34,913
that about 20 people finished

1112
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:37,598
the exercise so now i will

1113
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:38,841
just quickly go through the

1114
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:42,388
solutions okay so let's look at the first uh

1115
00:42:42,388 --> 00:42:45,073
exercise which is like browsing

1116
00:42:45,073 --> 00:42:45,955
the commit history.

1117
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:49,402
Now I will switch the tab.

1118
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,287
Basically, if I go to the

1119
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,033
code to the main page, so for

1120
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,075
you it is the user.

1121
00:42:57,197 --> 00:43:04,531
If you click on this time circle here,

1122
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:07,534
It will then go to this

1123
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:10,279
page where you can see like

1124
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:11,861
the commits, all the commits

1125
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:14,786
which were made from all the people.

1126
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:17,330
So this one is the commits

1127
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,315
which I made yesterday and

1128
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:22,840
[name] made few commits also.

1129
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,122
And then we have also some

1130
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:26,145
commits from the last year.

1131
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,008
and what you can see here

1132
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,532
is like each commit has a

1133
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:34,077
some specific like a is a name like

1134
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:36,261
for suppose restoring the tests

1135
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:39,265
and when it is committed and

1136
00:43:39,265 --> 00:43:40,728
there is a unique id like

1137
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:42,250
as a subrim mentioned in the

1138
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,393
motivation for each commit you

1139
00:43:44,393 --> 00:43:45,675
make you will have a one

1140
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:48,099
id associated to it okay

1141
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:49,942
so that you can easily revert back

1142
00:43:49,942 --> 00:43:50,943
or you can look into uh

1143
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,909
what has been in the commit okay so

1144
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:57,192
if you click on that uh

1145
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:59,716
hash code you can see this one okay

1146
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:01,038
so these are the green ones

1147
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,960
are the changes which are made

1148
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,803
and the minus ones are some

1149
00:44:04,803 --> 00:44:06,986
like the previous ones so that

1150
00:44:06,986 --> 00:44:18,022
is about uh basically so the green one

1151
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:21,229
Now let's go to the next

1152
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:27,539
question, which is about the network graph.

1153
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,003
I will again go back to the main code page.

1154
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:34,791
This is the main page which you forked.

1155
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:36,834
So far we looked at the

1156
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,078
commits which were changed linearly.

1157
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:43,306
Now, if you basically click

1158
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,411
these three dots, like basically

1159
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:46,733
for me, since I am zooming

1160
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:50,340
in, so it is here for me in this insights.

1161
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,663
If you click on this insights,

1162
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:55,010
you will you can then see all these things.

1163
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:55,871
So now I'm going to

1164
00:44:55,871 --> 00:44:57,675
click this network here.

1165
00:44:57,675 --> 00:45:00,459
When you click on the network,

1166
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,241
what you can see is here

1167
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,745
is the history of the commits.

1168
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:10,111
I will just drag it.

1169
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:11,372
Here is these are the

1170
00:45:11,372 --> 00:45:13,575
commits which we made, [name] and me.

1171
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:17,100
The main black line is

1172
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,784
the main repository when we took the branch.

1173
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,667
You can see the timestamp

1174
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:26,852
and other things, what each commit we did.

1175
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:29,775
With this, you get a big overview of

1176
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:32,277
what has been done, like

1177
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:37,222
when you forked the branch and

1178
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:40,506
then when you started committing it back.

1179
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:47,212
These are the big overlook of the commits.

1180
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:48,854
Each dot is a commit.

1181
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,477
For suppose here, you are

1182
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:53,939
just forking that part.

1183
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:57,857
Next, let's look at the next question.

1184
00:45:58,758 --> 00:46:00,900
How can you find out when

1185
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,442
a recipe was last modified?

1186
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,785
So let's go back to the repository.

1187
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,329
And let's go to the main page.

1188
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,033
So let's say let's pick up some recipe,

1189
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:15,435
say for suppose salads and

1190
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:17,517
let's make a mixed salad.

1191
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,280
So here basically it's like

1192
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,963
here is the recipe and you

1193
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:25,225
can look at the history.

1194
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,427
Oh, maybe, yeah, you can

1195
00:46:31,427 --> 00:46:38,756
look, you can click on the code.

1196
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:41,139
So the question was, um, how can,

1197
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:43,942
if I read last modified, so I see that,

1198
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:46,505
uh, on the top, um, like

1199
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:47,487
near the clock, it says it

1200
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:49,252
was modified last year.

1201
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:50,073
Yeah.

1202
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:50,574
Okay.

1203
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,317
So, and then, okay, that is the question.

1204
00:46:53,317 --> 00:46:54,919
So now it's like to see

1205
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:56,721
when is it last modified.

1206
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:58,443
Here again, when you open the file,

1207
00:46:58,443 --> 00:46:59,604
you can see this again,

1208
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:02,147
this circle, the time circle.

1209
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:05,871
And if you click on this circle,

1210
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:07,233
which shows you all the

1211
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:09,295
history of the commits of this file.

1212
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:09,936
Okay.

1213
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:10,837
So these are the commits,

1214
00:47:10,837 --> 00:47:12,619
which you can see, like it

1215
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,822
was created in March 5th, and

1216
00:47:14,822 --> 00:47:17,585
there are some fixes to this file.

1217
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,188
okay so that is this uh

1218
00:47:20,188 --> 00:47:23,172
the third question and now let's go back

1219
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,393
and see what is the next question

1220
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:26,175
so the next question is

1221
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:27,517
how many changes did the

1222
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:30,501
coca-cola recipe receive so you

1223
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:33,084
can find this coca-cola recipe under sites

1224
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,467
and then try to click on

1225
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:36,828
some of the comments to see

1226
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:38,390
what changed okay let's do that

1227
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,873
so now i'm going back i

1228
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:42,075
can read the question for him so

1229
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:43,677
you can stay in the github

1230
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:47,353
okay yeah that would be great

1231
00:47:47,353 --> 00:47:51,619
okay now i will go back yeah okay

1232
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,141
so let's uh look at the

1233
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:55,925
salads it's in the salads right go come on

1234
00:47:55,925 --> 00:47:57,207
how many changes the goku molly

1235
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,549
is i think the side i think

1236
00:47:58,549 --> 00:48:01,293
it's a side sites and actually

1237
00:48:01,293 --> 00:48:02,574
if you don't know where to find

1238
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:05,198
it there is a search button here

1239
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:06,159
and you can use the search

1240
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,425
button yeah with this zooming in

1241
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:15,773
i don't it's on the top the

1242
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,325
So here you can.

1243
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,555
I'm sorry here go to file.

1244
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:31,163
Here you can look for a guacamole.

1245
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:37,212
So let me, I think I did it fast.

1246
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:38,555
If you click, if you look

1247
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:40,639
here, you can find go to file.

1248
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:42,262
And basically what you can do is like,

1249
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:43,124
you can, if you know the

1250
00:48:43,124 --> 00:48:44,627
file name, you can type here

1251
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:47,693
and you can click find the file.

1252
00:48:47,693 --> 00:48:48,275
Okay.

1253
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:50,058
It only works for the file names.

1254
00:48:50,058 --> 00:48:50,499
Okay.

1255
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:53,884
so here is the guacamole recipe okay

1256
00:48:53,884 --> 00:48:56,568
and then now the question is like

1257
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:59,833
how many how many how many changes okay

1258
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:00,894
so now let's again look

1259
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:03,578
at the history using this time stamp circle

1260
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,182
and so how many are there actually

1261
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:09,928
so one two three four five

1262
00:49:09,928 --> 00:49:11,891
so there are five changes five

1263
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:15,376
commits okay yes so the number

1264
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,679
five is which recipe includes

1265
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,250
the ingredient salt salt

1266
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,393
salt okay so now i will

1267
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:26,459
again go back to the main one code now

1268
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:28,121
since we already looked in

1269
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:30,445
terms of searching for the file okay

1270
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:33,089
but we can't know we don't know

1271
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:35,913
whether the salt is in within

1272
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:37,555
the file okay so what we are

1273
00:49:37,555 --> 00:49:38,536
going to do is like we

1274
00:49:38,536 --> 00:49:40,319
are using this search button which

1275
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,844
you can see on the top right

1276
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,063
top right and you can search

1277
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:51,087
here salt okay so if you are using yeah

1278
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:53,470
and then press enter then it

1279
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:58,235
will oh okay but the first

1280
00:49:58,235 --> 00:49:59,637
time when you search for the

1281
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:02,660
files i mean content of a

1282
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,302
file it's indexed a little bit

1283
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,404
so you could also search on

1284
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:08,747
the original repo if you want yes

1285
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:11,350
yeah i will do that too

1286
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:19,255
Let me go there.

1287
00:50:22,305 --> 00:50:24,351
So this is the original repo.

1288
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:24,793
Yeah.

1289
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:27,642
This is the original repo.

1290
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:28,404
Okay.

1291
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:29,909
So basically now what I'm going

1292
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:31,313
to do is like I'm searching here.

1293
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:36,367
So now you can see wherever

1294
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,191
the salt is mentioned, you can

1295
00:50:38,993 --> 00:50:41,499
see all the files.

1296
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:42,602
So for suppose it is in

1297
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:47,334
the salts backslash mixit.md, and

1298
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:51,223
then it is also in the deserts.

1299
00:50:51,223 --> 00:50:54,068
And then it is also in the guacamole

1300
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,650
and in this Andhra salad

1301
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,835
and the mushroom soup, pumpkin

1302
00:50:58,835 --> 00:51:00,979
pipe, and then Andhra mango

1303
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:03,984
pickle and vegetarian lasagna.

1304
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:04,344
Okay.

1305
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:05,286
So basically it's like if

1306
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:06,668
you want to search for this

1307
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:09,773
salt, you use this search button,

1308
00:51:09,773 --> 00:51:10,915
which was on the top.

1309
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:11,155
Okay.

1310
00:51:12,317 --> 00:51:13,438
Okay.

1311
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:14,900
Now I will go back to the,

1312
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,764
I can read the, I can read the question.

1313
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,626
The sixth one is that

1314
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:21,228
in the Gokumala recipe, find

1315
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:24,372
out who modified each line last and when.

1316
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:24,472
Okay.

1317
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:27,596
So let's go to the

1318
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:29,598
Gokumala recipe, which is in the sites.

1319
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:35,766
So the question is who modified last?

1320
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:36,046
Yes.

1321
00:51:37,005 --> 00:51:39,910
So it's actually the blame they're asking.

1322
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,433
Yeah, OK, yeah.

1323
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:45,540
So to see, you can click on the file, OK?

1324
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:47,623
And when you click on the

1325
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:51,610
file, you should see, where is this blame?

1326
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:55,016
Yeah, OK.

1327
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:57,140
I need to zoom a bit.

1328
00:52:05,574 --> 00:52:06,915
Yeah, so another way to do

1329
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,797
that is, [name], is that if you

1330
00:52:08,797 --> 00:52:10,218
go back to the file.

1331
00:52:10,218 --> 00:52:10,398
Yeah.

1332
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:15,243
So that is what the

1333
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:19,547
answer for the recommended answer

1334
00:52:19,547 --> 00:52:20,788
is that you go back to the

1335
00:52:20,788 --> 00:52:22,029
file and click on blame, yes.

1336
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:22,449
Yes, yes.

1337
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,933
So yeah, I went back to the file.

1338
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:28,175
OK, and let me do it again.

1339
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:31,818
So here is the file.

1340
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:32,979
You click on this file.

1341
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:35,783
Then you can see here, right

1342
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:37,725
now you are in the preview mode,

1343
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:39,127
so you need to now go to the blame.

1344
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:41,750
When you click on the blame,

1345
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,694
you can see when the file was modified

1346
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:48,299
and you can see who added

1347
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,021
this line or who changed this

1348
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:53,506
line by clicking on this blame.

1349
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:57,451
This is the three rectangles.

1350
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:00,733
So when you click on it,

1351
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:05,919
you can see who has changed this.

1352
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,864
So the question number seven

1353
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:10,306
is more about, you know, are

1354
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:11,488
we allowed to use it?

1355
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,672
It's talking about some license.

1356
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:15,014
Okay.

1357
00:53:15,014 --> 00:53:17,699
So it would be in the report.

1358
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,762
Do you have anything to

1359
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:21,345
mention about license?

1360
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:23,708
So here, yeah, it's like

1361
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,932
they basically when I clone the

1362
00:53:25,932 --> 00:53:28,036
repo, there is a license

1363
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:29,839
associated to it, which is

1364
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,463
like a creative common license 1.0.

1365
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:35,507
so it's like either you can

1366
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:40,153
see on the main page like with this license

1367
00:53:40,153 --> 00:53:44,218
or else what is more nice is like

1368
00:53:44,218 --> 00:53:44,959
when you click on this

1369
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:47,382
license basically you can look

1370
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:50,265
see all this what are the permissions

1371
00:53:50,265 --> 00:53:51,387
and how can you use

1372
00:53:51,387 --> 00:53:53,489
this permissions okay so that's

1373
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:55,512
very later on in this course

1374
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:58,416
so yeah no more but this

1375
00:53:58,416 --> 00:53:59,637
this basically tells you what

1376
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:00,358
you are allowed to do and

1377
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:02,552
what you are not allowed yeah

1378
00:54:02,552 --> 00:54:03,874
So what kind of license

1379
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,055
do you use normally?

1380
00:54:06,137 --> 00:54:08,540
It's like a Creative Commons.

1381
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,823
Creative Commons or MIT for code.

1382
00:54:10,823 --> 00:54:14,047
So GNU public license.

1383
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:16,350
Mostly open source copyright.

1384
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,053
Yeah, because now if the

1385
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:21,697
funding agencies are now pushing

1386
00:54:21,697 --> 00:54:25,562
towards the fair, like sharing the code fair.

1387
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,986
So it's important to have a license.

1388
00:54:28,986 --> 00:54:30,248
Yeah, it's really important.

1389
00:54:30,248 --> 00:54:30,817
Yeah.

1390
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:32,299
Okay, so the last question,

1391
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:34,963
Iman, is that it's in the main repository.

1392
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:37,266
Is there any pull requests?

1393
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,870
Okay, yeah.

1394
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,673
Later on, but the pull

1395
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:44,916
request in general is that what I did was,

1396
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:45,817
Iman, is that I did some

1397
00:54:45,817 --> 00:54:47,900
modification and I send it upstream.

1398
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,902
Upstream is the place where I copied.

1399
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:52,326
Downstream is my local copy.

1400
00:54:52,326 --> 00:54:53,547
And I made some changes.

1401
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:55,250
I asked from the authors, would

1402
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,912
you like to incorporate it?

1403
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:57,632
Okay.

1404
00:54:57,632 --> 00:55:02,417
Basically, I'm now at the upstream,

1405
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:03,939
which is where I started

1406
00:55:03,939 --> 00:55:06,582
forking my repository, which is

1407
00:55:06,582 --> 00:55:08,865
like a CR workshop exercises.

1408
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:12,089
Then this is the main page

1409
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:13,690
and you can see these icons,

1410
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,352
issues and pull requests.

1411
00:55:15,352 --> 00:55:18,156
Now the question is about the pull request.

1412
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,438
When you click this pull request,

1413
00:55:20,438 --> 00:55:22,160
what you can see is like,

1414
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,822
are there any open issues?

1415
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:28,169
[name], you will be talking

1416
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:29,250
about it later, right?

1417
00:55:30,252 --> 00:55:32,716
Yeah, we can just talk about it now.

1418
00:55:32,716 --> 00:55:34,218
If you click on that salad

1419
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:37,102
recipe, so that is a new change I propose.

1420
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:40,067
Would you like to incorporate it?

1421
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:40,267
Yeah.

1422
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:42,831
If you see that the commits are there,

1423
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:44,113
what changed, you could also

1424
00:55:44,113 --> 00:55:46,637
click and see what file was changed.

1425
00:55:46,637 --> 00:55:47,819
and what the commits were.

1426
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,186
And then as the owner of the repo

1427
00:55:53,186 --> 00:55:54,608
or some of the review, we

1428
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:56,010
call it the review process, which means

1429
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:56,852
that you go through the

1430
00:55:56,852 --> 00:55:57,873
code and see whether it's

1431
00:55:57,873 --> 00:55:59,936
appropriate to be incorporated into

1432
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:01,198
the main line of development.

1433
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,081
And then you could do

1434
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:04,763
something called merge to...

1435
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:08,571
make it um combined to the

1436
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:10,874
main branch yeah yeah i would

1437
00:56:10,874 --> 00:56:11,976
also like to mention a little

1438
00:56:11,976 --> 00:56:14,660
bit about the the pull request

1439
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,022
before i send the request i

1440
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:17,464
opened an issue him on so if

1441
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:19,887
you click on the issue so there

1442
00:56:19,887 --> 00:56:21,089
is a yeah this is what

1443
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,052
right one working awaiting approval

1444
00:56:23,052 --> 00:56:24,113
this is what you are waiting

1445
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:27,238
for yes but uh yeah so where

1446
00:56:27,238 --> 00:56:31,473
should i go uh issues issues okay yeah

1447
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:33,135
So before I send the request,

1448
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:33,875
I made an issue.

1449
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,038
Just like anyone has a good salad.

1450
00:56:37,038 --> 00:56:39,441
So somebody asking, you know, salad.

1451
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:41,062
And then before I send the change

1452
00:56:41,062 --> 00:56:43,264
or start working on it, I

1453
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:44,265
opened an issue and said, you

1454
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:47,088
know, I'm going to send a salad recipe.

1455
00:56:47,088 --> 00:56:48,389
So everybody else would know

1456
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:49,791
that somebody is working on something.

1457
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:51,572
So we don't have to, you

1458
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:53,234
know, do the same thing.

1459
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:54,956
So after that, in the

1460
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:57,438
next episode, we'll talk about,

1461
00:56:57,438 --> 00:56:58,279
you know, in the issue, it

1462
00:56:58,279 --> 00:56:59,520
could be, we could record.

1463
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,265
what happened and it also

1464
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:03,948
tells the public that somebody is

1465
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:05,951
working on it so others could help

1466
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:06,793
or not to do the same

1467
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:09,197
thing in parallel and also

1468
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:11,020
what has somebody done up to

1469
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,727
now okay and what is this sub issue

1470
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:18,306
That is to create another issue.

1471
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:20,209
So if you could create another issue,

1472
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:21,611
but that's, we're not going

1473
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:23,334
to talk today, but you could

1474
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:25,397
create like a related issue.

1475
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:26,959
Let's say something related to

1476
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:28,702
this salad recipe, but somebody

1477
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:30,465
wants to work on, I don't

1478
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:32,688
know, maybe a topping, for example.

1479
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:33,449
Okay.

1480
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:33,830
So, yeah.

1481
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:38,378
Yes, so those are the questions, [name].

1482
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:39,499
Then now what I will do is

1483
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:41,982
I will share the shared document

1484
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:42,683
to see whether there are

1485
00:57:42,683 --> 00:57:43,584
any interesting questions.

1486
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:44,044
Is that okay?

1487
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,886
Okay, yeah.

1488
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:47,387
But for everyone, you can

1489
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:51,552
also get the solutions in the main page.

1490
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,333
So if you browse down, you

1491
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:55,355
also can see the solutions.

1492
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:56,176
Yes.

1493
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:57,458
Over to [name].

1494
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:58,619
Yeah, so now I'm going to

1495
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,561
share the shared document from

1496
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:01,842
my screen share now.

1497
00:58:04,303 --> 00:58:06,826
Is this my screen, Janu?

1498
00:58:11,772 --> 00:58:15,056
It's collaborative notes, I see.

1499
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:16,078
So currently we are showing

1500
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:20,082
the notes, and Herman's screen

1501
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:21,905
is still being shared.

1502
00:58:21,905 --> 00:58:22,986
Can you stop?

1503
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:24,448
Yeah, I will stop the share.

1504
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:31,036
Once again.

1505
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,312
So in this one question is

1506
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:39,974
that there was some configuration,

1507
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,216
for example, how to do

1508
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:43,901
this on Visual Studio Code and...

1509
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:45,403
I stopped the share.

1510
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:45,703
Yeah.

1511
00:58:45,703 --> 00:58:48,508
So those questions, those are

1512
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:50,491
needed for the rest of the day.

1513
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:51,753
And at the end of the day,

1514
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:53,396
I will show some Git

1515
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,419
configurations, some things you

1516
00:58:55,419 --> 00:59:00,210
needed for later on that you could go and...

1517
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,092
make sure those are working

1518
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:04,895
before the rest of the course.

1519
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:06,076
And the other thing is, [name], is

1520
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,678
that some people have

1521
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,720
mentioned about GitHub, I mean,

1522
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,302
Google Drive, for example, Google

1523
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:12,703
Docs, you could have some versions.

1524
00:59:13,564 --> 00:59:15,666
And even in like a

1525
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,847
Microsoft ecosystem, you have

1526
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,309
the Microsoft Word and also

1527
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,351
the LibreOffice in the free

1528
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:23,194
version, open source versions that

1529
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:24,695
you have something called track changes.

1530
00:59:26,237 --> 00:59:27,839
So those also have some sort

1531
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,120
of a version controlling.

1532
00:59:29,943 --> 00:59:31,444
But for the code, it's

1533
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:34,367
not that convenient to combine things

1534
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,148
and do a lot of things,

1535
00:59:36,148 --> 00:59:38,891
but there is some version control.

1536
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:41,593
But if you try to version

1537
00:59:41,593 --> 00:59:43,155
control a Word document on

1538
00:59:43,155 --> 00:59:44,976
Git, I don't recommend it.

1539
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:46,778
It's not going to work well.

1540
00:59:46,778 --> 00:59:48,579
Okay.

1541
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:49,540
So then it's a plain

1542
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,262
text is the recommended one.

1543
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:52,843
Is there anything else, [name],

1544
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:55,786
you see that here that we should mention?

1545
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:58,168
Yeah, that's, I'm trying to see this.

1546
00:59:58,168 --> 00:59:58,884
What is

1547
00:59:58,884 --> 01:00:00,346
My search for salt result

1548
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,928
in this repository's code being

1549
01:00:02,928 --> 01:00:03,669
indexed right now.

1550
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:03,889
Yeah.

1551
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:06,452
So the indexing is that people

1552
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:09,816
who know about databases, they know

1553
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,117
that when you want to

1554
01:00:11,117 --> 01:00:12,598
search some things, you have

1555
01:00:12,598 --> 01:00:15,221
to get the keywords and create

1556
01:00:15,221 --> 01:00:16,382
some sort of index.

1557
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:18,044
So that takes a little bit of time.

1558
01:00:18,044 --> 01:00:19,806
It will take about two

1559
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:20,827
or three minutes maximum.

1560
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:24,431
And then you can search the GitHub.

1561
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:26,293
So that's a normal thing.

1562
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:26,829
Yeah.

1563
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:28,593
We are, I'm ready to go

1564
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,017
to your screen share separate.

1565
01:00:31,017 --> 01:00:32,500
Okay, go ahead.

1566
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,863
All right.

1567
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,867
Yeah, good.

1568
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:36,990
And anything else, Ayman, that

1569
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,515
you want to mention before we move on?

1570
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:40,396
No, nothing.

1571
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:41,940
It's mostly they were asking

1572
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,585
about the license, but yeah,

1573
01:00:44,585 --> 01:00:48,395
the helpers were answering them.

1574
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,116
Okay.

1575
01:00:49,116 --> 01:00:50,298
So the license is important

1576
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:51,400
to choose like even before

1577
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,243
you commit your first piece

1578
01:00:53,243 --> 01:00:54,886
of code, it's better that you

1579
01:00:54,886 --> 01:00:55,827
create a license and in

1580
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:59,413
the upcoming, between the same

1581
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:00,936
course upcoming lessons, we'll talk

1582
01:01:00,936 --> 01:01:03,781
a little bit about licensing.

1583
01:01:04,642 --> 01:01:06,124
So now what we do is,

1584
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:07,887
Iman, that I will introduce the

1585
01:01:07,887 --> 01:01:09,670
next lesson a little bit before

1586
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:13,657
we go to a break, which is the longer break.

1587
01:01:13,657 --> 01:01:16,020
okay um so we have done

1588
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,543
now the browsing part and

1589
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:19,466
then the committing part so

1590
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:21,408
what does committing means uh to

1591
01:01:21,408 --> 01:01:23,632
you um hey man and there

1592
01:01:23,632 --> 01:01:25,615
is this interchangeable word which

1593
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,517
is used uh commit and record

1594
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,160
a little bit in this lessons

1595
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,201
do you have any comment about

1596
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:34,147
this uh it's like uh basically

1597
01:01:35,882 --> 01:01:40,106
I create some changes and I want to like,

1598
01:01:40,106 --> 01:01:42,369
uh, basically right now we

1599
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,231
created some salads, right?

1600
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:45,912
Like a guacamole salad and

1601
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,654
trying to add new salads.

1602
01:01:47,654 --> 01:01:48,936
And now I want to push

1603
01:01:48,936 --> 01:01:50,597
this to the upstream.

1604
01:01:50,597 --> 01:01:52,319
So this is what, uh, I

1605
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,981
mean, uh, I think the commit means,

1606
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:56,744
or I want to record these changes.

1607
01:01:57,905 --> 01:01:58,445
Is that right?

1608
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:01,469
Um, that's kind of right.

1609
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:03,110
But the technical word for that

1610
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,532
is we call it push.

1611
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:05,244
Yeah.

1612
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:07,648
So the commit in Git and

1613
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:10,113
the recording is interchangeably used.

1614
01:02:10,113 --> 01:02:12,777
In the Git technology, if you

1615
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:14,020
sort of dig a little bit, I

1616
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:17,305
don't want to kind of go

1617
01:02:17,305 --> 01:02:18,427
deep into technical details, but

1618
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:22,254
when we look at the terminal,

1619
01:02:22,254 --> 01:02:23,256
you will see there's something

1620
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:26,221
called a .git folder, which tracks

1621
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:27,784
all of these snapshots.

1622
01:02:27,784 --> 01:02:28,645
There's a place where the

1623
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:30,152
snapshots are kept.

1624
01:02:30,152 --> 01:02:31,914
So it's a timestamp.

1625
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,936
Yeah, with the timestamp and

1626
01:02:32,936 --> 01:02:34,437
everything and also the metadata,

1627
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:35,359
it's kept somewhere.

1628
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,460
Even in the cloud, there

1629
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,843
is .git folder where it's like

1630
01:02:38,843 --> 01:02:40,225
a database of all these changes.

1631
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:44,670
So the changes I kept in a way as diffs.

1632
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,832
Diff is like a difference

1633
01:02:45,832 --> 01:02:48,595
between what was last and what was now.

1634
01:02:48,595 --> 01:02:51,379
So it doesn't keep copies of each snapshot,

1635
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:52,921
but instead it keeps the

1636
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:54,623
difference between the parent.

1637
01:02:55,869 --> 01:02:58,594
So in this sense, in

1638
01:02:58,594 --> 01:03:00,657
the browser, it's difficult to show this.

1639
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:05,025
So the Git works in a two-step process.

1640
01:03:05,025 --> 01:03:06,747
You have to add and

1641
01:03:06,747 --> 01:03:07,849
commit, which means that you

1642
01:03:07,849 --> 01:03:09,272
have to suggest that you're

1643
01:03:09,272 --> 01:03:11,310
going to add something and then

1644
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,673
permanent make it permanent so

1645
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:16,616
as soon as you suggest to git

1646
01:03:16,616 --> 01:03:18,439
that you know i want

1647
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:19,840
version control this it's actually

1648
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,944
get recorded but in a subsequent

1649
01:03:22,944 --> 01:03:25,086
step it also incorporates the

1650
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:28,711
metadata like timestamp and everything

1651
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:29,952
and then it creates a

1652
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:31,995
message log message and it make

1653
01:03:31,995 --> 01:03:36,892
it permanent so in this sense in this

1654
01:03:36,892 --> 01:03:38,253
lesson, what we're going to

1655
01:03:38,253 --> 01:03:40,376
talk about is how to make

1656
01:03:40,376 --> 01:03:42,958
a change permanently recorded in

1657
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,960
a snapshot on your local copy.

1658
01:03:45,981 --> 01:03:47,042
Then we come to what you

1659
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:49,545
said later on tomorrow, you

1660
01:03:49,545 --> 01:03:51,647
make permanent in your copy, and

1661
01:03:51,647 --> 01:03:53,829
then you send that change

1662
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,211
upstream, which is the place you

1663
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:57,293
copied it from to incorporate.

1664
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,314
We call that the push.

1665
01:03:58,314 --> 01:03:59,615
So those are the two

1666
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:01,477
concepts that we're going to talk about.

1667
01:04:01,477 --> 01:04:02,438
But now we're going to talk

1668
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:03,819
about only on the local copy

1669
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,980
and then how to make that

1670
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,904
Here we have a

1671
01:04:09,904 --> 01:04:12,927
different terminology background that

1672
01:04:12,927 --> 01:04:13,789
we are going to talk about.

1673
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,511
Repository is where all these

1674
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:17,133
files are all together.

1675
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:20,136
And commit is, we know

1676
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:21,959
that that's a snapshot, which is

1677
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,983
the status of that, the set

1678
01:04:24,983 --> 01:04:27,426
of files with some metadata.

1679
01:04:27,426 --> 01:04:28,727
And when you have a

1680
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:31,431
snapshot entire project in time,

1681
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:33,930
like that we also had a look.

1682
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,432
and a branch, we had

1683
01:04:35,432 --> 01:04:38,436
to try different things.

1684
01:04:38,436 --> 01:04:40,819
Then you could combine them later on.

1685
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,943
And then this one, I would

1686
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:45,425
like to hold on for a

1687
01:04:45,425 --> 01:04:48,669
moment about the reference to

1688
01:04:48,669 --> 01:04:50,471
like a sticky note, because

1689
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:52,453
we need some context to understand that.

1690
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:53,695
And then we have tags,

1691
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:55,517
which are like sticky notes that

1692
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,139
you stick to someplace, but it doesn't move.

1693
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:00,764
A commit is also like that, but it moves.

1694
01:05:02,263 --> 01:05:03,825
So in this sense, in

1695
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:06,448
order to understand all this, the best way,

1696
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,450
[name], is that I can show us

1697
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,892
how to do it a little bit.

1698
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:11,494
Okay.

1699
01:05:12,295 --> 01:05:14,397
We will not talk about the exercise now.

1700
01:05:14,397 --> 01:05:15,438
I mean, exercise we will

1701
01:05:15,438 --> 01:05:16,980
talk about after the lunch.

1702
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,263
But we will get some

1703
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:21,045
context within the next four

1704
01:05:21,045 --> 01:05:22,507
or five minutes that what we need.

1705
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:27,710
So if you remember that the...

1706
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:31,824
the browsing lesson you used a repository.

1707
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:33,029
Yes.

1708
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,598
Which is called the recorded version.

1709
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,304
So, in that recorded version I

1710
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:38,347
am going to right click and

1711
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:39,391
open it in another tab.

1712
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:45,351
And for the users, they go to their own.

1713
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:47,695
So right now it is only the demo, right?

1714
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:48,015
Yes.

1715
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:50,819
So I'm going to show some concepts here,

1716
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,862
but describing the text, but

1717
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:54,925
I'm going to show it on the GitHub itself.

1718
01:05:55,866 --> 01:05:56,567
Here, as you see that

1719
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:57,849
there are three defaults, but

1720
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:00,032
don't fork from this because if

1721
01:06:00,032 --> 01:06:01,434
you fork it, people will see

1722
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:03,657
your username in the video.

1723
01:06:03,657 --> 01:06:05,219
So please try to use

1724
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:07,742
the version without the recorder,

1725
01:06:07,742 --> 01:06:10,286
but the same, you could do the same things.

1726
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:11,608
So if you see the fork here,

1727
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:12,830
I see that I have a fork here.

1728
01:06:16,915 --> 01:06:18,678
So the idea is to add

1729
01:06:18,678 --> 01:06:20,941
something in this, some contribution

1730
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:22,243
that I have to make.

1731
01:06:22,243 --> 01:06:23,044
So in order to make

1732
01:06:23,044 --> 01:06:25,087
the contribution, the idea is

1733
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:27,630
that I will create a branch,

1734
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,025
as that sunglass branch and the hat branch.

1735
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:32,768
Then I could mention that my

1736
01:06:32,768 --> 01:06:35,653
name to be more explanatory,

1737
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,980
new recipe, because I'm not

1738
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:42,544
sure what I'm going to suggest yet.

1739
01:06:43,426 --> 01:06:45,509
Then when you type something, a

1740
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:47,012
name of a branch, if it

1741
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:48,915
is not already there, it will

1742
01:06:48,915 --> 01:06:50,317
suggest to create it.

1743
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:53,556
So if somebody asks you to

1744
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:54,877
create a branch and if you're

1745
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,941
working on the web browser itself, you see

1746
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:59,643
that this is a recipe branch

1747
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:00,624
and you also have the main

1748
01:07:00,624 --> 01:07:01,925
branch, but now you see the

1749
01:07:01,925 --> 01:07:03,027
branch that I created.

1750
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:08,794
So in that branch, what I could do is

1751
01:07:08,794 --> 01:07:10,756
if I want to contribute something,

1752
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:14,300
for example, I don't know,

1753
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,144
a soup, for example, I'll go

1754
01:07:17,144 --> 01:07:21,633
to that place and then I could

1755
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:24,078
you know, create a file.

1756
01:07:24,078 --> 01:07:26,603
So when, what we do after lunch is

1757
01:07:26,603 --> 01:07:30,130
that we will see how to,

1758
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,194
you know, I created a branch now,

1759
01:07:32,194 --> 01:07:34,238
so you could also, you know,

1760
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:35,380
try to create now, but you

1761
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,087
know, now we'll have a break very soon.

1762
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:41,611
After that, I will show how

1763
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:43,413
to make a contribution onto the

1764
01:07:43,413 --> 01:07:44,934
local copy of your copy.

1765
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:47,197
As you can see from the top here, [name],

1766
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:48,698
I'm working on my copy, the

1767
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:50,941
[name]-recipes, not on the main,

1768
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,022
the place I copied.

1769
01:07:53,023 --> 01:07:55,966
And then I will try to

1770
01:07:55,966 --> 01:07:58,248
make my changes there.

1771
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:02,713
Now what we'll do is that,

1772
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:04,735
now we'll break for the lunch now.

1773
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:07,820
And those things I mentioned,

1774
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,482
I will show them again.

1775
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:12,005
So we will come back to this.

1776
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,848
So the line is one hour.

1777
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:15,000
And then we will indicate that time,

1778
01:08:15,702 --> 01:08:17,304
Hello, welcome back.

1779
01:08:19,087 --> 01:08:20,388
Did you have a good lunch break, [name]?

1780
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,713
Yeah, yeah, I had a nice lunch.

1781
01:08:23,713 --> 01:08:24,253
How about you?

1782
01:08:25,295 --> 01:08:28,399
Yes, I had a smaller lunch.

1783
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,882
I don't want to fall asleep while teaching.

1784
01:08:30,882 --> 01:08:32,725
That wouldn't be nice, isn't it?

1785
01:08:32,725 --> 01:08:34,527
Yes, yes.

1786
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,151
So before we start, [name],

1787
01:08:37,151 --> 01:08:38,132
there's this question about

1788
01:08:38,132 --> 01:08:41,216
whether the learners need to

1789
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:42,438
keep the solutions.

1790
01:08:42,438 --> 01:08:44,601
So the solutions are needed if

1791
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:45,942
they want a certificate.

1792
01:08:45,942 --> 01:08:48,364
So the certificate must probably

1793
01:08:48,364 --> 01:08:49,566
be able to be converted

1794
01:08:49,566 --> 01:08:53,369
into one European credit.

1795
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,492
And the details are here in

1796
01:08:55,492 --> 01:08:59,335
this link for question 39.

1797
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,737
And you can go through them

1798
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:06,523
and then ask back if that's not clear enough.

1799
01:09:06,523 --> 01:09:06,883
Okay.

1800
01:09:08,004 --> 01:09:09,305
Is there anything, any other

1801
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:10,186
question that we need to

1802
01:09:10,186 --> 01:09:12,470
check before we proceed on?

1803
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:16,079
I think this is the key

1804
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,504
question apart from this because now

1805
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:21,251
since we are moving to exercise two,

1806
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:23,055
so the students have to

1807
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:25,020
submit the exercise to like in

1808
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,463
order to get the one ECTS.

1809
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:28,929
But apart from that, nothing

1810
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:30,613
else is seems important.

1811
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:34,837
Uh, so then we move to the next lesson,

1812
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,799
uh, the committing, if you remember

1813
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,182
before the lunch break, I went to the,

1814
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:40,843
I went to the committee lesson

1815
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,105
and I just show you a little

1816
01:09:42,105 --> 01:09:44,247
bit and I went and create a fork.

1817
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,149
So the fork would be ready,

1818
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:47,811
you know, just in case if it takes time.

1819
01:09:49,032 --> 01:09:52,575
Um, and then, um, in this

1820
01:09:52,575 --> 01:09:58,221
lesson, um, what we did was that, um, um,

1821
01:09:59,956 --> 01:10:02,824
to another local copy of the copy

1822
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:07,016
that we made from the forking exercise

1823
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:08,179
that we were trying to

1824
01:10:10,265 --> 01:10:14,114
contribute something from our side, right?

1825
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:17,980
And then what we did was that I clicked,

1826
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,662
I went to the recipe and make sure

1827
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:24,389
that it's your, the recipe of your,

1828
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:25,271
I mean, the copy of

1829
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:28,015
the repository, that's what we

1830
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,378
call the fork, that you are here.

1831
01:10:30,378 --> 01:10:31,660
And then I went, I clicked

1832
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,364
on this place where it says

1833
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:35,867
main, the branch, you know,

1834
01:10:35,867 --> 01:10:37,709
the branch symbol and the main.

1835
01:10:37,709 --> 01:10:40,173
And I went there and I typed

1836
01:10:40,173 --> 01:10:42,076
a name of a branch.

1837
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,864
so that branch was not there

1838
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,174
so gitlab said you know do

1839
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:48,846
you want to create that so i created that branch

1840
01:10:50,024 --> 01:10:52,848
Now I switch to that branch.

1841
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,611
So when you're creating a

1842
01:10:54,611 --> 01:11:00,339
branch, this will be more important during the,

1843
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,162
when we go on the terminal

1844
01:11:02,162 --> 01:11:04,886
on the Visual Studio or any other IDE as well.

1845
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,709
Just creating the branch is not enough.

1846
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:08,051
You have to switch to that.

1847
01:11:08,051 --> 01:11:09,513
Otherwise, you will be creating

1848
01:11:09,513 --> 01:11:10,515
a branch, but you will be

1849
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:11,857
working on the main branch.

1850
01:11:11,857 --> 01:11:14,100
So you have to do the switching first.

1851
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,622
So here you have switched.

1852
01:11:15,622 --> 01:11:16,720
What was that?

1853
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,701
How do you do that?

1854
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:19,043
How do you do the switching?

1855
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:20,725
Yeah, switching means I went

1856
01:11:20,725 --> 01:11:22,167
there and I selected that branch.

1857
01:11:23,168 --> 01:11:24,290
So now I'm here.

1858
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,212
If I select main, now I'm

1859
01:11:26,212 --> 01:11:26,893
in the main branch.

1860
01:11:28,154 --> 01:11:29,296
Although I had created a

1861
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:30,978
branch for myself, I'm still

1862
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:31,759
in the main branch.

1863
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:34,623
So I had to explicitly switch to that.

1864
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,746
So then I need to

1865
01:11:37,746 --> 01:11:42,252
contribute something to the recipe.

1866
01:11:42,252 --> 01:11:46,137
Let me see if there's anything already.

1867
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:51,309
available for me to paste in.

1868
01:11:51,309 --> 01:11:53,812
So then,

1869
01:11:53,812 --> 01:11:55,355
There's another thing that

1870
01:11:55,355 --> 01:11:56,797
important thing about this is

1871
01:11:56,797 --> 01:11:58,940
that there's a small check when

1872
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,064
you submit a recipe.

1873
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:04,289
So a check means that usually

1874
01:12:04,289 --> 01:12:05,711
if it's a code, you have

1875
01:12:05,711 --> 01:12:07,074
to make sure some basic tests

1876
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:08,436
are passed before you integrate

1877
01:12:08,436 --> 01:12:11,521
into the main line of development.

1878
01:12:11,521 --> 01:12:13,504
So excuse me a little bit.

1879
01:12:13,504 --> 01:12:15,567
I'm going to show something

1880
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:16,629
further down the page.

1881
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:17,811
So I'm going to scroll down.

1882
01:12:19,529 --> 01:12:20,690
and show you that there

1883
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:21,851
are basic things you need.

1884
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:23,333
So there should be a title

1885
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,635
for the name of the recipe,

1886
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:26,456
and then you should have

1887
01:12:26,456 --> 01:12:28,898
some ingredients and instructions.

1888
01:12:28,898 --> 01:12:30,199
So these things are needed.

1889
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,203
If this is missing, the test would fail.

1890
01:12:34,203 --> 01:12:34,824
It would say that you

1891
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:35,784
don't have instructions.

1892
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:36,445
So it has to be in

1893
01:12:36,445 --> 01:12:39,388
the same spellings, for example.

1894
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,609
So to make sure that

1895
01:12:40,609 --> 01:12:42,731
my first commit doesn't fail, I'm

1896
01:12:42,731 --> 01:12:44,433
going to copy this and I'm

1897
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:45,874
slowly going to move up again

1898
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:48,750
And then I'm going back to

1899
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,633
the other tab, which is the copy

1900
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:52,675
of the, or the fork.

1901
01:12:53,676 --> 01:13:00,064
And then I want to create

1902
01:13:02,306 --> 01:13:03,828
like a contribute something.

1903
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:05,630
So here I'm going to contribute a soup.

1904
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:06,752
So I'm going to that folder.

1905
01:13:10,076 --> 01:13:11,978
So we have a mushroom soup already.

1906
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:14,558
So again, I'm making sure that

1907
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:20,285
I'm in the correct repository here.

1908
01:13:20,285 --> 01:13:22,528
So here it says that I

1909
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:26,873
have copied from the place that

1910
01:13:26,873 --> 01:13:28,515
we forked from, but I had to

1911
01:13:28,515 --> 01:13:30,378
make sure that I'm in my place.

1912
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:32,180
And then what I will do

1913
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:34,483
is that I would click on this.

1914
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:37,046
If you see this button, it says add file.

1915
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:38,208
Do you see this, [name]?

1916
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,149
Yeah, I see that.

1917
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:39,449
Yeah.

1918
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,832
So then I would say create a file.

1919
01:13:44,393 --> 01:13:47,417
So in the creator file place, I'm going to,

1920
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:51,842
you know, some recipe for the

1921
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:54,185
sake of like showing the Git,

1922
01:13:54,185 --> 01:13:56,488
you know, not to show my recipe skills.

1923
01:13:56,488 --> 01:13:59,532
I'm going to copy something from the web.

1924
01:13:59,532 --> 01:14:09,625
So that's a simple and creamy carrot soup.

1925
01:14:11,663 --> 01:14:12,124
Right.

1926
01:14:12,124 --> 01:14:15,689
So get this characters

1927
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:18,353
correct, period, simple and,

1928
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,695
you know, correct.

1929
01:14:19,695 --> 01:14:21,818
So should I increase the font

1930
01:14:21,818 --> 01:14:22,620
a little bit, maybe?

1931
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,142
Yeah, I think it's better to increase.

1932
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:26,666
Yeah.

1933
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:27,427
How is it now?

1934
01:14:27,427 --> 01:14:28,108
Yeah, it's good.

1935
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:28,649
Yes.

1936
01:14:28,649 --> 01:14:29,991
So then I need the ingredients.

1937
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:32,354
I'm going to cheat a little bit.

1938
01:14:32,354 --> 01:14:33,837
So I'm going to copy the ingredients now.

1939
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:35,499
Right.

1940
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:36,781
So they are this this ingredients.

1941
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:39,325
And then the instructions.

1942
01:14:41,178 --> 01:14:42,601
Uh, instructions also, I'm going

1943
01:14:42,601 --> 01:14:43,983
to copy it.

1944
01:14:43,983 --> 01:14:45,707
Yeah.

1945
01:14:45,707 --> 01:14:49,474
So this is the content of my, um, file.

1946
01:14:49,474 --> 01:14:50,516
So I'm going to go

1947
01:14:50,516 --> 01:14:55,626
size, write something like, um, tasty soup.

1948
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:58,092
then you need a file name here

1949
01:14:58,092 --> 01:15:01,899
so the file name I would say

1950
01:15:01,899 --> 01:15:05,706
that this is a markdown file

1951
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:07,730
so that is the document I'm going

1952
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,733
to it could be a text file for example

1953
01:15:09,733 --> 01:15:11,136
but as we discussed before the

1954
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:12,418
git we don't version control

1955
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,404
like you know complex document

1956
01:15:15,404 --> 01:15:17,648
types like pdfs and docs and all

1957
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,778
I'm going to call it MD

1958
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:22,141
to indicate that it's a markdown.

1959
01:15:22,141 --> 01:15:24,424
When you indicate that the file type,

1960
01:15:24,424 --> 01:15:26,968
for example, Python, C, Git

1961
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:29,031
actually try to interpret that file

1962
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:30,272
and you can actually see the

1963
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:32,075
preview, how it looks like.

1964
01:15:32,075 --> 01:15:34,178
For example, if I show you

1965
01:15:34,178 --> 01:15:36,962
this hash here and these two hashes,

1966
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:38,003
which means a subheading and

1967
01:15:38,003 --> 01:15:44,240
a heading, GitHub figured out it's a

1968
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,844
um heading and it make

1969
01:15:46,844 --> 01:15:49,628
the heading bigger like this um

1970
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,589
and then you can see the

1971
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:52,312
preview so this magic happened

1972
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:53,594
because i named the file it

1973
01:15:53,594 --> 01:15:56,578
used the file extension so then uh

1974
01:15:56,578 --> 01:15:58,241
what we do is i will go

1975
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:00,964
here i'll click on this commit

1976
01:16:00,964 --> 01:16:02,206
button you see this green

1977
01:16:02,206 --> 01:16:04,590
commit button here yeah i will i

1978
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,232
will do the so the commit is

1979
01:16:06,232 --> 01:16:08,607
to i'm going to make that permanent

1980
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:10,870
and then you see that that

1981
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,773
new branch i created before the

1982
01:16:12,773 --> 01:16:14,235
break i created this branch so

1983
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:15,738
it's going to land on this

1984
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:24,010
not on the new branch um sap

1985
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,993
i'll type a small message and

1986
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:27,912
this is this will be the

1987
01:16:27,912 --> 01:16:30,895
message on the if you see

1988
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:31,996
that in the in the hash there

1989
01:16:31,996 --> 01:16:34,197
was a small like a short

1990
01:16:34,197 --> 01:16:36,700
message short log message so this is

1991
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,761
what going to appear so

1992
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:39,922
instead of this file name I'm

1993
01:16:39,922 --> 01:16:41,544
going to say carrot soup so that is

1994
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:42,865
what will appear in the log

1995
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,706
message then I would say

1996
01:16:44,706 --> 01:16:51,312
create commit the changes do

1997
01:16:51,312 --> 01:16:53,734
you want to discover no

1998
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:54,895
let's let's commit again maybe

1999
01:16:54,895 --> 01:16:56,957
it didn't happen properly commit

2000
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,101
Maybe it's trying to navigate to

2001
01:17:02,101 --> 01:17:04,143
a new tab, but let's see.

2002
01:17:07,786 --> 01:17:08,367
Let's try again.

2003
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:13,591
Okay, now we faced an error.

2004
01:17:13,591 --> 01:17:15,593
This was not planned, but

2005
01:17:15,593 --> 01:17:19,957
the error was that git actually committed

2006
01:17:19,957 --> 01:17:21,638
when I clicked the commit button before,

2007
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,161
but due to some redirection in the browser,

2008
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,803
it didn't actually give

2009
01:17:27,803 --> 01:17:29,843
me enough information that it has happened.

2010
01:17:29,843 --> 01:17:31,606
So I tried to do it again,

2011
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,349
but now Git has deleted a

2012
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:35,752
file with the same name already exists.

2013
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:38,056
So that's additional help that

2014
01:17:38,056 --> 01:17:41,001
we got from GitHub, not the Git itself,

2015
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:42,824
but GitHub, that it went

2016
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,268
and detected that there's a file

2017
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:46,409
that we don't want to commit.

2018
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,693
And then...

2019
01:17:48,693 --> 01:17:49,995
it's give me some option, you

2020
01:17:49,995 --> 01:17:51,056
know what to do.

2021
01:17:51,056 --> 01:17:54,361
So I'm going to now do a cancel here.

2022
01:17:54,361 --> 01:17:55,823
I would have preferred that

2023
01:17:55,823 --> 01:17:56,704
I didn't have to do it.

2024
01:17:56,704 --> 01:17:59,247
But you know, some technical

2025
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:00,489
problems I didn't.

2026
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:02,051
But you might you might also

2027
01:18:02,051 --> 01:18:03,894
see that if there's some delay.

2028
01:18:03,894 --> 01:18:06,377
So I'm going back to the recipe book now.

2029
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:08,901
Now the git will say

2030
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:10,082
there's unsafe changes.

2031
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:13,106
But GitHub said that it committed.

2032
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,730
So let's say okay, let's see what happens.

2033
01:18:19,186 --> 01:18:20,507
then I will go to the soups.

2034
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:27,234
And then if you can see

2035
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:30,878
here, that file I committed is not here.

2036
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,901
Could you guess why it's not here?

2037
01:18:37,304 --> 01:18:37,785
What do you think?

2038
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:38,766
Maybe because you are in

2039
01:18:38,766 --> 01:18:39,927
a different branch?

2040
01:18:39,927 --> 01:18:40,768
Correct.

2041
01:18:40,768 --> 01:18:43,310
So in the main branch, that

2042
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:44,131
file is not there.

2043
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:48,363
So it's in the...

2044
01:18:48,363 --> 01:18:50,786
new recipe branch, right?

2045
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:52,368
So the thing I wanted to show

2046
01:18:52,368 --> 01:18:53,889
before the exercise is that how

2047
01:18:53,889 --> 01:18:55,852
to create a branch and how to

2048
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:57,774
place a file in a specific branch.

2049
01:18:59,436 --> 01:19:00,497
And we also saw

2050
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:03,100
like unexpectedly encountered error.

2051
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,802
So when I- [name].

2052
01:19:04,802 --> 01:19:05,002
Yes.

2053
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:08,747
I think a few people from

2054
01:19:08,747 --> 01:19:11,970
Denmark lost the live connection.

2055
01:19:12,952 --> 01:19:13,642
Okay.

2056
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:17,106
so maybe can we take uh some questions

2057
01:19:17,106 --> 01:19:18,087
if there are any questions

2058
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,889
in the collaborator notes in

2059
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:21,672
the main right okay yeah

2060
01:19:21,672 --> 01:19:23,073
now they're back actually they're

2061
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:29,161
back okay yeah they're back okay

2062
01:19:29,161 --> 01:19:31,163
so then um what we do is

2063
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:33,065
we'll go to the exercise now so

2064
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:34,146
we are we are in this the

2065
01:19:34,146 --> 01:19:36,489
main lesson page and we are

2066
01:19:36,489 --> 01:19:38,772
going to the commit committing lesson

2067
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,845
And then I kind of showed

2068
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:45,915
the branch and the commit to start with.

2069
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:48,964
Now you have to practice yourself

2070
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:49,525
how to do it.

2071
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:53,999
And the exercise is for 20 minutes.

2072
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,343
And what you should do is,

2073
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:58,129
First, make sure you're on your fork.

2074
01:19:58,129 --> 01:19:59,590
So that I showed several times

2075
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:02,053
there on the top that I'm not in the main,

2076
01:20:02,053 --> 01:20:03,254
the place where I forked it

2077
01:20:03,254 --> 01:20:04,975
from, or we call this

2078
01:20:04,975 --> 01:20:07,078
upstream in technical sense.

2079
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:09,420
You had to be on your fork

2080
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,401
or the copy you made.

2081
01:20:11,282 --> 01:20:12,403
First, create a new branch.

2082
01:20:13,304 --> 01:20:17,407
That also, I did in a way, you know,

2083
01:20:17,407 --> 01:20:18,609
the clicked on the main,

2084
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:19,690
the place where that branch

2085
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,691
symbol is and created one.

2086
01:20:21,672 --> 01:20:23,153
And then...

2087
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:26,951
you have to modify a recipe

2088
01:20:26,951 --> 01:20:29,514
you just added so um so

2089
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:31,196
first you need to create a new new branch

2090
01:20:31,196 --> 01:20:34,219
and add a recipe so like i did

2091
01:20:34,219 --> 01:20:35,981
but then you have to modify

2092
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:37,683
that recipe a little bit so

2093
01:20:37,683 --> 01:20:40,687
first you commit it and then you modify

2094
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:43,450
that file then you have to

2095
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:44,751
switch back to the main branch

2096
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:47,655
uh by clicking on the top

2097
01:20:47,655 --> 01:20:49,036
browser i could go back again

2098
01:20:49,036 --> 01:20:52,698
uh to the reserve the the

2099
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:54,460
Could you maybe repeat?

2100
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:57,483
I think a few people are

2101
01:20:57,483 --> 01:21:02,369
saying like a bit fast or something like that.

2102
01:21:02,369 --> 01:21:02,649
Okay.

2103
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:04,491
Let's see.

2104
01:21:04,491 --> 01:21:05,753
Okay.

2105
01:21:05,753 --> 01:21:08,856
So here first, you have to

2106
01:21:08,856 --> 01:21:10,518
make sure you're in the correct fork.

2107
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:11,920
Okay.

2108
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,681
Right?

2109
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:14,443
So the fork is this.

2110
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:18,227
So if you see, for example,

2111
01:21:18,227 --> 01:21:20,761
here, if I click it,

2112
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:21,662
Click this one.

2113
01:21:21,662 --> 01:21:22,804
This is the upstream, the way

2114
01:21:22,804 --> 01:21:23,805
I copied it from.

2115
01:21:23,805 --> 01:21:25,206
You shouldn't work here.

2116
01:21:25,206 --> 01:21:26,748
So instead, you should work

2117
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:29,712
on your fork, the copy you created.

2118
01:21:29,712 --> 01:21:31,574
Then you have to go and

2119
01:21:31,574 --> 01:21:34,037
click the main branch and create

2120
01:21:34,037 --> 01:21:35,960
a branch from that place.

2121
01:21:37,842 --> 01:21:38,723
Right?

2122
01:21:38,723 --> 01:21:38,823
Yes.

2123
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:40,185
As I did, I created

2124
01:21:40,185 --> 01:21:42,968
this subreddit recipe branch.

2125
01:21:42,968 --> 01:21:44,089
So after that, I'm going

2126
01:21:44,089 --> 01:21:45,771
back to the lesson.

2127
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:48,154
After that, you have to do as I did,

2128
01:21:50,436 --> 01:21:52,699
contribute a recipe to your branch,

2129
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,262
and then you have to open

2130
01:21:55,262 --> 01:21:57,544
it up again and do some modification.

2131
01:21:57,544 --> 01:22:00,327
Then after modifying that, you

2132
01:22:00,327 --> 01:22:01,609
have to come back to the main branch.

2133
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:03,571
So you'll have to switch again here.

2134
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:09,117
So first you do is that

2135
01:22:09,117 --> 01:22:10,258
you work on this branch,

2136
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,564
create a file and commit it

2137
01:22:14,564 --> 01:22:16,146
open it up again and edit

2138
01:22:16,146 --> 01:22:17,889
it and then commit again and

2139
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:18,930
then switch back to the main

2140
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:24,258
branch and then change uh

2141
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:29,445
change change modify a recipe there so the

2142
01:22:30,927 --> 01:22:33,972
As you also show briefly,

2143
01:22:33,972 --> 01:22:36,135
the file I committed is not

2144
01:22:36,135 --> 01:22:37,958
there in the main branch.

2145
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,561
It's in the branch that I created.

2146
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:40,562
So when you switch back to

2147
01:22:40,562 --> 01:22:42,365
the main branch, you would not

2148
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:46,131
see the file you created.

2149
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:47,052
But soon you have to

2150
01:22:47,052 --> 01:22:49,797
modify something in the main branch.

2151
01:22:49,797 --> 01:22:52,100
To make things easier, I would

2152
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,045
say go and modify something in the

2153
01:22:56,071 --> 01:23:00,590
the sites for maybe, for

2154
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:03,060
example, inside sites, you have this

2155
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:05,579
Gokomole file.

2156
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:07,341
So modify that Gokomole file.

2157
01:23:07,341 --> 01:23:08,802
Here it doesn't specify which

2158
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:09,904
file, but you know, it's okay.

2159
01:23:09,904 --> 01:23:11,566
You can select whichever you want,

2160
01:23:11,566 --> 01:23:12,907
but maybe you could, if you

2161
01:23:12,907 --> 01:23:14,729
don't have a preference, go

2162
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:17,072
and modify the Gokomole file

2163
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:19,174
and then follow the instructions

2164
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:22,078
as even here from five onwards,

2165
01:23:23,299 --> 01:23:26,803
maybe at least number seven.

2166
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,185
You could come, but this will

2167
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:33,668
also, we will check after you arrive back.

2168
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,012
Is that clear enough, [name],

2169
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,753
or do you want to say something?

2170
01:23:38,753 --> 01:23:40,315
Yeah, it's clear, yes.

2171
01:23:41,436 --> 01:23:41,536
Yes.

2172
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:42,597
So you go here, go to

2173
01:23:42,597 --> 01:23:45,740
your fork, create a branch, create a file,

2174
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:48,663
modify it, and then go back

2175
01:23:48,663 --> 01:23:50,245
to the main branch, modify

2176
01:23:50,245 --> 01:23:52,587
something in that branch, and

2177
01:23:52,587 --> 01:23:53,969
then commit that, and then

2178
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:55,390
follow the instructions.

2179
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,128
there's anything unclear we

2180
01:23:58,128 --> 01:24:01,777
could discuss in the notes yeah for suppose

2181
01:24:01,777 --> 01:24:04,523
if yes so what we do is exercise

2182
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:06,227
until 20 minutes so we'll give

2183
01:24:06,227 --> 01:24:09,114
a 20 minutes exercise now uh

2184
01:24:09,114 --> 01:24:11,559
starting now and uh bye for

2185
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:13,745
now but we'll meet after 20

2186
01:24:13,745 --> 01:24:15,268
minutes to discuss the answers

2187
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:19,686
We'll come back.

2188
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:20,847
I see there were some

2189
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,151
questions regarding the exercise as well.

2190
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:25,514
So what I'll try to do is

2191
01:24:25,514 --> 01:24:28,098
I'll keep in mind the questions

2192
01:24:28,098 --> 01:24:30,782
and I will try to go

2193
01:24:30,782 --> 01:24:32,003
through the solutions and try to

2194
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:33,846
explain them at the same time.

2195
01:24:33,846 --> 01:24:36,229
And when we come back, you

2196
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:37,711
could point me to the things I missed.

2197
01:24:37,711 --> 01:24:40,295
Okay, sure.

2198
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:44,441
So we were in this...

2199
01:24:45,771 --> 01:24:48,413
repository, which is a fork or

2200
01:24:48,413 --> 01:24:50,575
a copy from the Code

2201
01:24:50,575 --> 01:24:52,717
Refinery CR workshop exercise

2202
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:53,658
recipe book branch.

2203
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,662
As you can see, to find

2204
01:24:57,662 --> 01:24:58,983
out which branch you are in,

2205
01:24:58,983 --> 01:25:00,044
there was a question on how to

2206
01:25:00,044 --> 01:25:01,486
find out where I am.

2207
01:25:01,486 --> 01:25:03,968
The best way is to look

2208
01:25:03,968 --> 01:25:07,531
here, and also the URL on the top.

2209
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:08,552
I'm not sure, yeah, you could

2210
01:25:08,552 --> 01:25:09,673
see the URL as well.

2211
01:25:09,673 --> 01:25:10,574
So in the URL, it will

2212
01:25:10,574 --> 01:25:13,177
say GitHub, my name, and

2213
01:25:13,177 --> 01:25:14,698
then the repository name.

2214
01:25:16,602 --> 01:25:20,287
And then the first thing in the exercise,

2215
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:21,809
what we were supposed to do

2216
01:25:21,809 --> 01:25:23,491
in the first one is to make.

2217
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:26,174
Let me check.

2218
01:25:26,174 --> 01:25:29,819
Make sure you are on the on your same fork.

2219
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:30,760
Same fork.

2220
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,222
So this we make sure.

2221
01:25:32,222 --> 01:25:34,124
Was that clear enough that to

2222
01:25:34,124 --> 01:25:38,210
how to find out about that?

2223
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:38,610
Yes.

2224
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:44,057
Then the second point they're

2225
01:25:44,057 --> 01:25:46,538
asking is was to create a new branch, was it?

2226
01:25:46,538 --> 01:25:47,140
Yes.

2227
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,907
Yes.

2228
01:25:48,907 --> 01:25:50,633
There was one question as well.

2229
01:25:50,633 --> 01:25:53,490
When the branch was created,

2230
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:57,475
somebody already saw some commits

2231
01:25:57,475 --> 01:26:00,017
and that person wondering

2232
01:26:00,017 --> 01:26:02,600
whether somebody has modified

2233
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,764
the original, the upstream version.

2234
01:26:05,764 --> 01:26:08,667
So the upstream version would be,

2235
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,249
even if it is modified, if

2236
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,272
you don't click this button

2237
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:14,754
here, the sync fork.

2238
01:26:14,754 --> 01:26:15,776
So this is a sync fork

2239
01:26:15,776 --> 01:26:17,457
means to sync with upstream.

2240
01:26:17,457 --> 01:26:20,254
If you have not clicked that,

2241
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:22,417
whatever done upstream will not

2242
01:26:22,417 --> 01:26:25,402
arrive to your repository.

2243
01:26:25,402 --> 01:26:27,044
Most likely thing that might

2244
01:26:27,044 --> 01:26:29,328
have happened is that when you

2245
01:26:29,328 --> 01:26:30,950
wrote your name of your

2246
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:33,334
branch, maybe you selected one

2247
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:35,297
already created instead of creating your own.

2248
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,361
For example, if I go here and

2249
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:46,734
if I try to create a new recipe,

2250
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:48,983
That branch is already there,

2251
01:26:48,983 --> 01:26:54,272
but my intention is to create

2252
01:26:54,272 --> 01:26:57,978
a new branch, but that one was already there.

2253
01:26:57,978 --> 01:26:59,521
When I clicked, instead of

2254
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:00,903
creating a new branch, I

2255
01:27:00,903 --> 01:27:02,906
switched to that branch instead.

2256
01:27:02,906 --> 01:27:05,030
So then if I go to the

2257
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:09,617
soups, I will see that carrot soup.

2258
01:27:11,048 --> 01:27:13,011
so again i'll go back to

2259
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:16,896
the the front the the main

2260
01:27:16,896 --> 01:27:19,260
page of the repository and then

2261
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,563
i'll create a new repo new branch

2262
01:27:21,563 --> 01:27:28,433
so the new branch i'll create uh soup 2

2263
01:27:28,433 --> 01:27:30,155
for example then it will

2264
01:27:30,155 --> 01:27:32,719
say create branch and when i

2265
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,863
switch to that branch i should

2266
01:27:35,863 --> 01:27:40,430
not see that carrot soup but let's see

2267
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:42,635
As you can see, it's

2268
01:27:42,635 --> 01:27:43,397
only the mushroom soup.

2269
01:27:44,922 --> 01:27:46,688
But when I'm creating the branch,

2270
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,634
if I had created it from

2271
01:27:48,634 --> 01:27:50,038
my previous branch instead of

2272
01:27:50,038 --> 01:27:52,240
the main branch, then

2273
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:57,025
my carrot soup would also be here.

2274
01:27:57,025 --> 01:27:58,506
So a branch could also

2275
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:00,688
be created from another branch.

2276
01:28:00,688 --> 01:28:01,509
So it doesn't have to be

2277
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:02,390
from a main branch.

2278
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:04,752
So that one thing that

2279
01:28:04,752 --> 01:28:08,696
might have happened during the exercise.

2280
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:10,178
So there are a few things to figure out.

2281
01:28:10,178 --> 01:28:11,820
I think everything you've figured

2282
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,581
out is a learning experience.

2283
01:28:13,581 --> 01:28:17,365
And what was the third question, Iman?

2284
01:28:17,365 --> 01:28:18,046
It was to create?

2285
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,268
New commit, basically.

2286
01:28:20,268 --> 01:28:21,269
New commit, okay.

2287
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:21,369
Yeah.

2288
01:28:22,328 --> 01:28:24,492
okay so i'm going to soup too

2289
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:31,343
and then i'm going to go to the branch

2290
01:28:32,886 --> 01:28:34,228
and then if you remember that

2291
01:28:34,228 --> 01:28:36,973
i said create a new file i

2292
01:28:36,973 --> 01:28:38,195
could also upload a file from

2293
01:28:38,195 --> 01:28:41,240
my computer then create a file

2294
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:45,667
for the sake of explanation i'm

2295
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:47,390
going to just call it um

2296
01:28:48,805 --> 01:28:50,328
Carrot soup.

2297
01:28:50,328 --> 01:28:50,608
Yeah.

2298
01:28:51,509 --> 01:28:52,832
Carrot soup.

2299
01:28:52,832 --> 01:28:53,513
It's already there.

2300
01:28:53,513 --> 01:28:55,736
So I'm going to call it 2.md.

2301
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,082
And then I'm going to cheat

2302
01:28:59,082 --> 01:29:03,329
a little bit and copy those must-have fields.

2303
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:06,314
Recipe.

2304
01:29:06,314 --> 01:29:12,564
Carrot soup 2.

2305
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:13,766
Ingredients.

2306
01:29:17,779 --> 01:29:19,801
carrots and water.

2307
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:25,888
For the instructions, I will just boil it.

2308
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:30,413
Not a great recipe, but

2309
01:29:30,413 --> 01:29:32,114
you know, don't judge me for the recipe.

2310
01:29:32,114 --> 01:29:35,358
Just focus on the git part of it.

2311
01:29:35,358 --> 01:29:37,801
I will go and see the review.

2312
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:39,442
So, it looks good.

2313
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:42,546
Then I should commit that.

2314
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:44,208
When I committing it, it will

2315
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:45,609
commit to the soup2 branch.

2316
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:49,586
new soup.

2317
01:29:49,586 --> 01:29:54,573
So if you include some detailed details

2318
01:29:54,573 --> 01:29:55,635
for the person who's reading

2319
01:29:55,635 --> 01:29:56,416
it, it'll be helpful.

2320
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,779
You could write some detail about it here.

2321
01:29:58,779 --> 01:30:05,208
I'm writing create a carrot soup.

2322
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:10,114
I would say simple alternate

2323
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:14,280
view and commit to this branch.

2324
01:30:17,601 --> 01:30:21,265
Again, that message of

2325
01:30:21,265 --> 01:30:22,887
not redirected properly.

2326
01:30:22,887 --> 01:30:26,510
Then in the fourth question, I

2327
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:27,411
was asked to modify.

2328
01:30:27,411 --> 01:30:28,633
Was it, Iman?

2329
01:30:28,633 --> 01:30:30,475
Oh, the same file, was it?

2330
01:30:30,475 --> 01:30:32,637
Yes, you have to modify the same file.

2331
01:30:32,637 --> 01:30:35,540
Yeah, same file I should modify.

2332
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:38,323
So I would open this file

2333
01:30:38,323 --> 01:30:42,507
and I will click this edit button.

2334
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:44,029
Do you see the edit pencil here?

2335
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:47,149
Yeah, maybe could you zoom a bit there?

2336
01:30:47,149 --> 01:30:50,192
yeah okay so I'll go back

2337
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:53,395
yeah yeah it's good and then

2338
01:30:53,395 --> 01:30:55,117
I'll click on the file that I

2339
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:58,540
want to edit then I will say

2340
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:02,504
uh there's a pencil button somewhere

2341
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:03,625
I had to zoom out a little

2342
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:04,385
bit because I don't see the

2343
01:31:04,385 --> 01:31:07,688
pencil yeah here I think it

2344
01:31:07,688 --> 01:31:10,131
should be yeah and then I

2345
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:15,196
would say maybe salt and then

2346
01:31:15,196 --> 01:31:16,717
I would again click

2347
01:31:17,558 --> 01:31:20,702
this button commit changes and

2348
01:31:20,702 --> 01:31:24,167
here I would say and noted

2349
01:31:26,049 --> 01:31:34,781
salt updated salt and then commit that.

2350
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:41,350
So, in that branch I would

2351
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:44,592
see that this is salt is also added.

2352
01:31:44,592 --> 01:31:47,576
Then I was asked to browse the network.

2353
01:31:47,576 --> 01:31:48,898
So what I'll do is.

2354
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:51,521
I think you have to go to the main.

2355
01:31:52,442 --> 01:31:52,703
Okay.

2356
01:31:52,703 --> 01:31:53,224
Main branch.

2357
01:31:53,224 --> 01:31:53,464
Okay.

2358
01:31:53,464 --> 01:31:53,804
Yeah.

2359
01:31:53,804 --> 01:31:55,787
And modify one file there.

2360
01:31:55,787 --> 01:31:56,508
Modify one file.

2361
01:31:56,508 --> 01:31:56,748
Okay.

2362
01:31:56,748 --> 01:31:57,469
Thank you.

2363
01:31:57,469 --> 01:31:58,571
So then I will go back

2364
01:31:58,571 --> 01:32:02,296
to the main branch here by clicking on the main.

2365
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:10,266
And that was actually a

2366
01:32:10,266 --> 01:32:11,808
very good thing happened.

2367
01:32:11,808 --> 01:32:13,130
I'll do that again to show you.

2368
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:15,329
I'm going to soups.

2369
01:32:18,513 --> 01:32:19,755
And I'm going to change back

2370
01:32:19,755 --> 01:32:21,017
to that soup two branch.

2371
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:27,505
And I'm going to click this carrot soup.

2372
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:28,426
And I'm going to change to

2373
01:32:28,426 --> 01:32:29,568
the main branch here.

2374
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,851
Now it's going to throw an error.

2375
01:32:31,851 --> 01:32:36,758
See whether you can see that error.

2376
01:32:36,758 --> 01:32:37,979
It says page not found,

2377
01:32:37,979 --> 01:32:39,281
which means that file is not

2378
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:40,823
there in the main branch, right?

2379
01:32:40,823 --> 01:32:42,345
So that was the reason.

2380
01:32:42,345 --> 01:32:44,245
So then I'll go to...

2381
01:32:44,245 --> 01:32:48,151
the main the root folder

2382
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:53,318
of that repository and then I will go to sites,

2383
01:32:55,802 --> 01:32:57,545
I will go to the guacamole

2384
01:32:57,545 --> 01:33:03,874
recipe and then edit this and

2385
01:33:03,874 --> 01:33:11,265
I will add maybe make 2 tablespoons of salt.

2386
01:33:13,017 --> 01:33:20,411
and then press commit changes.

2387
01:33:32,575 --> 01:33:35,058
I added a message for log message

2388
01:33:35,058 --> 01:33:37,440
and then I clicked on the...

2389
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,581
Do you see my microphone where

2390
01:33:38,581 --> 01:33:39,622
my mouse pointer is, Saman?

2391
01:33:39,622 --> 01:33:41,384
Or is it not clear that much?

2392
01:33:41,384 --> 01:33:43,366
Yeah, but yes, now I can see that.

2393
01:33:43,366 --> 01:33:47,590
I see the commit.

2394
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,651
Again, my browser is not

2395
01:33:48,651 --> 01:33:49,752
directly reading properly.

2396
01:33:49,752 --> 01:33:50,193
That's fine.

2397
01:33:55,318 --> 01:33:57,060
Now it's two tablespoons.

2398
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,781
So next one is the network, right?

2399
01:33:58,781 --> 01:34:00,621
Yes, next one is the network.

2400
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:02,704
Then I will go to Insights.

2401
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:04,326
So if your browser is a

2402
01:34:04,326 --> 01:34:07,891
little more zoomed out, then you

2403
01:34:07,891 --> 01:34:09,212
will see the button.

2404
01:34:09,212 --> 01:34:12,217
But here, you will see a

2405
01:34:12,217 --> 01:34:13,779
menu entry called Insight.

2406
01:34:13,779 --> 01:34:19,246
Go to Insight and click on Network.

2407
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:24,173
Then you see, as many of

2408
01:34:24,173 --> 01:34:26,275
you experience, it sometimes takes

2409
01:34:26,275 --> 01:34:28,043
time to render this.

2410
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:30,546
So when I copied from

2411
01:34:30,546 --> 01:34:32,929
the upstream, I copied all the branches.

2412
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:34,111
So if I had copied only

2413
01:34:34,111 --> 01:34:37,315
the main branch, then I would not see.

2414
01:34:37,315 --> 01:34:38,496
But these are all the

2415
01:34:38,496 --> 01:34:40,599
changes that were done in the

2416
01:34:40,599 --> 01:34:42,161
past in that repository.

2417
01:34:42,161 --> 01:34:43,363
So I see all the changes.

2418
01:34:44,644 --> 01:34:47,628
So I see this my change here.

2419
01:34:47,628 --> 01:34:53,055
We have to rotate our head.

2420
01:34:53,996 --> 01:34:55,118
What is that?

2421
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:57,152
We have to rotate our head.

2422
01:34:57,152 --> 01:35:00,198
yes so let me check where my branches

2423
01:35:00,198 --> 01:35:02,442
so this is here you see if

2424
01:35:02,442 --> 01:35:03,544
it came from the main branch

2425
01:35:04,586 --> 01:35:06,449
they were here yeah and then

2426
01:35:06,449 --> 01:35:10,577
i have done some changes and

2427
01:35:10,577 --> 01:35:13,462
then um the main branch itself

2428
01:35:14,885 --> 01:35:20,595
has moved um so this is the latest one

2429
01:35:22,212 --> 01:35:24,015
This is not the latest one.

2430
01:35:24,015 --> 01:35:26,019
Because you have two accounts, I think.

2431
01:35:26,019 --> 01:35:28,483
So this was the earlier one.

2432
01:35:28,483 --> 01:35:30,566
And this is now integrated.

2433
01:35:30,566 --> 01:35:35,435
The one I did now is this one.

2434
01:35:35,435 --> 01:35:37,138
Yeah.

2435
01:35:37,138 --> 01:35:38,120
So this is the main branch

2436
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,242
that has moved forward.

2437
01:35:39,242 --> 01:35:40,424
And this is the branch

2438
01:35:40,424 --> 01:35:41,926
I created, create correct sub

2439
01:35:41,926 --> 01:35:44,330
branch, and it's not joined yet.

2440
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,873
So the main branch has something.

2441
01:35:46,849 --> 01:35:49,452
the correct, the suggestion

2442
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,733
branch has something, but because

2443
01:35:50,733 --> 01:35:53,316
of this is now little, like

2444
01:35:53,316 --> 01:35:54,397
too many things are there.

2445
01:35:55,638 --> 01:35:56,899
Might be little complicated, but

2446
01:35:56,899 --> 01:36:00,423
the thing you should notice is that there is,

2447
01:36:00,423 --> 01:36:01,504
there are two commits, these

2448
01:36:01,504 --> 01:36:04,186
two dots, which are not in the main branch.

2449
01:36:05,027 --> 01:36:06,088
And there is this dot,

2450
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:07,570
the main branch, which is not

2451
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,231
in the blue branch.

2452
01:36:09,812 --> 01:36:12,675
So in the next part of the lesson

2453
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:14,317
that [name] would show you

2454
01:36:14,317 --> 01:36:16,363
how to combine this, right?

2455
01:36:16,363 --> 01:36:20,251
Yes.

2456
01:36:20,251 --> 01:36:20,491
Yeah.

2457
01:36:22,114 --> 01:36:23,818
So then what they're asking

2458
01:36:23,818 --> 01:36:26,704
switch to the main project, modify the recipe.

2459
01:36:26,704 --> 01:36:29,229
I've been the fifth question now.

2460
01:36:29,229 --> 01:36:30,972
Now we are in the seventh

2461
01:36:30,972 --> 01:36:34,098
because now we compared Okay,

2462
01:36:34,098 --> 01:36:36,225
compare the branch that you created.

2463
01:36:36,225 --> 01:36:36,946
Yeah.

2464
01:36:36,946 --> 01:36:37,526
With the main part.

2465
01:36:37,526 --> 01:36:39,368
So that comparison, we did

2466
01:36:39,368 --> 01:36:41,050
that visually, but there's a better

2467
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:41,750
way to do that.

2468
01:36:42,872 --> 01:36:48,177
Like we could use this URL to compare it.

2469
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:54,002
Here we use the, if you,

2470
01:36:54,002 --> 01:36:55,584
so this is a little tricky.

2471
01:36:55,584 --> 01:36:57,266
So if you see my URL,

2472
01:36:57,266 --> 01:37:00,989
maybe [name], could you reduce

2473
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:02,311
the video a little bit so

2474
01:37:02,311 --> 01:37:03,752
the URL will be visible?

2475
01:37:05,723 --> 01:37:08,507
Maybe even off the video for a while.

2476
01:37:08,507 --> 01:37:09,088
Oh, yes.

2477
01:37:09,088 --> 01:37:10,210
Yeah.

2478
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:14,797
In the top URL, you go to the recipe,

2479
01:37:14,797 --> 01:37:18,543
that repository, and then I

2480
01:37:18,543 --> 01:37:20,727
will post this in the shared

2481
01:37:20,727 --> 01:37:23,291
document and type compare.

2482
01:37:24,332 --> 01:37:26,135
The word compare, if you type compare,

2483
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,280
it opens up a way

2484
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,325
to compare the repositories.

2485
01:37:32,325 --> 01:37:34,056
What's the difference?

2486
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:36,559
for example with the main and

2487
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,764
the main I have so that

2488
01:37:40,764 --> 01:37:43,848
the top the repository is the upstream

2489
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:46,772
and the main I have there's one change

2490
01:37:46,772 --> 01:37:48,294
that I change sort but what

2491
01:37:48,294 --> 01:37:50,256
we want to do now is to

2492
01:37:50,256 --> 01:37:54,141
check the change between my

2493
01:37:55,743 --> 01:38:01,430
repository main and with the

2494
01:38:02,946 --> 01:38:04,308
soup to rest repository.

2495
01:38:06,231 --> 01:38:08,775
So is this a expected,

2496
01:38:08,775 --> 01:38:10,858
uh, change, uh, Haman or not?

2497
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:14,363
You are still in your repository, right?

2498
01:38:14,363 --> 01:38:16,106
In the main repository.

2499
01:38:16,106 --> 01:38:16,707
Yeah.

2500
01:38:16,707 --> 01:38:18,069
So I'm comparing with the main

2501
01:38:18,069 --> 01:38:19,952
branch of my repository, my, my

2502
01:38:19,952 --> 01:38:24,138
copy with the soup to a branch of my copy.

2503
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:27,243
So these are the two changes I did.

2504
01:38:27,243 --> 01:38:28,725
So it clearly shows that I

2505
01:38:29,786 --> 01:38:32,210
have added a file compared to the main branch.

2506
01:38:33,777 --> 01:38:39,269
But it did not show that I changed salt.

2507
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:42,135
Remember that I also changed salt.

2508
01:38:42,135 --> 01:38:43,277
So in order to do that,

2509
01:38:43,277 --> 01:38:44,941
you have to perform this

2510
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:46,284
comparison other way around.

2511
01:38:46,284 --> 01:38:48,789
So you have to select soup 2 here.

2512
01:38:51,254 --> 01:38:53,118
And then main here.

2513
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,963
In that comparison, it will

2514
01:38:56,963 --> 01:39:00,010
show that there's a difference of sort here.

2515
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:02,636
The green is added, red is removed.

2516
01:39:02,636 --> 01:39:05,682
So you have to make sure

2517
01:39:05,682 --> 01:39:09,518
the direction of comparison

2518
01:39:09,518 --> 01:39:11,783
to see the changes.

2519
01:39:11,783 --> 01:39:12,825
So there's a change.

2520
01:39:12,825 --> 01:39:14,569
There are some commits that are

2521
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:15,691
not in the main branch, but

2522
01:39:15,691 --> 01:39:17,976
in the SUP2 branch that I could see in one way.

2523
01:39:18,938 --> 01:39:20,642
And there are changes in the main branch,

2524
01:39:20,642 --> 01:39:22,465
which are not in the SUP2 branch

2525
01:39:22,465 --> 01:39:23,989
that also you could see, but

2526
01:39:23,989 --> 01:39:25,091
you have to make sure you

2527
01:39:25,091 --> 01:39:26,514
select the correct direction here.

2528
01:39:28,182 --> 01:39:32,926
also commits, you could compare

2529
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:34,568
in this way with this URL.

2530
01:39:36,049 --> 01:39:38,211
So, the way to compare is

2531
01:39:38,211 --> 01:39:40,313
that let us say we want to,

2532
01:39:40,313 --> 01:39:41,834
I will go to this repository,

2533
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:43,436
the base of that repository.

2534
01:39:44,617 --> 01:39:50,982
And I will go to the soups folder here.

2535
01:39:50,982 --> 01:39:57,882
And I will change back

2536
01:39:57,882 --> 01:40:01,185
to the soup two branch.

2537
01:40:01,185 --> 01:40:02,926
So then I see my carrot soup.

2538
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:04,247
So this is the place where

2539
01:40:04,247 --> 01:40:05,628
we did the changes.

2540
01:40:05,628 --> 01:40:10,232
So I will, the file and the change.

2541
01:40:10,232 --> 01:40:12,454
Then I will go here and

2542
01:40:12,454 --> 01:40:14,936
then I will click on blame.

2543
01:40:16,317 --> 01:40:17,659
So this showed that, you

2544
01:40:17,659 --> 01:40:19,740
know, I created this file, who

2545
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:21,942
created the file and then the

2546
01:40:21,942 --> 01:40:28,560
change I did by adding salt in this case.

2547
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,104
Now I want to find out

2548
01:40:30,104 --> 01:40:32,431
the commit hashes of this.

2549
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:33,353
Do you know how to?

2550
01:40:33,353 --> 01:40:34,737
I think you showed in your

2551
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:36,723
lesson how to find the commit hashes.

2552
01:40:36,723 --> 01:40:37,706
Do you remember?

2553
01:40:37,706 --> 01:40:39,591
Can you remind me again, [name]?

2554
01:40:39,591 --> 01:40:41,476
Was it history?

2555
01:40:41,476 --> 01:40:42,840
Yes, you can add this.

2556
01:40:45,486 --> 01:40:46,628
So here we want to

2557
01:40:46,628 --> 01:40:48,251
compare between these two versions.

2558
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,152
So I want to see

2559
01:40:49,152 --> 01:40:51,035
the difference between these two versions.

2560
01:40:51,035 --> 01:40:54,702
So what I will do is I will copy this hash,

2561
01:40:54,702 --> 01:40:56,124
but it will copy the entire

2562
01:40:56,124 --> 01:40:58,308
big, like the long string, but

2563
01:40:58,308 --> 01:41:00,471
I only need the seven strings in the beginning.

2564
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:05,019
Again, I need to go

2565
01:41:05,019 --> 01:41:09,787
here, recipe book, recorded, and

2566
01:41:09,787 --> 01:41:11,510
I have to remove all this.

2567
01:41:13,144 --> 01:41:14,726
and I typed compare.

2568
01:41:14,726 --> 01:41:16,368
So this, what I'm typing is

2569
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:17,309
given in the answer.

2570
01:41:17,309 --> 01:41:20,754
So I'm relying on that text

2571
01:41:20,754 --> 01:41:23,417
to be, you know, for you to reference.

2572
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:24,558
And then for this, I don't

2573
01:41:24,558 --> 01:41:26,481
need the whole hash.

2574
01:41:26,481 --> 01:41:28,583
I only need about seven, eight.

2575
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,965
It doesn't matter one, two,

2576
01:41:29,965 --> 01:41:34,130
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2577
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:34,671
Okay.

2578
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:36,433
Then you need two dots.

2579
01:41:36,433 --> 01:41:37,374
You can also remove zero.

2580
01:41:38,456 --> 01:41:38,696
Okay.

2581
01:41:39,942 --> 01:41:40,523
dots.

2582
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:41,443
So even if you have the

2583
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:42,244
zero, it doesn't matter.

2584
01:41:42,244 --> 01:41:45,728
But you need minimum of seven.

2585
01:41:45,728 --> 01:41:47,489
And I copy this hash.

2586
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:49,691
And I paste it.

2587
01:41:49,691 --> 01:41:51,413
I just paste it as it is.

2588
01:41:51,413 --> 01:41:52,794
I hope let me check whether

2589
01:41:52,794 --> 01:41:53,595
you can see that.

2590
01:41:54,656 --> 01:41:58,600
Yeah, I can see that on the screen.

2591
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,262
Yeah, so I'll copy this.

2592
01:42:00,262 --> 01:42:00,762
Yes.

2593
01:42:02,204 --> 01:42:04,126
And the text here is that

2594
01:42:04,126 --> 01:42:07,212
I'll go back to the

2595
01:42:07,212 --> 01:42:10,858
our lesson material.

2596
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:12,000
I can show you again.

2597
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,921
Then I press enter.

2598
01:42:16,147 --> 01:42:17,489
Then it will go and find

2599
01:42:17,489 --> 01:42:21,796
out the difference between those two hashes

2600
01:42:21,796 --> 01:42:23,419
or those two commits were that

2601
01:42:23,419 --> 01:42:28,267
one had sort and one did not have sort.

2602
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:33,455
So I'll go back to that the

2603
01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:37,282
and I will show you where it is written.

2604
01:42:39,464 --> 01:42:40,005
I am going to, I am

2605
01:42:40,005 --> 01:42:44,350
scrolling down, browse commits and

2606
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:45,992
then compare branches.

2607
01:42:45,992 --> 01:42:47,533
So, here you will see that command.

2608
01:42:47,533 --> 01:42:48,554
So, if you if you did not see

2609
01:42:48,554 --> 01:42:49,696
that on the URL, especially

2610
01:42:49,696 --> 01:42:51,558
on Twitch, it might be a little blurred.

2611
01:42:52,519 --> 01:42:54,041
The way you should type the

2612
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,562
URL is here and also

2613
01:42:55,562 --> 01:42:58,886
comparing arbitrary commits.

2614
01:43:00,064 --> 01:43:02,067
way I did was the repository's

2615
01:43:02,067 --> 01:43:04,351
name I typed compare in the front

2616
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:06,734
and the hashes that I copied

2617
01:43:06,734 --> 01:43:08,838
you could use the whole the cache

2618
01:43:08,838 --> 01:43:11,322
as it is that the hash as it is

2619
01:43:11,322 --> 01:43:13,024
or you know you minimum seven

2620
01:43:13,024 --> 01:43:17,411
needed to get that answer then

2621
01:43:17,411 --> 01:43:19,955
there is a rename your branch so

2622
01:43:19,955 --> 01:43:22,539
let's see if I go back here

2623
01:43:22,539 --> 01:43:26,325
I want to rename this branch that I created

2624
01:43:27,638 --> 01:43:29,300
For that, there are several ways

2625
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:31,944
to do this in the GitHub interface.

2626
01:43:31,944 --> 01:43:34,046
So the first thing is you

2627
01:43:34,046 --> 01:43:35,088
need to find the branch.

2628
01:43:35,088 --> 01:43:37,351
You could go and click on

2629
01:43:37,351 --> 01:43:40,054
your recipe to go to the home

2630
01:43:40,054 --> 01:43:43,539
page of this, the base of the repository.

2631
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:49,827
Then you could click this branches here.

2632
01:43:49,827 --> 01:43:53,102
Near main, you have this...

2633
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:56,106
tap for branches then you will

2634
01:43:56,106 --> 01:43:58,629
see all the branches that's the easiest way

2635
01:43:58,629 --> 01:44:00,811
for me to find out is

2636
01:44:00,811 --> 01:44:01,912
there any other way to find

2637
01:44:01,912 --> 01:44:07,039
the branch Iman I think if you

2638
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:10,062
go again the same place I mean

2639
01:44:10,062 --> 01:44:11,464
you can also look at view

2640
01:44:11,464 --> 01:44:14,868
all branches but if you click

2641
01:44:14,868 --> 01:44:18,452
on the main I think there is one last icon which

2642
01:44:19,444 --> 01:44:21,387
we've all branches yeah this

2643
01:44:21,387 --> 01:44:23,229
is other way but the one

2644
01:44:23,229 --> 01:44:25,031
you showed is much better in

2645
01:44:25,031 --> 01:44:27,975
terms of one click right here yeah

2646
01:44:27,975 --> 01:44:30,418
so you you have to come to this place

2647
01:44:30,418 --> 01:44:31,219
and let's say if you want

2648
01:44:31,219 --> 01:44:34,343
to rename this branch to a

2649
01:44:34,343 --> 01:44:36,026
little bit get some space here

2650
01:44:36,026 --> 01:44:37,407
because i can see all the

2651
01:44:37,407 --> 01:44:38,929
the buttons you have to go

2652
01:44:38,929 --> 01:44:42,334
here click on this three dots

2653
01:44:44,056 --> 01:44:47,741
and then rename the branch and

2654
01:44:47,741 --> 01:44:49,383
you could say soup three for example

2655
01:44:52,823 --> 01:44:55,426
And now it is called SUP3.

2656
01:44:55,426 --> 01:44:56,948
You might see, don't see it immediately.

2657
01:44:56,948 --> 01:44:57,809
You don't see it here,

2658
01:44:57,809 --> 01:44:59,731
but you could refresh the page

2659
01:45:01,894 --> 01:45:03,295
and you'll see that it's SUP3.

2660
01:45:05,658 --> 01:45:07,380
So that is how you rename the branch.

2661
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:09,603
And tag also you could create.

2662
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:12,446
So the tag is like when

2663
01:45:12,446 --> 01:45:14,068
you're publishing a paper, for

2664
01:45:14,068 --> 01:45:15,330
example, you could attach, you

2665
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:17,772
know, this is the version I published a paper.

2666
01:45:17,772 --> 01:45:19,274
Or if you are releasing a code base,

2667
01:45:19,274 --> 01:45:20,135
you could say, you know,

2668
01:45:20,135 --> 01:45:22,708
release one, release two, that kind of things.

2669
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:26,053
for that also you could go

2670
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:29,859
to the front page to your repository

2671
01:45:29,859 --> 01:45:30,680
and here there is this

2672
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,863
sticky tape sticky note kind of

2673
01:45:32,863 --> 01:45:36,408
thing tag then you could click that

2674
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:40,494
and then I have some one

2675
01:45:40,494 --> 01:45:43,078
tag here already created you could

2676
01:45:43,078 --> 01:45:45,542
create a tag by using releases

2677
01:45:48,526 --> 01:45:49,728
and then create a new release

2678
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,261
I'll call it release one.

2679
01:45:58,368 --> 01:46:02,434
Tag, I would say beta 01.

2680
01:46:04,016 --> 01:46:07,201
Usually, it'll be something

2681
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:11,346
like version one, for example, version B1.

2682
01:46:15,652 --> 01:46:16,273
It's a tag.

2683
01:46:16,273 --> 01:46:21,200
And then the version used in the

2684
01:46:22,935 --> 01:46:24,237
publication, for example.

2685
01:46:26,059 --> 01:46:28,161
And you are releasing the main one?

2686
01:46:29,823 --> 01:46:30,164
Yes.

2687
01:46:30,164 --> 01:46:32,827
So I'm going to release the main branch.

2688
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:35,170
Then you publish it.

2689
01:46:37,373 --> 01:46:40,076
So when that is done, you will see

2690
01:46:40,076 --> 01:46:42,759
that if I go to the front

2691
01:46:42,759 --> 01:46:47,325
page of this, if I click on

2692
01:46:47,325 --> 01:46:52,180
tags, I'll see that one I created as well.

2693
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:56,146
So, before we go for a

2694
01:46:56,146 --> 01:46:58,749
break, I could show some

2695
01:46:58,749 --> 01:46:59,731
discussions here as well.

2696
01:47:02,094 --> 01:47:04,758
You know, as part, so this,

2697
01:47:04,758 --> 01:47:06,160
you could have the branches.

2698
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,302
If only you are working,

2699
01:47:07,302 --> 01:47:08,563
you could also commit to the

2700
01:47:08,563 --> 01:47:09,405
main branch if you wish.

2701
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:14,632
You could commit to branches

2702
01:47:14,632 --> 01:47:16,695
if there are multiple lines of work at

2703
01:47:16,695 --> 01:47:17,636
once and you could want

2704
01:47:17,636 --> 01:47:19,980
them to interfere with each other.

2705
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:22,200
I mean,

2706
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,503
So to be honest, we don't

2707
01:47:25,503 --> 01:47:26,644
work with code this way.

2708
01:47:26,644 --> 01:47:28,766
We don't work on the browser this way.

2709
01:47:28,766 --> 01:47:30,467
Either we use the terminal or

2710
01:47:30,467 --> 01:47:35,591
we use the integrated development environment.

2711
01:47:35,591 --> 01:47:36,913
So in those environment,

2712
01:47:36,913 --> 01:47:38,914
we collect relevant changes together

2713
01:47:38,914 --> 01:47:39,975
when we make a commit.

2714
01:47:39,975 --> 01:47:42,637
So you don't just collect

2715
01:47:42,637 --> 01:47:44,459
some random files and make a commit.

2716
01:47:44,459 --> 01:47:48,442
So it's like a collection of files.

2717
01:47:48,442 --> 01:47:51,465
And then if you don't want to

2718
01:47:52,288 --> 01:47:55,312
some file to be like in the Git.

2719
01:47:55,312 --> 01:47:56,474
For example, maybe there's

2720
01:47:56,474 --> 01:47:57,835
some password file or maybe

2721
01:47:57,835 --> 01:47:59,938
if you're working with cloud,

2722
01:47:59,938 --> 01:48:02,902
there might be some like a

2723
01:48:02,902 --> 01:48:04,264
key that you are using for

2724
01:48:04,264 --> 01:48:05,926
testing so that you don't want to

2725
01:48:06,767 --> 01:48:09,171
send it to the GitHub.

2726
01:48:09,171 --> 01:48:10,933
Then there is this gitignore

2727
01:48:11,994 --> 01:48:13,597
that would be useful.

2728
01:48:13,597 --> 01:48:15,039
So everything that is included

2729
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:16,801
in the gitignore would not end

2730
01:48:16,801 --> 01:48:18,203
up in the GitHub.

2731
01:48:18,203 --> 01:48:21,367
So that's the end of that exercise.

2732
01:48:23,052 --> 01:48:24,855
And let me check the nodes.

2733
01:48:26,017 --> 01:48:27,019
Did I miss anything here?

2734
01:48:31,867 --> 01:48:34,451
What does it mean for one of the commits?

2735
01:48:34,451 --> 01:48:34,711
Okay.

2736
01:48:36,855 --> 01:48:38,478
So that is like the tag

2737
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:39,700
referred to a commit.

2738
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:41,282
So when I said the main branch

2739
01:48:41,282 --> 01:48:43,626
and created a tag, it created

2740
01:48:43,626 --> 01:48:46,511
the late tag on the latest commit.

2741
01:48:49,647 --> 01:48:51,329
uh where where did somebody

2742
01:48:51,329 --> 01:48:53,372
find the must have content for

2743
01:48:53,372 --> 01:48:55,755
the new file could my file

2744
01:48:56,576 --> 01:48:58,398
lacking this content means okay

2745
01:48:58,398 --> 01:48:59,940
so the must have content is

2746
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:04,786
there on the document um so if

2747
01:49:04,786 --> 01:49:09,832
you if you see this uh answers uh antique answer

2748
01:49:11,635 --> 01:49:15,702
under 2, number 2, you will

2749
01:49:15,702 --> 01:49:17,065
find this must have content.

2750
01:49:17,065 --> 01:49:19,269
You could also try misspelling

2751
01:49:19,269 --> 01:49:20,551
this and see what happens.

2752
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:24,337
And then the next one is

2753
01:49:24,337 --> 01:49:25,479
when trying to make a tag

2754
01:49:25,479 --> 01:49:27,483
and associated it with the commit.

2755
01:49:30,957 --> 01:49:32,620
This may be due to that

2756
01:49:33,542 --> 01:49:34,544
you're in a different branch.

2757
01:49:34,544 --> 01:49:36,648
So the latest commit might be in a branch.

2758
01:49:36,648 --> 01:49:37,409
You have to make sure that

2759
01:49:37,409 --> 01:49:38,691
you're in a branch.

2760
01:49:38,691 --> 01:49:40,194
If you try to tag it, if

2761
01:49:40,194 --> 01:49:41,076
you don't see a commit,

2762
01:49:41,937 --> 01:49:43,681
most likely scenario would, you

2763
01:49:43,681 --> 01:49:45,023
know, one scenario would be that

2764
01:49:45,023 --> 01:49:46,225
you might be in a different branch.

2765
01:49:52,337 --> 01:49:54,818
Okay, so these things we will

2766
01:49:54,818 --> 01:49:56,180
talk about a little bit

2767
01:49:56,180 --> 01:50:01,929
this in the collaborative version part as well.

2768
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:04,113
But I would think that now we go

2769
01:50:04,113 --> 01:50:06,737
for a break, [name], and when we come back,

2770
01:50:06,737 --> 01:50:09,461
we'll discuss more and we will

2771
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:12,265
see how to integrate this.

2772
01:50:12,265 --> 01:50:14,188
So then we can answer those questions.

2773
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:16,432
Somebody has used the term push here,

2774
01:50:16,432 --> 01:50:20,158
but first we need to merge

2775
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:23,218
this content to the main branch.

2776
01:50:23,218 --> 01:50:28,433
So now we break [name] for 10 minutes

2777
01:50:29,276 --> 01:50:30,740
and we'll come back and then

2778
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:31,864
when we come back, [name]

2779
01:50:31,864 --> 01:50:34,532
would continue the merging part

2780
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:36,217
and bye for now.

2781
01:50:43,296 --> 01:50:44,338
[name], I could hear you.

2782
01:50:51,753 --> 01:50:52,755
No, [name], can you hear him?

2783
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:57,925
Hey, I can hear you.

2784
01:50:57,925 --> 01:50:59,007
Can you hear Iman?

2785
01:50:59,849 --> 01:51:00,330
I guess not.

2786
01:51:01,131 --> 01:51:01,592
OK.

2787
01:51:06,246 --> 01:51:07,828
I think it's a network issue, maybe.

2788
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:09,951
Yeah, now I can hear you.

2789
01:51:09,951 --> 01:51:10,432
OK, fine.

2790
01:51:10,432 --> 01:51:11,454
Good, good.

2791
01:51:11,454 --> 01:51:12,555
OK, welcome back.

2792
01:51:12,555 --> 01:51:14,117
Welcome back from the break.

2793
01:51:14,117 --> 01:51:15,459
So yeah, this is the

2794
01:51:15,459 --> 01:51:18,704
last session today, which is about merging.

2795
01:51:18,704 --> 01:51:25,554
OK, so let me increase the screen, maybe.

2796
01:51:46,003 --> 01:51:50,830
Till now what we saw is like we did this,

2797
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:52,472
we started with looking at

2798
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:54,715
the existing repository and then

2799
01:51:54,715 --> 01:51:57,359
we forked the repository, which is

2800
01:51:57,359 --> 01:51:58,521
like we took a copy of it

2801
01:51:58,521 --> 01:52:01,205
and then we started editing it.

2802
01:52:01,205 --> 01:52:04,409
Now you try to add some new features

2803
01:52:04,409 --> 01:52:06,472
and now you want to like

2804
01:52:06,472 --> 01:52:08,515
push it back to the main repository.

2805
01:52:08,515 --> 01:52:10,638
So that is what you're going to do now.

2806
01:52:10,638 --> 01:52:13,462
So basically, yeah.

2807
01:52:14,961 --> 01:52:17,646
And just a quick remark, basically

2808
01:52:17,646 --> 01:52:19,008
when you are doing this

2809
01:52:19,008 --> 01:52:21,412
pushing emerging changes, so

2810
01:52:22,855 --> 01:52:24,317
you're satisfied with whatever the

2811
01:52:24,317 --> 01:52:25,900
fixes you made or what are

2812
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,423
the features you want to add,

2813
01:52:27,423 --> 01:52:28,745
now you want to propose the changes.

2814
01:52:29,727 --> 01:52:31,049
So that is what you are

2815
01:52:31,049 --> 01:52:34,435
here in your branch where you just forked

2816
01:52:34,435 --> 01:52:36,399
and added your new features and

2817
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:38,282
now you ask for a pull request.

2818
01:52:38,282 --> 01:52:41,467
which means that we are asking for,

2819
01:52:41,467 --> 01:52:43,831
we have these changes and

2820
01:52:43,831 --> 01:52:46,676
just include these changes in the main branch.

2821
01:52:48,218 --> 01:52:50,181
For this tutorial, we will

2822
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:52,305
stick with your own branch,

2823
01:52:52,305 --> 01:52:54,328
with your own repository.

2824
01:52:54,328 --> 01:52:57,934
Please don't push any changes

2825
01:52:57,934 --> 01:53:00,017
to the upstream recipe book.

2826
01:53:00,017 --> 01:53:03,184
There are three different ways

2827
01:53:03,184 --> 01:53:05,128
of doing this, but today we

2828
01:53:05,128 --> 01:53:06,511
will focus on the GitHub path,

2829
01:53:07,312 --> 01:53:08,956
and maybe in the coming days

2830
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:10,860
you will learn the other ways.

2831
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,365
If you are happy with the VS Code

2832
01:53:13,365 --> 01:53:15,089
or command line, you will

2833
01:53:16,331 --> 01:53:18,175
come across in the next few days.

2834
01:53:18,175 --> 01:53:18,976
Okay.

2835
01:53:18,976 --> 01:53:20,457
So here is the exercise.

2836
01:53:20,457 --> 01:53:21,518
And what you're going to do

2837
01:53:21,518 --> 01:53:26,603
is like, let's start with this branch.

2838
01:53:26,603 --> 01:53:29,346
So this is like the branch.

2839
01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:30,707
Currently, what you are looking is.

2840
01:53:36,392 --> 01:53:37,614
I'm losing sound.

2841
01:53:45,641 --> 01:53:46,342
No, I couldn't hear you.

2842
01:53:51,402 --> 01:53:52,645
I guess we have.

2843
01:53:52,645 --> 01:53:55,833
If you haven't created a new

2844
01:53:55,833 --> 01:53:57,096
recipe, try to create the new

2845
01:53:57,096 --> 01:53:59,682
recipe and then you now try

2846
01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:02,033
to do the pull request.

2847
01:54:02,033 --> 01:54:04,157
and to do the pull request

2848
01:54:04,157 --> 01:54:06,200
what you do is like you go

2849
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:08,604
to the main branch to the code

2850
01:54:08,604 --> 01:54:10,828
and then here you can see the contribute

2851
01:54:10,828 --> 01:54:12,491
and then you can look for

2852
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:15,816
the open pull request so that's

2853
01:54:15,816 --> 01:54:17,860
uh this is the exercise you are

2854
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:20,404
now you will be doing now so

2855
01:54:20,404 --> 01:54:24,030
we have uh say uh maybe

2856
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:25,673
[name] how many minutes like i

2857
01:54:25,673 --> 01:54:27,095
think we are running out of time

2858
01:54:29,725 --> 01:54:32,829
Uh, say 10 minutes so that

2859
01:54:32,829 --> 01:54:36,775
we have, uh, uh, yeah, say 10 50.

2860
01:54:36,775 --> 01:54:38,076
Yeah.

2861
01:54:38,076 --> 01:54:40,640
I can't hear you.

2862
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,382
So this exercise, uh, human,

2863
01:54:42,382 --> 01:54:43,744
you had to walk through because

2864
01:54:43,744 --> 01:54:47,529
of, um, yeah, so they can do it as homework.

2865
01:54:47,529 --> 01:54:48,731
You could walk through.

2866
01:54:48,731 --> 01:54:48,891
Yeah.

2867
01:54:48,891 --> 01:54:51,234
So then I will walk through this exercise.

2868
01:54:51,234 --> 01:54:51,615
Okay.

2869
01:54:51,615 --> 01:54:53,798
Basically, uh, what you see

2870
01:54:53,798 --> 01:54:56,862
here is like, uh, I created a new recipe here.

2871
01:54:56,862 --> 01:54:57,082
Okay.

2872
01:54:58,648 --> 01:55:01,050
So when you click on the new recipe,

2873
01:55:02,152 --> 01:55:05,235
what you next do is like

2874
01:55:05,235 --> 01:55:07,257
a click on this contribute button.

2875
01:55:07,257 --> 01:55:09,099
When you click on this contribute button,

2876
01:55:09,099 --> 01:55:10,440
you can then request for

2877
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,561
the open pull request.

2878
01:55:12,622 --> 01:55:14,644
So if you click on this green button,

2879
01:55:14,644 --> 01:55:16,686
which is open pull request,

2880
01:55:16,686 --> 01:55:20,811
then it will ask you to fill a few things.

2881
01:55:20,811 --> 01:55:23,033
As [name] mentioned before,

2882
01:55:23,033 --> 01:55:27,477
Basically, we need to choose where to push.

2883
01:55:27,477 --> 01:55:29,479
Here it will be your branch.

2884
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,923
It is my name and my

2885
01:55:33,923 --> 01:55:36,645
recipe book, and then here it

2886
01:55:36,645 --> 01:55:39,007
should be your new recipe.

2887
01:55:39,007 --> 01:55:42,511
Then you can add some comments here,

2888
01:55:42,511 --> 01:55:48,957
add push the new recipe, and

2889
01:55:48,957 --> 01:55:50,918
you can add some description if

2890
01:55:50,918 --> 01:55:52,820
you want, and then create pull request.

2891
01:55:54,977 --> 01:55:56,679
So once you create the

2892
01:55:56,679 --> 01:55:59,382
pull request, it starts checking.

2893
01:55:59,382 --> 01:56:01,224
And if there are no conflicts,

2894
01:56:01,224 --> 01:56:03,406
then you can basically just

2895
01:56:03,406 --> 01:56:05,268
do the merging part.

2896
01:56:05,268 --> 01:56:07,691
Okay.

2897
01:56:07,691 --> 01:56:09,793
And here you can also just

2898
01:56:09,793 --> 01:56:15,199
write a new recipe.

2899
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:16,160
Okay.

2900
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,542
And then just do a confirm.

2901
01:56:23,614 --> 01:56:27,399
And once you merge the pull

2902
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:28,940
request, if you want, you

2903
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:29,962
can delete the branch.

2904
01:56:29,962 --> 01:56:34,848
OK, or else you can leave it.

2905
01:56:34,848 --> 01:56:35,969
It's up to you.

2906
01:56:35,969 --> 01:56:37,751
And let me go quickly to

2907
01:56:37,751 --> 01:56:40,955
the code and see what are the branches created.

2908
01:56:40,955 --> 01:56:41,436
OK.

2909
01:56:42,437 --> 01:56:44,580
So you can again go to the code

2910
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:46,722
and look into these branches

2911
01:56:46,722 --> 01:56:48,544
using this fork button.

2912
01:56:48,544 --> 01:56:50,407
And then here you can see.

2913
01:56:51,908 --> 01:56:52,774
OK.

2914
01:56:52,774 --> 01:56:54,195
Yeah.

2915
01:56:54,195 --> 01:56:55,737
One thing is, even if we

2916
01:56:55,737 --> 01:56:57,379
decide to delete the branch,

2917
01:56:57,379 --> 01:56:59,901
the commits, that branch will remain.

2918
01:56:59,901 --> 01:57:01,202
It's just that point for

2919
01:57:01,202 --> 01:57:02,864
that branch disappeared.

2920
01:57:02,864 --> 01:57:04,686
All the commits would remain

2921
01:57:04,686 --> 01:57:05,407
if it is merged.

2922
01:57:06,768 --> 01:57:07,068
Okay.

2923
01:57:08,089 --> 01:57:09,631
So, yeah.

2924
01:57:09,631 --> 01:57:10,852
What is next, [name]?

2925
01:57:10,852 --> 01:57:12,334
Is there anything?

2926
01:57:12,334 --> 01:57:13,575
What we can do is, while

2927
01:57:13,575 --> 01:57:15,937
we wait a little bit, we have about, I mean,

2928
01:57:15,937 --> 01:57:17,519
like five minutes, we can

2929
01:57:17,519 --> 01:57:19,681
stay and see whether we can

2930
01:57:19,681 --> 01:57:23,453
ask the learners to try it out, the merging.

2931
01:57:23,453 --> 01:57:25,516
not necessarily go out for exercise,

2932
01:57:25,516 --> 01:57:27,639
but we can see while you

2933
01:57:27,639 --> 01:57:29,261
browse, ask them to merge and

2934
01:57:29,261 --> 01:57:31,805
ask questions if they have, or

2935
01:57:31,805 --> 01:57:33,988
if they feel any, face any difficulty.

2936
01:57:35,451 --> 01:57:37,674
Sorry, I lost you for a while.

2937
01:57:37,674 --> 01:57:38,315
Okay.

2938
01:57:38,315 --> 01:57:38,535
Yeah.

2939
01:57:38,535 --> 01:57:39,476
So I would recommend that

2940
01:57:39,476 --> 01:57:41,599
maybe the learners, the

2941
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:42,781
participants could also try to

2942
01:57:42,781 --> 01:57:44,924
merge and see where they face any issues.

2943
01:57:44,924 --> 01:57:45,906
If they face an issue, then

2944
01:57:45,906 --> 01:57:47,668
maybe you can show how to

2945
01:57:47,668 --> 01:57:49,980
solve it on the screen.

2946
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,002
Okay, fine.

2947
01:57:52,002 --> 01:57:53,204
Someone is asking, what is

2948
01:57:53,204 --> 01:57:54,986
the history behind a pull request?

2949
01:57:54,986 --> 01:57:56,387
Why not merge request instead

2950
01:57:56,387 --> 01:57:59,531
of because of direction seems makes sense.

2951
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:00,512
So this pull request,

2952
01:58:00,512 --> 01:58:02,474
merge request, there's actually a platform.

2953
01:58:02,474 --> 01:58:03,796
So those are not like

2954
01:58:03,796 --> 01:58:05,918
fundamentally Git stuff.

2955
01:58:05,918 --> 01:58:08,041
For example, it's named

2956
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,863
differently in GitLab, for example.

2957
01:58:09,863 --> 01:58:11,725
So GitHub, GitLab, they use

2958
01:58:11,725 --> 01:58:14,228
different terms sometimes.

2959
01:58:14,228 --> 01:58:15,530
But what it means is to

2960
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:18,553
integrate with the main line of work.

2961
01:58:21,537 --> 01:58:25,844
Um, so if you see a conflict, um,

2962
01:58:25,844 --> 01:58:29,550
that also, uh, like if you, um, um,

2963
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:30,912
[name], could you show that,

2964
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,256
um, uh, that picture with

2965
01:58:33,256 --> 01:58:34,298
that sunglass and hats?

2966
01:58:35,319 --> 01:58:35,600
Okay.

2967
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:38,825
And that's in the rosin, right?

2968
01:58:40,107 --> 01:58:41,269
Um, yes.

2969
01:58:41,269 --> 01:58:42,310
The.

2970
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,631
Oh, sorry.

2971
01:58:42,631 --> 01:58:43,432
Motivation.

2972
01:58:45,736 --> 01:58:47,038
Uh, maybe one before.

2973
01:58:49,718 --> 01:58:51,102
Yeah, here.

2974
01:58:51,102 --> 01:58:53,588
So here, if instead of the sunglass,

2975
01:58:53,588 --> 01:58:55,032
if you are trying a red

2976
01:58:55,032 --> 01:58:57,498
hat and a black hat, then

2977
01:58:57,498 --> 01:58:59,082
when you are combining it, it

2978
01:58:59,082 --> 01:59:01,107
might not know automatically how to combine it.

2979
01:59:02,049 --> 01:59:05,901
So then a human is needed to decide.

2980
01:59:05,901 --> 01:59:07,343
here because it's a sunglass and

2981
01:59:07,343 --> 01:59:09,566
a hat it just combined so if it is this

2982
01:59:09,566 --> 01:59:10,968
for example if two people

2983
01:59:10,968 --> 01:59:13,772
um modify the same line of

2984
01:59:13,772 --> 01:59:16,336
code then git won't know which

2985
01:59:16,336 --> 01:59:19,380
one to keep because if it takes one

2986
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,421
and discard the other there's

2987
01:59:20,421 --> 01:59:22,304
a loss of information so as

2988
01:59:22,304 --> 01:59:25,020
long as there's no loss of information

2989
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:26,542
it'll do automatically.

2990
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:27,944
But as soon as there's

2991
01:59:27,944 --> 01:59:30,607
a possibility of losing information,

2992
01:59:30,607 --> 01:59:32,710
it'll ask the intervention of a human.

2993
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:34,071
So that we call a conflict.

2994
01:59:35,533 --> 01:59:38,577
So the conflict, there's a kind

2995
01:59:38,577 --> 01:59:39,918
of a demo here as well.

2996
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,903
At the end, I think, let

2997
01:59:43,903 --> 01:59:45,786
me check in the merging part.

2998
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:51,493
If you go further down,

2999
01:59:52,294 --> 01:59:53,255
it's all in conflict.

3000
01:59:54,096 --> 01:59:55,057
in the in the in the

3001
01:59:55,057 --> 01:59:56,319
in the document that you are showing.

3002
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,748
So yeah, so in the in the yeah,

3003
02:00:01,748 --> 02:00:03,851
so in the in the in the as an example,

3004
02:00:03,851 --> 02:00:06,095
there's one example in the same lesson

3005
02:00:06,095 --> 02:00:07,016
that you are showing before

3006
02:00:07,016 --> 02:00:09,820
in the merging changes and

3007
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:11,223
contributing to the project lesson.

3008
02:00:15,069 --> 02:00:16,371
Yeah.

3009
02:00:16,371 --> 02:00:18,534
So okay, let's go there then.

3010
02:00:20,556 --> 02:00:21,517
So at the end, there's a

3011
02:00:21,517 --> 02:00:25,282
simple example for demonstrating a conflict.

3012
02:00:34,315 --> 02:00:36,097
Resolving conflicts and demonstration.

3013
02:00:36,097 --> 02:00:39,081
It's a demonstration, but I

3014
02:00:39,081 --> 02:00:41,124
don't think we have time

3015
02:00:41,124 --> 02:00:42,506
for that demonstration, but I

3016
02:00:42,506 --> 02:00:45,670
think we'll talk about it later

3017
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:48,774
on as well in the lessons when we...

3018
02:00:50,323 --> 02:00:53,626
especially when we entertain

3019
02:00:53,626 --> 02:00:55,728
pooled requests from different users.

3020
02:00:55,728 --> 02:01:00,672
So a conflict is mainly when

3021
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,893
Git want to combine two

3022
02:01:01,893 --> 02:01:04,475
things from two different, like

3023
02:01:04,475 --> 02:01:06,777
combine two different branches and

3024
02:01:06,777 --> 02:01:08,899
the file that it's trying to

3025
02:01:08,899 --> 02:01:10,941
combine has been modified on the

3026
02:01:10,941 --> 02:01:13,684
same line that by two different people.

3027
02:01:13,684 --> 02:01:18,828
So it's to avoid loss of information.

3028
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:22,662
Okay, now let's go for the

3029
02:01:22,662 --> 02:01:24,605
day two, like the preparation for the day two.

3030
02:01:25,546 --> 02:01:25,846
Okay.

3031
02:01:25,846 --> 02:01:28,209
I think, yeah, since we are

3032
02:01:28,209 --> 02:01:29,030
at the last 10 minutes.

3033
02:01:29,931 --> 02:01:31,613
Yeah, should I share my

3034
02:01:31,613 --> 02:01:32,354
screen in that case?

3035
02:01:33,255 --> 02:01:37,800
I think if you want, you can just... Yes.

3036
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,502
Yeah, I don't know.

3037
02:01:39,502 --> 02:01:41,024
I'm sharing my screen now.

3038
02:01:41,024 --> 02:01:42,266
We can show my one.

3039
02:01:49,414 --> 02:01:50,432
Sorry, it's not.

3040
02:01:50,432 --> 02:01:53,115
It will not show up correctly if, okay.

3041
02:01:53,115 --> 02:01:54,016
So now there's only one

3042
02:01:54,016 --> 02:01:58,622
person sharing and I can set it to here.

3043
02:02:00,925 --> 02:02:01,526
Yes, okay.

3044
02:02:01,526 --> 02:02:03,047
Got it showing correctly.

3045
02:02:03,047 --> 02:02:03,948
All right.

3046
02:02:03,948 --> 02:02:04,389
Yeah.

3047
02:02:04,389 --> 02:02:06,431
So while I'm talking that, Erno

3048
02:02:06,431 --> 02:02:08,314
and [name], that it's also

3049
02:02:08,314 --> 02:02:09,415
important that you give us

3050
02:02:09,415 --> 02:02:13,019
some feedback about how the day was.

3051
02:02:13,019 --> 02:02:15,002
So please do that as well.

3052
02:02:16,243 --> 02:02:17,185
And then I'll give you

3053
02:02:17,185 --> 02:02:19,207
some details about the,

3054
02:02:20,503 --> 02:02:25,348
next lesson um tomorrow we'll

3055
02:02:25,348 --> 02:02:27,730
be doing most realistic stuff

3056
02:02:27,730 --> 02:02:28,832
so today we worked on the

3057
02:02:28,832 --> 02:02:31,995
browser this is not necessarily the

3058
02:02:31,995 --> 02:02:34,598
way we work because um when

3059
02:02:34,598 --> 02:02:35,679
you have code you have to

3060
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:37,060
work on the terminal or

3061
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:39,322
on an integrated development

3062
02:02:39,322 --> 02:02:41,324
um environment like you know vs

3063
02:02:41,324 --> 02:02:43,447
code or so there are so

3064
02:02:43,447 --> 02:02:45,869
many environments for this you need

3065
02:02:45,869 --> 02:02:50,355
to um do certain things by tomorrow

3066
02:02:50,355 --> 02:02:51,436
First thing is that to

3067
02:02:51,436 --> 02:02:52,898
create a GitHub account that

3068
02:02:52,898 --> 02:02:55,582
you have already done, and then

3069
02:02:56,523 --> 02:02:59,347
you have to configure the Git a little bit.

3070
02:03:00,448 --> 02:03:01,750
Some, you know, you have to

3071
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:05,715
inform Git your name and information like that.

3072
02:03:06,597 --> 02:03:08,900
Let me go down here and

3073
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:10,762
point you to where that information is.

3074
02:03:12,504 --> 02:03:14,507
Configuring Git command line editor.

3075
02:03:15,735 --> 02:03:17,097
So now I'm going to pull

3076
02:03:17,097 --> 02:03:19,200
up a terminal like today, the

3077
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,122
first time I'm going to pull

3078
02:03:20,122 --> 02:03:23,907
this up and then I'm going to

3079
02:03:23,907 --> 02:03:29,876
show you the way it should be configured.

3080
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:32,681
So in the git terminal, so

3081
02:03:32,681 --> 02:03:34,343
you see my terminal now, maybe

3082
02:03:34,343 --> 02:03:35,445
I make the font a little

3083
02:03:35,445 --> 02:03:39,191
bit bigger and maybe make it

3084
02:03:39,191 --> 02:03:43,397
a little lighter, even lighter maybe.

3085
02:03:45,942 --> 02:03:49,567
yes the first thing you need is git

3086
02:03:49,567 --> 02:03:50,769
so you should when you type

3087
02:03:50,769 --> 02:03:54,414
git version it should print something

3088
02:03:55,355 --> 02:03:58,660
so i have 241 so any any version

3089
02:03:58,660 --> 02:03:59,541
that close by should be

3090
02:03:59,541 --> 02:04:02,105
okay the other thing you need

3091
02:04:02,105 --> 02:04:09,215
is when you type ssh version

3092
02:04:11,608 --> 02:04:13,150
that should print something but

3093
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:14,071
that's not how you type the

3094
02:04:14,071 --> 02:04:14,832
value you have to type a

3095
02:04:14,832 --> 02:04:16,875
capital V here it should

3096
02:04:16,875 --> 02:04:18,798
print something not like command

3097
02:04:18,798 --> 02:04:23,244
not found then the next command

3098
02:04:23,244 --> 02:04:25,126
is to see whether you can

3099
02:04:25,126 --> 02:04:32,396
connect to GitHub GitHub.com so

3100
02:04:32,396 --> 02:04:34,359
the first one is to check the version of git

3101
02:04:35,875 --> 02:04:38,919
Second one is to SSH, whether you have SSH.

3102
02:04:38,919 --> 02:04:40,040
Normally you have it on

3103
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:42,182
Windows, you have it in the

3104
02:04:42,182 --> 02:04:43,804
PowerShell and even the terminal you have it.

3105
02:04:44,805 --> 02:04:47,609
And then what you do is with

3106
02:04:47,609 --> 02:04:48,830
a capital T to see whether

3107
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:51,393
you can connect to github.com.

3108
02:04:51,393 --> 02:04:53,015
The first time when you issue

3109
02:04:53,015 --> 02:04:54,317
that command, it will ask, it

3110
02:04:54,317 --> 02:04:55,958
will tell you that you are

3111
02:04:55,958 --> 02:04:57,881
going to connect to something that

3112
02:04:57,881 --> 02:04:59,763
you are never connected before.

3113
02:04:59,763 --> 02:05:00,684
Do you trust that?

3114
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:02,652
So if you had typed

3115
02:05:02,652 --> 02:05:05,476
the address correctly, github.com,

3116
02:05:05,476 --> 02:05:06,358
then you should trust that.

3117
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,703
And you could also cross-check

3118
02:05:09,703 --> 02:05:11,386
this hash with GitHub if you want.

3119
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:15,272
Then it says permission denied.

3120
02:05:15,272 --> 02:05:16,874
So this is the most likely

3121
02:05:16,874 --> 02:05:19,258
case that you will get if you

3122
02:05:19,258 --> 02:05:21,262
have not used Git before.

3123
02:05:22,443 --> 02:05:23,826
Because I have been using Git

3124
02:05:24,687 --> 02:05:26,750
and I have configured it, if I

3125
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:27,752
use it on my laptop,

3126
02:05:31,275 --> 02:05:35,781
github.com sorry not git ssh

3127
02:05:39,466 --> 02:05:44,413
ssh it would return that okay

3128
02:05:45,655 --> 02:05:51,263
still public is not accepted so when you

3129
02:05:51,263 --> 02:05:55,529
when you get this message

3130
02:05:55,529 --> 02:05:57,131
the thing you should do is

3131
02:05:57,131 --> 02:06:00,776
mentioned here you have to go and set up

3132
02:06:02,005 --> 02:06:04,849
SSH key pair.

3133
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:07,873
So what this basically do

3134
02:06:07,873 --> 02:06:11,878
is that there's some credentials

3135
02:06:11,878 --> 02:06:15,483
in your computer that you

3136
02:06:15,483 --> 02:06:16,544
create some credentials, we

3137
02:06:16,544 --> 02:06:17,285
call the certificate.

3138
02:06:18,186 --> 02:06:20,970
And you place that in GitHub.

3139
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:23,013
And whenever you reach GitHub,

3140
02:06:23,013 --> 02:06:24,415
GitHub knows that it is you.

3141
02:06:25,336 --> 02:06:26,658
So let me try with this

3142
02:06:26,658 --> 02:06:28,440
command again with the git

3143
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:29,882
task username, because it went

3144
02:06:29,882 --> 02:06:30,763
with my username.

3145
02:06:32,228 --> 02:06:38,174
github.com task my uh need

3146
02:06:38,174 --> 02:06:43,539
to unlock then if you if

3147
02:06:43,539 --> 02:06:44,980
you had configured it you had to

3148
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:46,541
be you get this message as

3149
02:06:46,541 --> 02:06:48,403
successful i'll just do it again

3150
02:06:48,403 --> 02:06:49,524
in my virtual machine which

3151
02:06:49,524 --> 02:06:50,826
is not configured to get

3152
02:06:50,826 --> 02:06:56,851
the correct message what's this

3153
02:06:58,393 --> 02:07:00,935
then it should say public key it says denied

3154
02:07:02,502 --> 02:07:05,466
So by tomorrow, you should be

3155
02:07:05,466 --> 02:07:09,471
able to issue this command and be

3156
02:07:09,471 --> 02:07:11,173
able to get a successful authentication.

3157
02:07:12,334 --> 02:07:15,177
How to do that is explained here.

3158
02:07:18,542 --> 02:07:19,763
So installation instructions,

3159
02:07:19,763 --> 02:07:21,325
how to create a key and

3160
02:07:21,325 --> 02:07:23,628
what that is, what this means.

3161
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:27,392
I hope that you could do

3162
02:07:27,392 --> 02:07:30,177
this today and make sure that

3163
02:07:30,177 --> 02:07:32,480
you are ready for tomorrow's

3164
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:36,085
workshop um did that explain him

3165
02:07:36,085 --> 02:07:37,187
or should i explain a little

3166
02:07:37,187 --> 02:07:39,610
bit more no that is good

3167
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,414
actually uh there will be i'm

3168
02:07:42,414 --> 02:07:43,936
just looking at the note

3169
02:07:43,936 --> 02:07:46,580
uh notebook basically there is

3170
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:48,382
an installation help available on

3171
02:07:48,382 --> 02:07:51,206
zoom zoom one hour before

3172
02:07:51,206 --> 02:07:54,050
for oslo so basically more

3173
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:56,934
details will be followed like uh

3174
02:07:56,934 --> 02:07:57,876
and you will receive any

3175
02:07:57,876 --> 02:07:58,817
email regarding this so

3176
02:08:00,062 --> 02:08:02,385
Good.

3177
02:08:02,385 --> 02:08:05,268
So, will the learners will

3178
02:08:05,268 --> 02:08:06,529
get an email about this?

3179
02:08:10,453 --> 02:08:12,656
I guess, yeah.

3180
02:08:12,656 --> 02:08:13,457
We'll try to.

3181
02:08:14,257 --> 02:08:14,878
Try to, yes.

3182
02:08:14,878 --> 02:08:16,240
So, basically, what you try to

3183
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:21,205
do is to follow the instructions here.

3184
02:08:21,205 --> 02:08:22,907
So, when you issue this

3185
02:08:22,907 --> 02:08:25,630
command, ssh dash capital T

3186
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:29,394
GitHub, git at github.com, it should

3187
02:08:31,045 --> 02:08:32,667
get you into a place where

3188
02:08:32,667 --> 02:08:34,971
it says it was successful.

3189
02:08:34,971 --> 02:08:35,371
Yeah.

3190
02:08:35,371 --> 02:08:37,094
Shall we take the notebook then?

3191
02:08:37,094 --> 02:08:39,297
Like the final questions?

3192
02:08:39,297 --> 02:08:39,737
Yes.

3193
02:08:39,737 --> 02:08:41,199
So we'll go for the final questions.

3194
02:08:45,485 --> 02:08:46,587
Can you comment on your

3195
02:08:46,587 --> 02:08:48,830
GitHub desktop versus VS Code command?

3196
02:08:49,751 --> 02:08:50,072
Yeah.

3197
02:08:50,072 --> 02:08:53,036
So, so the,

3198
02:08:57,268 --> 02:08:59,791
mean if you can go for

3199
02:08:59,791 --> 02:09:02,014
the command line vs code or the terminal

3200
02:09:02,014 --> 02:09:04,036
or any other command line

3201
02:09:05,097 --> 02:09:08,582
you get more transparent outputs

3202
02:09:08,582 --> 02:09:11,645
when you do git and you can do more steps

3203
02:09:11,645 --> 02:09:12,967
for example when you when you

3204
02:09:12,967 --> 02:09:14,128
want to make a commit you

3205
02:09:14,128 --> 02:09:16,171
could commit like git add to

3206
02:09:16,171 --> 02:09:18,073
collect all the relevant commits

3207
02:09:18,073 --> 02:09:20,860
into one place and then git push

3208
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:22,382
Git commit.

3209
02:09:22,382 --> 02:09:26,088
But in the GitHub interface,

3210
02:09:26,088 --> 02:09:27,771
most things are not that transparent.

3211
02:09:31,617 --> 02:09:34,662
So the close commit, so this is, I mean,

3212
02:09:34,662 --> 02:09:37,927
when you have merge request and then

3213
02:09:37,927 --> 02:09:39,810
when you say close the

3214
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:41,072
merge request without merging,

3215
02:09:41,072 --> 02:09:42,763
which means that

3216
02:09:42,763 --> 02:09:44,866
that the changes in that

3217
02:09:44,866 --> 02:09:47,090
branch would not be merged,

3218
02:09:47,090 --> 02:09:48,031
which not be integrated.

3219
02:09:48,031 --> 02:09:49,674
It will remain in the branch.

3220
02:09:49,674 --> 02:09:51,536
But if that branch is deleted, then

3221
02:09:51,536 --> 02:09:52,638
that commit, that change

3222
02:09:52,638 --> 02:09:54,241
is disappeared, that gone forever.

3223
02:09:55,082 --> 02:09:57,285
But after it merged without

3224
02:09:57,285 --> 02:09:59,388
closing, if you delete it, it will not go away.

3225
02:10:01,111 --> 02:10:01,351
Okay.

3226
02:10:03,875 --> 02:10:04,096
Yeah.

3227
02:10:04,096 --> 02:10:06,339
So this conflict, we didn't go

3228
02:10:06,339 --> 02:10:07,461
through too much today about

3229
02:10:07,461 --> 02:10:08,923
the conflict because of the

3230
02:10:09,730 --> 02:10:11,512
the complexity of like, we want

3231
02:10:11,512 --> 02:10:13,073
to make it very least complex today.

3232
02:10:14,815 --> 02:10:15,836
Um, but that is some

3233
02:10:15,836 --> 02:10:17,657
natural thing that you'll encounter.

3234
02:10:17,657 --> 02:10:19,179
If two people modify the same

3235
02:10:19,179 --> 02:10:21,301
line of a file, for example,

3236
02:10:21,301 --> 02:10:23,403
or, uh, you modify the same line

3237
02:10:23,403 --> 02:10:25,505
of a file in different branches,

3238
02:10:25,505 --> 02:10:27,767
Git would ask your help to select what to keep.

3239
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:31,570
Yeah.

3240
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:32,911
Anything else, [name], that you

3241
02:10:32,911 --> 02:10:34,132
need to mention before we close?

3242
02:10:34,973 --> 02:10:35,093
Yeah.

3243
02:10:35,093 --> 02:10:36,935
Should we move to the, um,

3244
02:10:38,974 --> 02:10:40,476
to the close, basically.

3245
02:10:40,476 --> 02:10:45,342
So yeah, it's a couple of

3246
02:10:45,342 --> 02:10:46,704
things in the end of the notes.

3247
02:10:46,704 --> 02:10:48,366
The most important thing is

3248
02:10:48,366 --> 02:10:49,848
the feedback section.

3249
02:10:49,848 --> 02:10:51,310
So yeah, please do give us

3250
02:10:51,310 --> 02:10:52,992
feedback for how this day went.

3251
02:10:54,394 --> 02:10:55,836
There's some standard questions

3252
02:10:55,836 --> 02:10:56,657
we always ask.

3253
02:10:57,798 --> 02:11:00,882
If it was too fast, too slow, just right.

3254
02:11:01,763 --> 02:11:03,165
And we'll try to adjust.

3255
02:11:04,247 --> 02:11:05,518
And...

3256
02:11:05,518 --> 02:11:07,821
Well, let's take a look at

3257
02:11:07,821 --> 02:11:08,742
those in a moment.

3258
02:11:08,742 --> 02:11:10,625
But first, news.

3259
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:12,508
So if you scroll a little bit up,

3260
02:11:12,508 --> 02:11:14,971
there's an info section, a

3261
02:11:14,971 --> 02:11:17,375
blue box with news on it.

3262
02:11:17,375 --> 02:11:18,096
Scroll a little bit up.

3263
02:11:19,698 --> 02:11:21,400
I could, of course, also move

3264
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:24,124
to the notes that I have

3265
02:11:24,124 --> 02:11:26,467
on the broadcaster computer.

3266
02:11:26,467 --> 02:11:27,449
But okay.

3267
02:11:27,449 --> 02:11:30,333
So yeah, there were basics of Git today.

3268
02:11:30,333 --> 02:11:32,375
We covered GitHub, mostly using

3269
02:11:32,375 --> 02:11:33,970
GitHub user interface.

3270
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:37,373
tomorrow we'll move to your local computer.

3271
02:11:37,373 --> 02:11:41,637
So if today was either like

3272
02:11:41,637 --> 02:11:47,243
too much GitHub or too abstract or too easy,

3273
02:11:48,884 --> 02:11:50,746
don't worry, tomorrow you'll do

3274
02:11:50,746 --> 02:11:52,768
more work on your own computer.

3275
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:55,211
But it should not be

3276
02:11:55,211 --> 02:11:56,412
that much more complicated.

3277
02:11:56,412 --> 02:11:57,433
So we're kind of doing these

3278
02:11:57,433 --> 02:12:00,355
steps also to prepare so that

3279
02:12:00,355 --> 02:12:03,788
a lot of the concepts are familiar tomorrow.

3280
02:12:03,788 --> 02:12:07,133
But yeah, so tomorrow we'll

3281
02:12:07,133 --> 02:12:10,057
move on more working on your own computer.

3282
02:12:10,057 --> 02:12:11,158
And that also does mean

3283
02:12:11,158 --> 02:12:14,523
either the terminal or VS Code or similar.

3284
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:18,007
So if you haven't already,

3285
02:12:18,007 --> 02:12:19,609
please check the installation instructions.

3286
02:12:20,751 --> 02:12:22,674
Okay, so it really should

3287
02:12:22,674 --> 02:12:24,616
be exciting tomorrow because it

3288
02:12:24,616 --> 02:12:27,300
will then directly apply to

3289
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:30,644
your current work, to your

3290
02:12:30,644 --> 02:12:33,775
coding and paper writing and so on.

3291
02:12:33,775 --> 02:12:34,596
on your own computer.

3292
02:12:36,258 --> 02:12:38,360
Okay, if you have issues,

3293
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,261
yeah, there will be already

3294
02:12:39,261 --> 02:12:42,485
mentioned the support, zoom

3295
02:12:42,485 --> 02:12:44,487
or installation help.

3296
02:12:44,487 --> 02:12:47,430
Another good thing to know is

3297
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:48,712
that Twitch will store this

3298
02:12:48,712 --> 02:12:50,834
video for seven days.

3299
02:12:50,834 --> 02:12:52,376
So you can come back and

3300
02:12:52,376 --> 02:12:56,080
take a look at well, any part

3301
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:58,282
that you felt like it went too fast.

3302
02:12:59,223 --> 02:13:01,500
Anything that was

3303
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:03,262
complicated, you can try to

3304
02:13:03,262 --> 02:13:05,225
do the exercises again, when

3305
02:13:05,225 --> 02:13:07,347
maybe GitHub has less load and

3306
02:13:07,347 --> 02:13:08,829
some of the or some of the

3307
02:13:08,829 --> 02:13:10,070
other issues might be resolved.

3308
02:13:11,052 --> 02:13:14,616
And yeah, then it will be on YouTube.

3309
02:13:14,616 --> 02:13:15,637
So all of our old

3310
02:13:15,637 --> 02:13:18,741
workshops, these online workshops

3311
02:13:18,741 --> 02:13:19,722
that are streamed, they will

3312
02:13:19,722 --> 02:13:22,225
also be okay, they are already also on YouTube.

3313
02:13:22,225 --> 02:13:25,509
So you can go see the same things

3314
02:13:25,509 --> 02:13:26,590
or similar things explained

3315
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:28,773
by different people in different ways.

3316
02:13:28,773 --> 02:13:31,639
If so, hopefully, that's helpful.

3317
02:13:31,639 --> 02:13:34,883
Um, and then, yeah, so I

3318
02:13:34,883 --> 02:13:36,185
mentioned to do tomorrow, we'll

3319
02:13:36,185 --> 02:13:37,566
move to your own computer and

3320
02:13:37,566 --> 02:13:38,828
on day three, then we'll

3321
02:13:38,828 --> 02:13:41,351
move more to collaborating with people.

3322
02:13:41,351 --> 02:13:43,013
So sharing the code and working

3323
02:13:43,013 --> 02:13:46,297
on the same project and, uh,

3324
02:13:46,297 --> 02:13:48,439
also we'll see more conflicts

3325
02:13:48,439 --> 02:13:49,761
and resolve conflicts.

3326
02:13:50,702 --> 02:13:53,005
So, um, that should be interesting.

3327
02:13:55,047 --> 02:13:55,588
Okay.

3328
02:13:55,588 --> 02:13:58,912
Uh, let's take a look at the, um,

3329
02:14:00,715 --> 02:14:01,837
the feedback a bit more.

3330
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:07,365
There are a lot of votes on write speed,

3331
02:14:07,365 --> 02:14:08,466
a few votes on too

3332
02:14:08,466 --> 02:14:10,429
slow, too fast sometimes,

3333
02:14:12,272 --> 02:14:14,775
which means essentially we need

3334
02:14:14,775 --> 02:14:15,416
to pay attention.

3335
02:14:17,499 --> 02:14:19,062
But at least it's an average good.

3336
02:14:21,085 --> 02:14:23,268
Some on write level, some on too basic.

3337
02:14:24,610 --> 02:14:26,753
Tomorrow will be a bit more advanced.

3338
02:14:26,753 --> 02:14:28,194
So if you're starting with

3339
02:14:28,194 --> 02:14:30,157
already knowing some Git, then

3340
02:14:30,157 --> 02:14:34,081
maybe today was not that much

3341
02:14:34,081 --> 02:14:37,364
new stuff, but tomorrow should be more.

3342
02:14:39,426 --> 02:14:40,507
So, but yeah, people are

3343
02:14:40,507 --> 02:14:43,250
saying they will use what they learned today,

3344
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:44,812
which is really good to hear,

3345
02:14:45,953 --> 02:14:48,075
and that they would recommend for others.

3346
02:14:48,075 --> 02:14:48,996
So that's nice.

3347
02:14:48,996 --> 02:14:50,818
So let's see what specific,

3348
02:14:50,818 --> 02:14:55,663
what catches your eye, [name], [name].

3349
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:00,333
somebody accidentally asked to

3350
02:15:00,333 --> 02:15:02,215
brand merge their branch with mine.

3351
02:15:02,215 --> 02:15:03,417
So I think I made a new friend.

3352
02:15:03,417 --> 02:15:04,738
That's nice to hear.

3353
02:15:04,738 --> 02:15:07,602
Yeah.

3354
02:15:07,602 --> 02:15:08,603
And yeah, to collaborate

3355
02:15:08,603 --> 02:15:09,765
document, we always like that.

3356
02:15:10,746 --> 02:15:14,851
Okay, somebody is calling

3357
02:15:14,851 --> 02:15:16,053
the stream professional, which is

3358
02:15:16,053 --> 02:15:17,615
nice for me to hear because I

3359
02:15:17,615 --> 02:15:18,536
made a lot of mistakes.

3360
02:15:19,898 --> 02:15:21,920
But it wasn't that bad.

3361
02:15:23,042 --> 02:15:27,067
Yeah, the font size was small for a

3362
02:15:28,127 --> 02:15:30,371
for some period of time,

3363
02:15:30,371 --> 02:15:33,617
and we didn't communicate either

3364
02:15:33,617 --> 02:15:34,999
clearly enough or loudly enough

3365
02:15:36,001 --> 02:15:36,823
when it happened.

3366
02:15:36,823 --> 02:15:38,806
So yeah, next time, I

3367
02:15:38,806 --> 02:15:43,234
guess I'll escalate to speaking up and see.

3368
02:15:43,234 --> 02:15:45,057
So because it is like you concentrate

3369
02:15:45,057 --> 02:15:46,139
when I know when I've

3370
02:15:46,139 --> 02:15:47,422
been at the instructor, you

3371
02:15:47,422 --> 02:15:49,265
really, you focus on what

3372
02:15:49,265 --> 02:15:50,747
you're doing, and then you don't

3373
02:15:50,747 --> 02:15:52,290
look at the chat and so on.

3374
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:53,102
So I

3375
02:15:53,102 --> 02:15:54,604
It was essentially on me,

3376
02:15:54,604 --> 02:15:57,167
I should have spoken up more quickly.

3377
02:15:59,991 --> 02:16:02,895
But yeah, so that's important feedback.

3378
02:16:09,003 --> 02:16:09,403
Okay.

3379
02:16:12,027 --> 02:16:14,029
I think we're done for the end.

3380
02:16:14,029 --> 02:16:17,334
Thank you all the assistance

3381
02:16:17,334 --> 02:16:18,435
from our colleagues to answer

3382
02:16:18,435 --> 02:16:19,056
all the questions.

3383
02:16:19,056 --> 02:16:20,578
It was very well answered as well.

3384
02:16:22,515 --> 02:16:24,618
And thank you, [name], and thank you,

3385
02:16:24,618 --> 02:16:26,660
[name], [name], and everybody

3386
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:28,923
else, and also the helpers.

3387
02:16:28,923 --> 02:16:30,044
And we'll see you tomorrow.

3388
02:16:30,044 --> 02:16:31,666
I hope you'll come back

3389
02:16:31,666 --> 02:16:36,632
tomorrow to learn more.

3390
02:16:36,632 --> 02:16:38,054
Yeah, tomorrow will be really

3391
02:16:38,054 --> 02:16:41,277
more, even more hands-on.

3392
02:16:41,277 --> 02:16:43,220
It will look more familiar

3393
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:45,783
compared to what your normal,

3394
02:16:45,783 --> 02:16:47,545
at least, coding workflow is.

3395
02:16:47,545 --> 02:16:49,367
So it should be exciting.

3396
02:16:51,979 --> 02:16:52,920
Thank you all.

3397
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:54,562
But I do write more feedback

3398
02:16:54,562 --> 02:16:58,507
in that we will read everything right there.

3399
02:16:59,949 --> 02:17:01,450
This is not the end of the workshop.

3400
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:02,712
And in any case, we're

3401
02:17:02,712 --> 02:17:05,575
interested to know what you have to say.

3402
02:17:07,277 --> 02:17:12,964
Please continue writing in the feedback.

3403
02:17:12,964 --> 02:17:13,325
Okay, then.

3404
02:17:14,186 --> 02:17:14,566
Bye-bye.

3405
02:17:16,168 --> 02:17:16,809
All right.

3406
02:17:16,809 --> 02:17:17,670
Bye.

3407
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:19,472
See you tomorrow, everyone.
