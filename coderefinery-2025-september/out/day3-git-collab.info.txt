3.2 Git collaborative - CodeRefinery 2025 Sep

Today, we expand from using git by yourself to using it in a team.  We use Github, centralized workflows, forking on Github, pull requests, code review, commenting on pull requests, practical advice on using Git and version control in real projects, contributing to other projects, and more.  This really puts the previous two days together and lets you know how things work in bigger projects.
