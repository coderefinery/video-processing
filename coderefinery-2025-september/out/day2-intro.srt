00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:02,834
Hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:04,235
day two of the Code

3
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:07,018
Refinery workshop, September-October 2025.

4
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:09,260
I'm [name] here, your

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,622
workshop organizer for this time

6
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:12,483
along with [name].

7
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,246
And with me today we

8
00:00:16,246 --> 00:00:18,968
have [name] from CSC

9
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:21,491
Finland and [name] also

10
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:22,612
from Aalto University Finland.

11
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:26,155
And [name] also from

12
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:30,739
our team is the broadcaster for today.

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,565
so a bit of reminder if

14
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:36,287
you were not with us yesterday

15
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,091
it's totally fine you can

16
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,275
still understand everything and

17
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,657
do everything that will be done today

18
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:46,783
and if you want to re-watch

19
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:49,767
what was done yesterday on twitch

20
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,570
tv on the same link that

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,172
you watch in this stream you

22
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:56,497
can also watch yesterday's videos

23
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,600
later for example if you want to catch up

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,063
but in general today you

25
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:04,088
are good to understand what's been doing

26
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:05,530
and also be able to do

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,372
the exercises along with the

28
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:10,677
instructors in the workshop web page

29
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:11,758
that I'm showing right now

30
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,262
you find the materials for today and

31
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:16,264
so now I'm scrolling down to

32
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:20,210
day two and today we will

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,012
continue with this git version

34
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:24,736
control and I'm gonna briefly give

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,278
you a mini intro

36
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:30,522
so yesterday we learned about

37
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:32,604
all this terminology around

38
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:35,408
git version control so you

39
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:38,051
heard all these terms like forking

40
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,915
and pull requests and commits

41
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,579
and it's okay if not

42
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,141
everything is fully clear because

43
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:46,422
these terms will be repeated

44
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,465
today and also tomorrow

45
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,808
But the goal, what was important is

46
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,631
that you understood the motivation,

47
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:53,933
why it is so important to

48
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,495
work with virtual control as a

49
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,418
time machine to go back in

50
00:01:57,418 --> 00:02:00,402
time in a previous version of

51
00:02:00,402 --> 00:02:04,988
your code or whatever project

52
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:07,011
that you are version controlling.

53
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,118
today for day two we'll move

54
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,324
to local work so if yesterday

55
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:15,712
we were using this github.com

56
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,837
web browser web server meaning

57
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,601
that the files were stored

58
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:22,127
somewhere in the cloud in

59
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,490
actually microsoft cloud because

60
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,455
github is microsoft today

61
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:28,299
now it's good that we have github.com

62
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,202
as a remote repository but

63
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:33,147
it's also good to work locally so

64
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:34,709
and this is what will happen today

65
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,752
so the files instead of

66
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:38,235
being just in github.com will

67
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:40,218
come to your computer you will

68
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,421
be able to edit them do changes and

69
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,583
when you're happy you can push

70
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,127
them back to the cloud

71
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:50,233
github.com servers or you know i

72
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,194
don't want to spoil the fun

73
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:53,518
you will see today what we will do

74
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:54,840
In the links that you have

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,162
received in your email there is

76
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:59,446
also this notes document and

77
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,429
just a reminder although I

78
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:03,933
was just chatting about it when

79
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,056
you visit this notes document

80
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,700
it looks like this and you

81
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,801
can use this to basically

82
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:11,644
interactively ask questions to

83
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:14,087
our instructors and our helpers

84
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:15,629
by clicking in the very top

85
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,352
there is a pencil which will

86
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,395
switch the notes from this view

87
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:23,100
mode to this editor mode

88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,743
and it's basically a simple text editor

89
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:27,946
so that many hundreds of people

90
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,268
can edit at the same time.

91
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,030
I think it's like a Google Doc

92
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,112
but a bit more reliable

93
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,133
because Google Doc has

94
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,696
limitations of simultaneous editing

95
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:36,637
and also simplified.

96
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:40,042
I can already see some questions there

97
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:43,566
and our helpers are already answering

98
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,908
so keep the questions coming

99
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,471
and I don't want to steal

100
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,455
any other precious time to our

101
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:54,202
I believe now it's a good

102
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:56,747
moment to switch to [name]'s screen.

103
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:57,469
I guess you're going to be

104
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,012
the first one, right, [name]?

105
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,534
Yes, I'm going to share.

106
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,017
Excellent.

107
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,019
I'm sharing [name]'s screen.

108
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:05,344
All right.

109
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:05,805
Right.

110
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:08,129
So the floor is yours.

111
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,854
I will move out from the

112
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:13,239
scene and have a great workshop, everyone.
