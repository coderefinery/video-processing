1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,128
the nine o'clock and so i think we can start

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,572
Hello everyone and welcome to

3
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,794
yet another Code Refinery

4
00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:08,199
workshop, September-October 2025.

5
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,745
We have a format that

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,007
is slightly different when it

7
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:14,210
comes to the schedule compared

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,434
to previous workshops, so if this

9
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,157
is not the first Code Refinery workshop

10
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:19,178
that you follow, you will

11
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:20,721
find some interesting changes,

12
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,805
more exercises basically.

13
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,427
what I'm showing right now

14
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:27,211
on the twitch.tv stream is

15
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,295
the main workshop web page which

16
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:32,599
is our kind of communication channel

17
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,700
so that here you can

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,402
follow the schedule you get all

19
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,545
the links to the materials and

20
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,268
you will also get access to

21
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:43,634
the questions and answer document

22
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:45,957
that we will soon introduce

23
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,142
so right now we are at

24
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:50,547
day one i'm scrolling down to day one

25
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:54,857
and i'm gonna talk about this welcome

26
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:56,561
and introduction to the workshop

27
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:57,904
so when i click the link

28
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,989
that is there it will actually

29
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,156
go to the presentation material

30
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:04,098
that we will use

31
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,681
so we will not use

32
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:09,147
any powerpoints here they're all materials

33
00:01:09,147 --> 00:01:12,332
and they're all hosted in github

34
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:13,234
so that if you find a

35
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,079
typo you will learn how to

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,963
submit an amendment all right but

37
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:19,725
we are glad that you are

38
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:23,531
here briefly about code refinery

39
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,935
so code refinery is an ordi

40
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:27,598
project focused on teaching

41
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,782
scientific computing tools

42
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:31,364
But Code Refinery is especially

43
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:32,686
a large community of

44
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:35,770
research software engineers, researchers

45
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,073
who need to work with computers

46
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,655
and code and data and

47
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:42,119
in general enthusiasts about

48
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,942
research software and anything that

49
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:45,824
is related to that.

50
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,267
But Code Refinery is also

51
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:49,829
this workshop where we are.

52
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,833
here right now and lots of lessons

53
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,718
and open learning materials that

54
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,103
some of them are covered in this workshop

55
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,565
but we also have other

56
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,847
learning materials that go beyond

57
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:03,289
for more advanced topic

58
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,253
there's many founders and

59
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:07,876
organizations that are involved

60
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,438
in code refinery

61
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:11,500
The main funder is

62
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,503
the Nordic E-Infrastructure Collaboration

63
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:15,045
and the partners are

64
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,428
Aalto University, where I'm from,

65
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,551
CSC, IT Centre for Science, also in Finland.

66
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,614
Then we have from Denmark the Centre

67
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:23,875
for Humanities Computing and

68
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,838
the Danish E-Infrastructure Cooperation.

69
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,366
Sweden is there with the EuroCC, ENCCS

70
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,468
and also the National

71
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:36,691
Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing.

72
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,754
And then we have Norway

73
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:40,417
with the University of Oslo, where

74
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,443
one of our first instructors is from.

75
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:45,845
And then RIS Sigma 2

76
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,368
and University of Iceland, where

77
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,693
our second instructor of the day is also from.

78
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:52,095
So I'm already going to say hi.

79
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,761
You might see their faces here to [name].

80
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:56,803
Hi, hello.

81
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:57,243
Good morning.

82
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,525
Yeah, hi.

83
00:02:58,525 --> 00:02:59,226
Good morning.

84
00:02:59,226 --> 00:02:59,894
Good morning.

85
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,940
I will introduce you properly, don't worry.

86
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,166
So with all your expertise and titles.

87
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:07,275
But briefly to motivate a little bit,

88
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:09,882
there's this nice image by

89
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:12,730
[name] that kind of tries

90
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,896
to give you the

91
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,920
what are the six useful steps

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,982
or helpful steps for

93
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,187
making reproducible research.

94
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:21,169
I'm not now going to

95
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,011
start talking about

96
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,255
reproducibility, reproducibility crisis

97
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,698
because I don't want to spoil the fun.

98
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,081
That is for next week and

99
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,023
you will hear all about

100
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:30,488
reproducibility issues in science.

101
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:33,655
But in general, all the bits

102
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,677
that you will learn throughout

103
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:37,022
the workshop are related to what you see here.

104
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:38,986
So getting your project folders

105
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,011
and files in order, making sure

106
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:41,813
that you can travel in

107
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:44,058
time, specifically that you can

108
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,461
travel back in time.

109
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,427
Travel in the future, it's still not there.

110
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:52,552
and in general so make your research

111
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:55,716
that is transparent in a

112
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,899
way that other people can look

113
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,821
at your code maybe look at your data

114
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,084
if possible and look at

115
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:04,907
your documentation so that you

116
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,130
are able to open your software

117
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,955
or open your data and follow the best practices

118
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,078
Sometimes we don't really like

119
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,740
the term best practices.

120
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,902
It's much more inclusive to

121
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,524
say good enough practices,

122
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,686
because sometimes the good enough

123
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:22,491
practices is truly what really matters.

124
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,175
So how does this workshop works?

125
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,718
Well, the format, as you

126
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:29,502
are seeing, it happens on Twitch TV.

127
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:32,446
And the reason is, well,

128
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,647
you know, most likely you've been

129
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,430
to some Zoom teaching with

130
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,672
hundreds of people there.

131
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:37,533
It's not very...

132
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:42,158
It can be stressful to

133
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:45,482
keep people microphone off and so on.

134
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,605
Here it's more like a TV show.

135
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:50,007
We are here in a small studio

136
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,870
and we are broadcasting to

137
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,652
anyone in the planet who wants

138
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:56,134
to hear about reproducible research.

139
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,859
And by doing this also, it's

140
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:02,422
easier to take care of the recordings,

141
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:03,303
that the recordings will

142
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,225
be immediately available on Twitch TV.

143
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:07,831
And later, after we basically

144
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,576
cut them and subtitle them, they

145
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,618
will be also on YouTube.

146
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,365
The attendance is kind of

147
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:14,788
choose your own adventure.

148
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,392
There are the first part,

149
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:17,535
which is happened this week.

150
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,279
It's all about version control

151
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,066
and Git with GitHub.

152
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,050
but then after that we

153
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,793
have different episodes happening

154
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,941
multiple weeks and come join the topics

155
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,363
that you find more useful

156
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,287
could it be reproducible research

157
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,431
could it be software licenses

158
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,735
could it be whatever you need

159
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,238
or follow them all we

160
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,221
don't really track attendance and

161
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,364
you can watch them live or

162
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:43,666
you can watch them later

163
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,690
materials are always available

164
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,214
they are linked in the workshop schedule

165
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,698
as I showed earlier and when

166
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,722
it comes to the actual schedule

167
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:55,487
we try to have at least a

168
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,650
10 minutes break every hour and

169
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,853
for this first part in the

170
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,035
first week we will have a one

171
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,958
hour break in the middle

172
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,203
so in when it comes to time zones

173
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:06,184
because we try to fit

174
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:07,867
multiple time zones this will

175
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,010
be a convenient break for maybe

176
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,534
people in UK and Iceland and

177
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:15,539
for the Oslo and Finland it would

178
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,263
be more like a afternoon coffee break

179
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,084
then i briefly mentioned

180
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:24,169
about this collaborative notes document

181
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,552
that i was showing earlier and

182
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,654
the idea of the collaborative

183
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,037
notes document is that it's

184
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,940
somewhat like a google docs

185
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,404
so that everyone can edit at the same time

186
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,126
and this is much more

187
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:39,051
convenient than using a chat

188
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,793
for example the zoom chat that

189
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:41,935
i was mentioning earlier

190
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,537
because here the questions

191
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,860
are basically forming a nice

192
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,203
documented set of questions and answers.

193
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:50,985
What is really interesting

194
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:52,446
that sometimes it's not just

195
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,328
the experts or the helpers that

196
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:55,129
are going to answer.

197
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,951
Sometimes you might know the answer.

198
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:58,833
You might have experienced the same bug,

199
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,174
the same issue with some

200
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:02,016
operating system and you can

201
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:02,977
share your experience.

202
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,059
So it's truly a

203
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,022
collaborative document where we can

204
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,104
all edit at the same time.

205
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:10,848
To edit the document, if you

206
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,932
open the page that you received

207
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,057
in your email, there is a

208
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:18,544
pencil in the top right corner.

209
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:19,346
So if you click on the

210
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:22,292
pencil, the view mode will change

211
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,817
from view to edit.

212
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,561
So I will briefly show it.

213
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,603
Now I have another window

214
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,966
here with the notes document.

215
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,210
I scroll up I see this

216
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,112
pencil I click the pencil and

217
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:36,535
now I'm in this edit mode and

218
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:37,737
I can see here there's

219
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,520
already 93 people watching this

220
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,084
page maybe editing this page and

221
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,645
many of you everything here

222
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,588
where you're from is it sunny

223
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,390
is it not sunny it's a

224
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,355
nice data set of locations and weather

225
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,559
and this is how we

226
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,804
run sometimes polls where basically

227
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,588
you can add in this case an

228
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:04,472
O to say you know if you wished to get them

229
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,515
and here you can already

230
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:08,878
start asking questions and you see

231
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:10,340
we use with this indentation

232
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,005
we have nice colors and different questions

233
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:14,866
Maybe the only thing that

234
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,348
it's important that you always write

235
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:18,251
on top of the last line so

236
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:20,674
that it's easier to know when is

237
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,677
the end of the document.

238
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:23,578
And if you feel that

239
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:24,700
the document is getting very

240
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,965
slow, then it's good to, you

241
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,348
know, we have a good server

242
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:31,930
that hosts this document.

243
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,472
But sometimes if I would say

244
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,534
if the number goes above

245
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:37,578
150 simultaneous edits, it starts

246
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:38,359
to get difficult.

247
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,501
So then it's good to click

248
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:41,123
on this eye icon.

249
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:44,868
in the very top part of

250
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,870
the screen and so that it goes

251
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,734
back to this view mode.

252
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,338
All right, back to the introduction.

253
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:57,624
Try to please don't put

254
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:01,048
personal data or passwords into

255
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:02,831
this share not documents.

256
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:03,451
At the end of the day,

257
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,334
we will archive it so that

258
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,916
after the whole workshop, we have

259
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,300
a nice set of question.

260
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,608
very briefly about the practical setup

261
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:15,669
so you might have noticed

262
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,254
that this screen share streaming

263
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:19,236
that we are doing right now

264
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:22,101
is not the usual landscape whole

265
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,284
screen type of setup but we

266
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,869
have this vertical stream and the

267
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:28,392
idea of the vertical stream share

268
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:31,016
is that it really helps those

269
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,398
who have a single monitor

270
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:33,841
for example laptop users

271
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,323
because then you can keep

272
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:37,627
the twitch tv open in let's

273
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:38,709
say like you show here on the

274
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,492
left hand side of the screen

275
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,474
and then you have all the

276
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,557
right hand side free where you can put

277
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:45,400
for example the web browser

278
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,227
with the with the lessons with the materials

279
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,230
or your terminal if you

280
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,712
are learning it with the terminal

281
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:54,916
or vs code or any other

282
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,280
window that you might need

283
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,966
so this is very useful if

284
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,652
you have a single screen of course those

285
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:01,856
who have multiple screens they

286
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:04,405
can arrange the windows as they prefer

287
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,276
All right, I'm soon done

288
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,839
with all these intros.

289
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,342
I promise you I will.

290
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:12,984
This is the only day where

291
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:15,629
we do this long intro, but

292
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,572
I'm just very happy that there's

293
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:19,976
so many people involved in this workshop.

294
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:22,821
Again, we have now here it says 370,

295
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,584
which was the number from a few days ago,

296
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:25,746
but this morning it was

297
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:30,033
426 people registered from really

298
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,435
all over the world.

299
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,619
and behind the scenes

300
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,863
there's 15 coordinators and

301
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:38,447
helpers, instructors, facilitators.

302
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,751
It's a big work but we

303
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:43,035
hope that there is value in

304
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:46,842
all this energy that we put into this.

305
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,244
briefly on the workshop etiquette

306
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:50,626
as usual we try to be

307
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,368
nice to each other and you

308
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,509
have to understand that we

309
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,411
are very different some people

310
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,613
might be experienced coders who

311
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:58,454
have coded all their life

312
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,656
some people might have just started

313
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:01,937
or maybe not even will

314
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:03,519
never code they're just here to

315
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,900
learn the tools that their

316
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,022
coding colleagues are using so

317
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:08,904
let's just respect everybody else's

318
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:11,907
space and differences let's try

319
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:14,450
to be helpful in the collaborative document

320
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,434
And if something is not right,

321
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,920
if you feel that something is wrong,

322
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,243
we have a code of conduct

323
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:22,365
and you can get in touch

324
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,348
with the workshop organizer, Samantha

325
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,851
and I, or with the

326
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:30,785
general support at coderefinery.org address.

327
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,787
final notes well most of

328
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,629
you are registered if you register

329
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,713
you will get more emails from me reminders

330
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:42,118
and links and anything helpful

331
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,079
but of course you can also

332
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,722
just watch the the twitch tv stream

333
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:48,665
and and don't worry about it for those

334
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,147
who need certificates there's

335
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,909
a clear instructions there if

336
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,671
they're not clear please ask

337
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,813
in the notes document

338
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,050
And finally, Code Refinery is

339
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,871
an open project.

340
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,573
Anyone can join us.

341
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:01,535
If you follow the link

342
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,878
here, there are multiple ways to join us,

343
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:05,861
whether you like to receive emails

344
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,343
once in a while, not too

345
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,866
many, don't worry, or maybe

346
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,068
you want to actively join us.

347
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:13,912
For example, we host a Zulip channel

348
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:16,535
where many, many, many researchers

349
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,160
and software engineers and HPC admins,

350
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,323
they're all there and

351
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,346
answering each other's questions, sharing.

352
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,168
interesting links and sometimes

353
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,049
also funny memes.

354
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,315
But I think I've talked enough.

355
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,838
So maybe I'm going to ask [name].

356
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,440
Hello, [name].

357
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:38,363
[name] is here with us today

358
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:39,445
and he will be with us for

359
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:42,989
many days as the broadcasting

360
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,871
expert or broadcaster.

361
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,715
Is that broadcaster?

362
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:50,278
Broadcaster is good.

363
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,561
Expert is saying so much.

364
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,884
Well, as I was explaining earlier,

365
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,245
if you look at the distribution

366
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,547
of all the broadcasters in the

367
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:58,688
world, you are falling in

368
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,911
a quite high percentile.

369
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,172
But I'm asking you if you

370
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,814
can switch to the notes document

371
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:05,857
so that we can have a

372
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:07,239
look if there's already any.

373
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,223
This is the wrong one.

374
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,885
So sorry.

375
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:13,246
Okay.

376
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,007
Yes, this is.

377
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:15,248
Yes.

378
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,418
Okay.

379
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:21,750
so that we can have a look at

380
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,339
if there's anything relevant

381
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,703
in the questions and in the

382
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:30,092
meantime our first speaker or

383
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:34,057
our instructor can set up their screen share.

384
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:37,482
[name], there is one question.

385
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,084
Someone says that they are

386
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:39,785
not going through the

387
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,028
installation session because we see

388
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,931
that some people are very new.

389
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,514
That's a good question.

390
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:49,899
In our installation pages, there

391
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,142
is this minimum required installation,

392
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:54,526
which is just the fact if

393
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:57,610
you have a GitHub account, that's enough.

394
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,312
You can do the exercises

395
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:02,677
only using the GitHub web pages and

396
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:04,560
so you know you don't need

397
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,042
to worry i would say that

398
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,606
the more heavier part of the installation

399
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:09,667
which is the setting up

400
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,352
of a conda environment it's more needed

401
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,376
for from next week so for the part two

402
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,578
but for today and for the

403
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,581
next days having a github account

404
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,364
is all you need if you want

405
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:21,846
to of course not just use

406
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,330
the github website to work with

407
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,471
git because you want to do

408
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,314
vs code or the terminal

409
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,317
then you know if you didn't

410
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:30,358
have time to do it today you

411
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:32,161
can do it later in the afternoon and

412
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,244
if you need help we can set

413
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,146
up some ad hoc installations

414
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:39,000
sessions all right so I guess
