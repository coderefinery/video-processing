1.1 Icebreaker - SciComp/HPC Kickstart 2025 winter

General discussion before the workshop starts, about who we are and what we do.  You probably want to skip this unless you want to get a feeling for the course.

-----

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" in 2025 February. It's a shorter version of our 3-day summer workshop: we only have one intro, demos, and a wrap-up.  Still, the demo goes over all of the main things you need to know.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.
