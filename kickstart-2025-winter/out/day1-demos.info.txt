1.4 Demos of cluster usage - SciComp/HPC Kickstart 2025 winter

Here, we do a demo of all the steps of running programs on the cluster, from copying data and code, to initial test runs, to parallelism.  We don't go into too much depth for anything, but cover the main points you would want to read later.  You can follow up with the links below.

Our example is analyzing books from Project Gutenberg to compute ngrams.

Main tutorials: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/#tutorials

Git repo for the ngrams code: https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples/tree/master/ngrams

All the ngrams exercises on one page: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/exercises-ngrams/

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" in 2025 February. It's a shorter version of our 3-day summer workshop: we only have one intro, demos, and a wrap-up.  Still, the demo goes over all of the main things you need to know.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.
