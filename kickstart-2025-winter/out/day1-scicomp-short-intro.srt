1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,660
still have some 10 minutes [name] are you there? I'm here there was a short network

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,020
error but I think we have recovered. Okay was it on my side or on your side? It

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,580
It might be on my side.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,940
OK.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,140
So maybe I'll ask you.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,060
Did we say how people can write questions in the notes

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,620
at any time?

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,300
True.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,740
So that's the same notes document

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,420
that you already were using for these icebreakers.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,820
You can use it for writing questions there.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,060
And so anything that comes to your mind,

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,500
please write it there.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,380
And then we can give answers.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,320
It also gets all the links to whatever

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,000
we're looking at and any notes we're sending to you.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,080
And everyone you don't see on the stream

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,480
is there watching that and answering your questions.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,720
So go for it.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
Okay, that's all.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,640
Yes, we have a big network of helpers already.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,640
So if I ask you, Suza, what is scientific computing?

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,280
How would you answer that?

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,040
Basically, I would answer that scientific computing

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:21,760
is, at the baseline, every part of computing that helps science, that helps researchers.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,920
And then, obviously, you would want to ask, what is computing? And, well, computing is

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,520
using computers instead of pen and paper to solve your problems. So solving problems with

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,320
help of computer to help research is what scientific computing is.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Yes, I totally agree. There's this funny xkcd. Someone said that there's always an xkcd for

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,080
anything related to computing or computers. And you know, is this your machine learning system?

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,200
So you know, it's like a pile of stuff. And sometimes we have this maybe approach to computing

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,960
that we might not understand all the bits that are happening inside the pile. So we kind of maybe

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,400
have a kind of some sort of black box experience with the computing that some data comes in and

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,080
something comes out. So this very short introduction is actually trying to, you know, open this black

35
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,880
box. And I think it's still important to get the basic. So like [name] was saying, a common site,

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,400
if you're computing flowchart would be that you know that you have some data,

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,480
whether it's collected data or simulations, and then there is some processing happening,

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,680
and then you generate some outputs that can be statistical tables,

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,960
AI model, machine learning models, whatever is the output, and then you know you write papers,

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,200
posters, figures, and publish, and become successful, and you know be a famous scientist.

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,960
But then what actually happens in practice, and I think this is very important because

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,800
we were chatting with others that sometimes this jargon of the basically hardware that

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,480
is needed for doing scientific computing is just assumed that everybody knows about everything,

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,320
but maybe it is not like that.

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,720
And I also think that it's important once someone knows how the components are connected

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
with each other.

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,040
And if they're actually physically close to each other

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,100
or physically far away from each other,

49
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,960
then it can also affect, you know,

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
is it going to be fast?

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,240
Because yes, the memory that I'm using

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,960
is really few millimeters away

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,440
from the computing that is happening.

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,480
Or is it that the data that I'm loading

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,720
is far away in some remote server in the cloud,

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
as they say.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,600
So what do you see here in this type of stacked

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,000
picture is basically that we, you right now,

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
even with your laptop or with your desktop computer

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,520
that you're watching this stream,

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,000
or even with the phone, because the thing is similar.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,560
We have the hardware level and inside the hardware,

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,000
the physical box, there are CPUs, GPUs,

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,560
RAM, SSD, and the network.

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,320
So these elements, there are the definitions here

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,040
and we will not go through the definitions.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,640
Maybe this is familiar to all of you,

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,000
But already, if you feel that you don't know

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
what are all these elements,

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,480
then you already might be kind of missing

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,800
in the moment where you later you will see

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,560
that you request some computing resources

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,340
from an HPC cluster.

74
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,600
You are going to be asked, do you need CPUs?

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
How many do you need?

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,720
How much RAM do you need?

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,800
Do you need GPUs?

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,560
Do you need to use the local disk,

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,880
which is this SST here?

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,520
Or will you use some network disk

81
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,520
that is not physically inside the hardware that you use.

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,240
So these type of things are actually things

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,800
that you will need to think about daily

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,320
when you work with high-performance computing systems,

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,640
but they're basically things that sometimes you,

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,380
how can I say, forget that they are always there

87
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,300
whenever you are working.

88
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,160
On top of the hardware level,

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,580
there's the operating system

90
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,260
that basically is basically interacting with the hardware

91
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,260
and then enabling the fact that on top

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,340
of the operating system,

93
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,780
you can run your Python or MATLAB or R.

94
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,900
There's a nice little box here about containers.

95
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,180
We will not cover those today,

96
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,580
but basically it's like bringing another operating system

97
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,820
with the software on top of the operating system

98
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,660
and the hardware.

99
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,460
So without going through this definition

100
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,580
that maybe some of you have,

101
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,500
I just want to show that we have a great video series

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,260
on understanding computing through the kitchen metaphor.

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,140
So I will not show the video right now,

104
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,820
but it's linked in the page.

105
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,700
And in the video, there's gonna be [name] with a cat.

106
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,780
Actually, they are going to basically explain

107
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,260
how all these elements, the CPU, the GPU,

108
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,220
the RAM, and so on, are kind of connected to each other

109
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,100
and what it actually means in practice

110
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,340
for your day-to-day work.

111
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,060
There's also a set of slides

112
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,060
with this metaphor of the parallel computing in the kitchen.

113
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,260
And so the metaphor kind of goes,

114
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,820
if I can cover it just briefly,

115
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,500
we have still a couple of minutes,

116
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,620
that each burner of a stove is like a core,

117
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,700
it's like one of this CPU.

118
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,180
and then the whole store stove is like the processor.

119
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,180
Then, you have the memory, which is the counter space

120
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,460
where you can leave some of your ingredients that you need,

121
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
that you need to move inside these pots

122
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,820
on top of the burners.

123
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,100
And then of course, if the kitchen counter

124
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,660
have the ingredients that are ready easily to access,

125
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,820
you might have more ingredient

126
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,260
that are a little bit more far away in the fridge,

127
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,900
for example, or in some other cupboards.

128
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,820
And then you have the instructions, which is the program.

129
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,780
So the recipe that takes all these ingredients

130
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,580
and on top of one core or maybe more core,

131
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,780
if you need to cook multiple things in parallel,

132
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,260
can basically process the ingredients

133
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,020
and generate the output, which is the food.

134
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,660
We don't have time to go through this metaphor

135
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,580
and everything, but I really like this picture

136
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,140
that, for example, what if you don't have enough CPU

137
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,540
or enough memory.

138
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,460
This, I don't know if this has ever happened to you

139
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,760
in your kitchen, probably not.

140
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,540
But you know, you have these cases

141
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,820
where the kitchen counter is too small.

142
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,980
You just can't fit all the ingredients there.

143
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,740
You don't have enough burners to cook everything.

144
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,660
And so this is also when things might start slowing down

145
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,260
or maybe where your process might actually die

146
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,020
because you don't have enough memory and it gets killed.

147
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,600
Another last thing that I want to mention,

148
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,080
that sometimes people have expectations about clusters.

149
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,320
Working in a cluster doesn't necessarily means

150
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,080
that it's gonna be faster.

151
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,480
And here there's a nice example

152
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,400
that the laptop processing unit

153
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,920
might actually have more power than the stove

154
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,160
that has to share all the power

155
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,040
with the multiple processing units.

156
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,480
So often your laptop as a single processing unit

157
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,540
is much faster than let's say that the same processing unit

158
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,100
in a cluster, in a server.

159
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
But of course, it's also kind of the compromise

160
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,540
that on the laptop you have only one

161
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
or a handful of processing unit.

162
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,540
In the cluster, you can actually run thousands,

163
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,940
tens of thousands of processing unit in parallel.

164
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,380
But then again, what you need to understand

165
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,220
is that is your code written in a way

166
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,100
that can actually use the tens of thousands

167
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,300
of processing unit?

168
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,140
Or is it that when you move it to the cluster,

169
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,980
it will just use one processing unit,

170
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,560
which is actually slower than the one

171
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,060
that you have in your laptop.

172
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,360
So all of these will be covered later

173
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,260
with the example during the morning.

174
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,400
And just the final picture, the GPU.

175
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,420
I find it very funny.

176
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,300
So where GPUs are like the burners,

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,540
but in parallel, you can cook multiple,

178
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,940
in this case, you know, chickens.

179
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,760
So it's a large system that at the same time

180
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,980
can do the same operation multiple times.

181
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,560
So hopefully this was, how can I say,

182
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,880
inspiring enough and motivating enough

183
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,480
and maybe you all knew about these things.

184
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,160
We don't really have time to cover this

185
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,560
but you can read this page

186
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,120
and there's even a video related to this page.

187
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,080
But basically this is what I was just saying

188
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,880
that sometimes moving the stuff to the cluster

189
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,200
doesn't automatically make things faster.

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,720
So, I'm basically ready to switch to pass the ...

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,800
Or do you want to add anything, Suza,

192
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,520
that might be good for clarifying?

193
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,640
No, I think you covered most things.

194
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,760
Excellent. So, I would also switch the screen

195
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,280
to [name] and [name],

196
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,160
but do you want me first to explain a bit

197
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,600
of the geography of the cluster or will you go through, you know, what is the login node then?

198
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,840
I think it's probably good if you would explain that.

199
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,600
All right, so basically one thing, like you're all familiar with your own laptop or desktop, you

200
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,600
log in with your username and password and basically this is where you would be, you know,

201
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,520
that you have a desktop or you have a laptop it can be in the Alto network that you see here because

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:06,040
it's in a it's in a it's in a office at Alto or maybe you're at home in the internet with your

203
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,880
with your laptop so then we Alto uses this virtual private network and the idea is not to make your

204
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,680
life more difficult the idea is that once you know that your laptop your personal laptop or

205
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,440
or your computer that are part of the network,

206
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,960
then other bits that are inside the network

207
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,740
also becomes accessible.

208
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,040
The reason, of course, is kind of confidentiality

209
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,200
of the information that might be moving

210
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,300
between these different elements.

211
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,760
And in general, it also makes it easier

212
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,420
to prevent external attacks.

213
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,560
So using the VPN in the end is useful,

214
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,440
but of course there are also ways to connect to this system

215
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,480
without necessarily being in the VPN.

216
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
But for simplicity, let's say that now

217
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
you're in the Alto VPN.

218
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
So now you actually have access

219
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
to all these different elements that you see here.

220
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
There are the department workstation,

221
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,160
maybe you have one, or maybe that you're given a laptop.

222
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,120
We also have this type of external interface,

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,120
vdi.alto.fi, where you can basically get a virtual desktop.

224
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
That's the VD, virtual desktop interface,

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,680
so that you know you are, I don't know,

226
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,040
out for a conference, but you don't have

227
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
your Alto laptop with you and you need to access something,

228
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
you can always go to this vdi.alto.fi

229
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
and see the file system,

230
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,720
the same thing that you will still see in the department.

231
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,020
And then there's the Triton cluster.

232
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,320
So the idea of the cluster

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,800
is that there is another network inside the network.

234
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,760
And this network between these hundreds of computers

235
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,020
is actually very, very fast, extremely fast.

236
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,200
It's called InfiniBand,

237
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
and it's a type of connectivity

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
between all these multiple computers that we have there

239
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,300
that it allows really quick exchange of information.

240
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,700
Instead, if something from the Triton cluster

241
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,860
would need to talk, let's say,

242
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,380
with the department or station

243
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,740
or with the storage that is outside of the Triton network,

244
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,300
things would already feel slower.

245
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,220
The thing is that to enter the Triton cluster network,

246
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,280
you need to go through the so-called login node,

247
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,700
which is triton.data.fi.

248
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,220
Now I put this sign there,

249
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,700
which is, for those who have a driving license,

250
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,220
it means that you should not stop there,

251
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,340
even if you wanna stop the car for a few seconds,

252
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,660
it's not good, you need to move on.

253
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,140
And the idea is that the login node

254
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,660
is good for connecting to the cluster,

255
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,020
running simple things,

256
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,540
but then what you wanna do is getting a dedicated node

257
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,980
that is just for you with the resources that you need.

258
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,340
Do you need a CPU, one CPU, many CPUs,

259
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,660
a little RAM, lots of RAM, and so on.

260
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,100
This will come clearer with the examples

261
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,860
that are given in the morning

262
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,740
and also later in the afternoon with the exercises.

263
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,980
Then Triton has its own storage system.

264
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,220
And the reason is exactly is this speed reason

265
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,260
that if Triton would try to access the storage system

266
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,420
that you have in other Alto computers,

267
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,220
it would take the Alto network down

268
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,700
because all the IO that is going on between the nodes

269
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,780
and the external storage will be too much.

270
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,300
So this is why we have a dedicated

271
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,780
so-called scratch storage system.

272
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,800
The disadvantage of that,

273
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
the good thing is that Scratch is huge.

274
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
We have five petabytes of Scratch space,

275
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,760
and it's also very fast to read and write,

276
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,520
but the problem with Scratch is that it's not backed up,

277
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,120
and it's kind of the price to pay

278
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,960
for having a huge and fast file system.

279
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,400
So you understand that it's,

280
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,480
this is the similar kind of architecture

281
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
is also in other computing cluster like CSC.

282
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,120
So you understand that it's every time you kind of feel

283
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,440
that your analysis is ready,

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,880
it's time to move it out of the scratch file system.

285
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,200
Last thing that I want to mention is that we also have

286
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,480
a kind of virtual desktop interface to the Triton cluster

287
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,820
in this ondemand.triton.aalto.fi.

288
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,960
So if, again, you are not with your computer

289
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,960
or you need to visualize the files that you have generated

290
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,040
or the picture or it runs on Jupyter Notebook,

291
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,440
then this is the website that you want to visit.

292
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
And I think I covered everything.

293
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:20,440
How do you actually get, if you want to move something out from scratch, how do you get it out?

294
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Yeah, this will be my understanding some of the examples in the morning, but basically there are different ways.

295
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,440
One way actually would be exactly this with this on demand, for example, that you can see the file system and get something out.

296
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,320
But of course, there are all these other,

297
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,240
in our documentation, we have, for example,

298
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,240
you can actually, how can I say,

299
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,080
make this file system visible in your operating system.

300
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,800
So let's say that you have, I don't know,

301
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,400
out the windows, you can actually make a scratch

302
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,840
so that you see it with all the other letters

303
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,080
of the disks that you have there.

304
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,120
And then from there, you can basically copy some files out.

305
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,960
So there's multiple different ways

306
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,320
of getting data in and out of the Scratch file system.

307
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,000
And we will show a bit of those.

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
But yes, that's a very, very important question

309
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,680
that we often get.

310
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,920
All right, so is there something to lift up

311
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
from the notes document

312
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
or do you wanna take the screen share?

313
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,000
There is some stuff there.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,800
I guess I can switch to the notes.

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,560
Do you have the notes open on your computer

316
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,440
or should I switch there?

317
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,320
I should have them here.

318
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

319
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,560
In the kitchen metaphor,

320
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,560
what are the notes we define for Slurm?

321
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,040
Yeah, this is a good question.

322
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,800
Maybe Slurm can be seen as the chef manager that coordinates

323
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,280
all the other little chefs in the multiple kitchens that

324
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,720
are in this department, or in this apartment building.

325
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,480
And I don't know if that's a good metaphor,

326
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,000
but I see that people are answering, so that's good.

327
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,420
Is there a smart way to move data between Triton, Scratch,

328
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,080
and department?

329
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,920
Yeah, this will be covered.

330
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,400
And it's partly covered.

331
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,000
All right, I don't think there's anything to mention.

332
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,880
So maybe we can now switch to you, [name] and [name].

333
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,340
Yes.
