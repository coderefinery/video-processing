1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,980
Uh, there you go.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,780
So see you later.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,020
So the page that I'm showing right now,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,640
the webpage that I'm showing is the same

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,880
that you have received in the email if you register.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,500
And if you have access also to this notes document

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,380
that you've been using for writing your answers,

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,780
it's also at the very top.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,340
And this is basically kind of the collection of links

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,740
that we will use throughout the day.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,420
So if I scroll down to the schedule,

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,060
we are basically here.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,300
And very briefly, I give you a little start

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,100
or a little intro of what is happening right now

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,620
and what is this.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,900
So I guess you already heard who we are.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,500
We are the people from other scientific computing,

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,060
kind of our part of the School of Science.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,020
We help everyone at Aalto basically,

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,820
we support large performance, high performance computing.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,500
And as [name] just said, all sorts of requests

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,580
that can be related to software,

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,780
but not only software, also data,

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,740
open science and many other things.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,820
We are well integrated with all the other

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,100
research services network and IT services networks.

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,460
So we're all in working together

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,140
to support people at Aalto University.

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,860
On top of that, we also collaborate a lot

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,300
with other universities in Finland and with CSC,

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,500
which is the main partner for computational resources

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,100
for basically all the Finnish researchers.

33
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,180
And we also belong to the Code Refinery Network,

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,700
which is a network that spans across all the Nordic countries

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,500
where we organize this type of workshop.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,460
The course for today, normally we have this course

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,300
and we will have this course as a three days course,

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,620
so much longer and much slower.

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,480
We have it in the first week of June,

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,160
and we do it because that's the week

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,800
when the summer workers are joining at the university.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,840
So usually the scale there is much bigger.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,680
We have 300 participants,

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,240
and then we basically,

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,480
instead of having just a single day like we have today,

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,080
we have multiple days where we can cover

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,640
in detail all the topics.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
So if you wish to have a more in-depth,

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
like deeper overview of everything.

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
I recommend joining the June version,

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
the longer version of this course.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,440
But now here, most of you already have a Triton account,

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,040
already have maybe even submitted jobs

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,880
and work with Triton.

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,720
So this is more like a compressed two hours

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,960
of what can you do with HPC and specifically with Triton.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,620
And then in the afternoon, we can actually spend time.

58
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,720
We have three hours together where we can do

59
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,160
whether you want to do the basic exercises that we have,

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,860
or maybe you want to learn how to run large language models

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,360
like local large language models on Triton,

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,880
or maybe you have more advanced needs,

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,040
whether you need to use GPUs

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,200
or some other more advanced parallel programming.

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,520
So the afternoon part, if you want to join,

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,440
that will happen in Zoom,

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,420
and it would be much more interactive.

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,920
I don't basically need to go through all the practicalities,

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,660
but maybe what you're already feeling right now

70
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,660
that instead of being in a Zoom room,

71
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,940
right now we're using Twitch TV,

72
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,580
which is basically like a TV streaming.

73
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,180
And the main advantage is that with Twitch TV,

74
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,640
as soon as the streaming stops,

75
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,980
the recording will be immediately available

76
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,580
so that you can re-watch it later today

77
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,420
or whenever you want.

78
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,420
And on top of that, we don't have the issue that,

79
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,780
you know, sometimes in Zoom,

80
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,580
there might be some participants that might appear

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,580
on the screen or maybe a microphone that are not unmuted.

82
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,100
So we don't have this type of issues.

83
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,180
Basically, what else can I say

84
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,180
that we use this type of vertical screen sharing?

85
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,900
And the reason is that for those who have only one screen,

86
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,740
so kind of laptop users,

87
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,780
they can have within the same screen space,

88
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,560
basically a space for the Twitch stream,

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,180
where they can watch the streaming

90
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,700
and in the other, in the rest of the screen,

91
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,460
they can keep the web browser open and so on.

92
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,100
Of course, if you have multiple screens,

93
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,140
you don't have this issue,

94
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,100
but with this approach, we are able,

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,860
you should be able to always have the window,

96
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,380
the streaming window visible.

97
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,700
Maybe I don't need to go through everything,

98
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,940
but if something goes wrong, it can happen, stay in tune and, you know, if the streaming

99
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,740
disappears or something like that, we will try to get it back and if there's larger technical

100
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:01,260
issues, we have already a plan B for everything. Just a last reminder that, you know, we follow

101
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,900
the Alto Code of Conduct and so we hope that this is a great experience for everyone and if you

102
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:16,340
feel that something is wrong just get in touch with one of the organizers so we

103
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,000
still have some 10 minutes [name] are you there? I'm here there was a short network
