1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280
Okay.

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:09,840
Okay, so now we're in the pre-live or pre-main course icebreaker time, where we'll talk to

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,860
you a little bit and get ready to go.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:23,120
So what you see shared here is the, what we call the notes document, or just notes.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,780
It is a place where everyone can edit, so you can't see it on this share.

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,700
if you go up here you can switch to an edit mode and then you can write stuff here so it's marked

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,500
down the exact format doesn't matter that much but the important thing is if you take it up and the

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,460
only people that have it are people that have registered so you should have just gotten a

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,940
reminder email that also has this inside of it is that true okay yes and if you scroll down to the

10
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:04,700
bottom you see icebreakers here. So the purpose of this is you can come and you

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,280
can switch to edit mode and answer these questions and we'll discuss. So for

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,280
example I just put an "o" right here to show that I'm very familiar with command

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,880
line in Shell. So it's sort of like a bar graph we're making collaboratively. So

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:34,160
Everyone go open this up, vote for whichever one there is, and we can get an idea of how

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,160
we should be presenting stuff.

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:45,520
So the questions are, how familiar are you with command line shell?

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,400
Have you used version control before?

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,920
types of computers have used for work before? What types of programming you do? And then just

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,720
a free-form question and answer. What kinds of scientific work do you do or think you do? Like,

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,800
whether it's machine learning stuff or physics or chemistry, whatever it may be.

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:21,700
Okay, let's talk about what our answers for these would be. So, first off, I'm [name]

22
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,940
[name]. I work at Aalto University in the Aalto Scientific Computing team, and our job is

23
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:38,600
basically to help you with scientific computing kind of work. I guess you probably know that

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
because that's why we're here giving this course.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,760
So of these topics here, I'd say I'm probably

26
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,120
very familiar with command line shell.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
I use it all the time and script in it.

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,880
I've done plenty of version control before.

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,320
I've used mostly own laptops, desktops, group servers,

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,620
and high performance clusters.

31
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,920
And my main programming is in Python and shell scripting.

32
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,220
[name], would you like to introduce yourself?

33
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,020
Yeah, so hi everybody.

34
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,860
My name is [name].

35
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,540
I'm a research software engineer

36
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,420
in the autoscientific computing.

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,040
So on the topics, yeah, I would say that I'm very familiar

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,020
with the command line nowadays.

39
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,500
I've worked in these topics for years, years now.

40
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,220
Have I used version control? Yes.

41
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,220
In fact, just yesterday we were talking about anecdotes

42
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,380
on how, where we learned some of these skills.

43
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,760
And in my first summer job in Aalto University,

44
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,460
my supervisor wanted me to learn how to use version control

45
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,460
and that has definitely paid off.

46
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,080
Like that was years and years ago.

47
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,020
What type of computers have I used before?

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Mainly, I do my work from my own laptop

49
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,020
and connecting from that to various other machines

50
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,020
like HPC clusters and a remote desktop and such.

51
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,020
So the laptop is the connection that I use

52
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,020
to the wider computing world.

53
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,020
But I would say that all of those are basically

54
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,020
what I've used so far.

55
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:42,140
My programming background is on the physics side, but nowadays Python, I would say, is the one glue

56
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:50,060
that glues most of the coding together. I would say Python is my main language, and then I would

57
00:04:50,060 --> 00:05:00,460
say maybe C or shell scripting, I wouldn't know really. But yeah, basically whatever works for

58
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:08,380
the specific case at hand. Yeah, great. And [name], would you like to introduce yourself some?

59
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,940
Yeah, okay. Hi, so I'm [name]. I'm, I think, the newest member still of the

60
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,780
research software engineering team. Regarding the icebreaker questions, well, I'm familiar with

61
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,700
the command line. I've used it for a long time now, but I wouldn't say that I'm very familiar

62
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,300
with it. There's certainly areas I could still learn something about it. I've been using version

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,260
control for a fair bit as well. Still sort of a myth that I didn't use version control for my

64
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:53,100
PhD studies, but that's what it was back then. And well, I worked on my own computers,

65
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,540
as laptops and desktop.

66
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,060
I've worked remotely,

67
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,700
and I've also worked on the cluster.

68
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,380
Nowadays, that's just like similar.

69
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,540
I mostly do Python programming-wise,

70
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,900
but I've done a fair bit of other things.

71
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
I've done Matlab, I've done R, I've done C.

72
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:26,940
I've done SDCC, if anyone knows about that, it stands for Small Devices C Compiler, it's

73
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:39,500
for very close to hardware programming, and that's basically what there is to tell about

74
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,060
me in terms of computing, I think.

75
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Okay, cool.

76
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,660
[name], would you like to introduce yourself?

77
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
Yes.

78
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
Hello everybody.

79
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,260
couple of minutes before kind of the official start and before mentioning something about myself I'm

80
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,700
checking the answers that you've been writing for those who join now you should have received

81
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:06,940
this notes document at notes.coderefinery.org and there you can basically edit the document

82
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,260
it's like a google doc but everyone can edit but it's just text based and when it comes to me

83
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:20,220
I work with the same team as [name], [name], and [name], and yes, I'm very familiar with the

84
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:29,660
command line. I started in, I think it was 1983 with the Commodore 64, and the only interface

85
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:40,060
was the command line. 1983? Yeah, I think that's when I got my first computer. I mean,

86
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,580
The commands that I was tapping was more like load and then name of the game.

87
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,340
I don't remember now the basic commands, but you know, that was my first interface

88
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,740
interaction with the computer.

89
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,580
Even though I was ex-sport, because my dad with this job, he also has access to one of

90
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,180
these computers with punch cards.

91
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,900
So I've seen also those back in the days, but more, you know, back to nowadays, yes,

92
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,980
the command line is maybe the most powerful tool.

93
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,980
I will share a link actually, there's a nice nature paper

94
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,300
that they show how important it is to learn the command line

95
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,580
or all type of science.

96
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,140
Virtual control, it's actually all the pages,

97
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,020
the web pages that you see that we in our documentation

98
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,780
or even the websites that we share sometimes,

99
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,980
they're all actually based using,

100
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,380
they're all written and shared through Git and GitHub.

101
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,900
So even though it's not just for, you know,

102
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,020
keeping track of your code,

103
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,660
it can also be very useful for publishing.

104
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,460
And in general, I mean, a bit of Python, a bit of R,

105
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,580
MATLAB, I used a lot of MATLAB in the past

106
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,540
because with neuroscience, which is my background,

107
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,520
we have lots of those tools.

108
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,380
But great to see that many people are connected.

109
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,740
There's 41 people in this HedgeDoc notes document.

110
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,960
So if you feel that it's getting a bit slow,

111
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,040
you can switch to the view mode.

112
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,780
And what were you saying, [name]?

113
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,020
Yeah, and I guess we're about to start.

114
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,600
If we look at the icebreaker answers here,

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,960
people are basically answering what we'd expect.

116
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,200
So the audience as a whole seems to be

117
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,520
at the right level for this course.

118
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,520
So we are not talking about the prerequisites

119
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,520
of most of these kinds of things.

120
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:40,680
important tools you'll use but not the main topic of the course. Our main topic is this section

121
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:48,360
right here. Although our team doesn't just support the cluster, we support everything that you see

122
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,560
on this list. So as you'll learn later on, we have different help sessions where you can come

123
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,440
and we're around to help with all of these things because we completely understand that computers are

124
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,520
complex. There's just so many different things that people have to know and learn in order to

125
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,320
do stuff. And that's why our team's funded. So you can focus on your work and we focus on

126
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,080
the other stuff. With that being said, I guess it's time to start. So I believe it's

127
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,880
[name] and [name] with the intro. So I'll hide myself and switch to [name]'s screen.
