1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
There.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,980
Now it works.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,980
Okay.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,980
Yes.

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,980
We're getting the sharing set up properly.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:21,980
Now we've had this nice demo, and I think, well, if I was learning here.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:31,260
the things I would have understood hopefully and well now I know from own experience I've

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,020
learned it now I've heard this all this and I think I understand it but in a week or so

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:48,220
I will realize I forgot half of it and I actually didn't really understand the details of this

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:57,260
suspect. So where do I go? What can I do? I can answer to this question with our beautiful help

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:04,220
page. So in our web pages that hopefully are already familiar to you, we have a section all

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,220
dedicated to help. We even have a video actually there a few years ago in a similar workshop like

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,860
this one we had a guest [name] from Code Refinery Norway he gave a nice short video on how

14
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,500
to ask for help because often sometimes the problem you have it might not be exactly you know

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,780
the actual problem that you might be having and so if you know that you might have a problem or even

16
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,900
if you don't know what type of problem there are multiple ways of getting help from us maybe the

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,320
The one out of the many ways, the one that I can mention is the so-called Garage, which

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,700
is a daily Zoom session that we are hosting at 1 p.m.

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,900
And the barrier is extremely low.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,780
You might not even know what is your question or what is your problem.

21
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,580
And it's not even limited to Triton or to parallel processing or things like that.

22
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,540
We get people that they might just need basic IT help, or we even get people with questions

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,060
related to privacy, ethics, security, you know, even though we are not maybe the best

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,500
persons at Aalto to answer this question, but we most likely know someone who is the

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
best person.

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,660
So the barrier is extremely low, just come there every day at 1pm.

27
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,980
And then of course, when things get a little bit more complicated, they start to become

28
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,900
more like a consultation.

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,940
And so for that, we have the issue tracker, where you can basically paste a bit of your

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,780
code and you know something that cannot be solved quickly in within the one hour of the garage

31
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:46,260
session and of course that's the documentation that we have here in in general also we try to

32
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,900
also host some focus days in the in the garage so now I opened the garage space and so sometimes

33
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,300
we get guests from some departments as key so the IT services from from those departments

34
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,140
And sometimes, for example, we have this special day.

35
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,540
So recently we've been running the COMSOL

36
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,140
Multiphysics Focus Day every Wednesday.

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,940
So if you know that you're gonna use COMSOL

38
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,740
and you're not sure if your setup is optimal with Triton,

39
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,160
then that is the place to come for with.

40
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,820
So yeah, basically this is how to get help.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,660
Maybe we still have a few minutes.

42
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,540
I could talk about kind of where to go from here.

43
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,420
In this page, which is the same page

44
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,400
where there's the upcoming courses

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,320
that we are hosting slash co-hosting.

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,020
If you scroll to the bottom,

47
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,100
there's also this nice picture

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,340
that [name] draw a few years ago,

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,380
which is kind of the skills map

50
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,820
when it comes to computing in general,

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,620
scientific computing.

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,220
So most of you here, for example,

53
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,660
have the type of basic skills that I even briefly cover

54
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,420
in the morning, understanding the hardware and the software

55
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,860
that you might be using.

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,260
And then, of course, sometimes you

57
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,420
need something a little bit more specific to your field,

58
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,620
whether it's simulations or whatever

59
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,020
is the kind of more science-related skills.

60
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,420
And then we start going that, before going

61
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,780
to the cluster and HPC, and the more advanced uses or tools

62
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,380
that we can use along with our coding

63
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,100
and scientific computing.

64
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,140
It's important to, you know, learn the Linux shell

65
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,220
and sometimes not just type in a few commands,

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,420
but as you already saw today,

67
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,040
sometimes you need to write a script.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,940
So those scripts that you saw today,

69
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,660
they were so-called LRM scripts,

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,860
but in practice they are shell scripts.

71
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,380
And then on top of that, this is where we are here today

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,420
in learning our cluster and HPC are working.

73
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,540
When it comes to scientific coding,

74
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:04,940
there are more courses that we offer and in this i'm gonna mention that exactly one month from

75
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,340
today we have the next round of the code refinery workshop you can already register at this link

76
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:18,300
the code refinery workshop is a half six half days that are basically covering the basics of

77
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,300
of where is the schedule?

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,540
I don't see it here.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,080
No, this is actually the lessons, but oh yeah,

80
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,760
it was here above, sorry.

81
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Yes, Code Refinery March 25.

82
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,440
So the first three days, the first week of Code Refinery

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
covers everything about Git version control.

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
And we also cover kind of how to use GitHub

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,160
and the features that GitHub provides

86
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,320
so that you can create issues, pull requests and so on.

87
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,020
So it's very useful for this type of collaborative coding.

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,480
And then the second half focuses on reproducibility,

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,120
specifically the so-called computational reproducibility

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,000
and kind of there's a little bit more kind of,

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
how could I say, best practices

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,200
when it comes to scientific computing.

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,200
So automated testing and this type of continuous integration

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,380
and modular code development and so on.

95
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:23,140
So, basically, the last thing that I want to mention before we go for lunch break is

96
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,820
also that we have been running many of these courses in the past, and almost everything

97
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,220
is available in our YouTube channel, so you can kind of retake a past course.

98
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,780
But if you feel that it would be nice that we do a rerun of a past course, or maybe if

99
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,220
if you feel that something is missing in your curriculum

100
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,540
and you would really need something new

101
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,060
that we've never been running,

102
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,820
we have this form where people,

103
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,580
where you can basically request reruns of older courses

104
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,460
or a run of new courses.

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,460
And so here you see a long list of GitHub, Python, Julia.

106
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,900
This is the one where we are right now,

107
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
introduction to HPC and so on.

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,900
So, I think this is all cover for today.

109
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,740
Maybe I mentioned now for the exercises,

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,140
the exercises will happen in Zoom.

111
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,280
And the reason is that we will not be recording

112
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,780
what happens in the exercises room.

113
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,660
So you are free to use your microphone,

114
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,420
show your screen if you're having an error

115
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,300
that you want us to look at.

116
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,960
We will split in multiple rooms,

117
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,300
depending on what you wanna test

118
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,820
or what do you wanna learn.

119
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,840
In room number one,

120
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,480
we will basically go through all the exercises

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,000
on the Triton tutorials one by one

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,240
from connection to the login node

123
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,540
up to running this array jobs and other parallel things.

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,440
So this is highly recommended

125
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,080
if you recently got a Triton account

126
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,440
but basically never really use Triton.

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,720
Room 2 is more for helps if you have issues with connecting to Triton or other issues that could

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,240
be related to account, Triton account. And room 3 will be a little bit more advanced where for

129
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,280
those users who already are maybe familiar with connecting to Triton and running some

130
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,920
sbatch SLURM jobs but maybe you your needs are you know you might be needing CPUs, GPUs, or more

131
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:42,200
advanced parallelization and then we have one room dedicated to how to use large language models

132
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,640
and on Triton we actually store already some popular open source language models and we have

133
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,840
even a little bit of examples on how to run those local models so this is you know kind of a hands-on

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,080
way for testing that and finally room number five is the speech-to-text which is a tool that's been

135
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,400
used a lot by Aalto. Aalto doctoral researchers where, for example, the need of this tool

136
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,120
is that you might be collecting an interview, so in the form of speech, and this is a tool

137
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,880
that transcribes the interview into text. And for security and for confidentiality,

138
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,680
this all runs on Triton, so you don't need to, you know, upload your sensitive interview

139
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,020
outside of the Aalto network. And so for those who are interested in that, you can try speech

140
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:40,340
the text with the demo in room number five. It's 12 o'clock. I think we are done. Is there anything

141
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,500
to bring up from the notes? I would say that please give us feedback at the end of the notes.

142
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,900
At the end of the notes, there's this quick polling and you can give us also feedback

143
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,540
at the end. So please give us feedback on how did you find the course.

144
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,340
Because this is the first time we have done this kind of like a one-day quick kickstart

145
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,380
and it's good to get feedback on how it went in your mind.

146
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:16,060
So please leave us good and negative feedback, both welcome, because that will make the course

147
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
better.

148
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
Yeah.

149
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
All right.

150
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,740
So have a good rest of the day.

151
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:38,500
So hopefully some of you will join us for the exercises in Zoom and yeah, great.

152
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Thanks a lot.

153
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
See you later.

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Bye.

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Bye.

156
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Bye.
