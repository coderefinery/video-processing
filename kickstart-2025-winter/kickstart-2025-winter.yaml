- workshop_description: >
    This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started
    with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" in 2025 February.
    It's a shorter version of our 3-day summer workshop: we only have
    one intro, demos, and a wrap-up.  Still, the demo goes over all of
    the main things you need to know.  The videos are available to
    everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the
    workshop and want to review later.

    General discussion before the workshop starts, about who we are
    and what we do.  You probably want to skip this unless you want to
    get a feeling for the course.

  title: 1.4 Demos of cluster usage
  description: >-
    Here, we do a demo of all the steps of running programs on the
    cluster, from copying data and code, to initial test runs, to
    parallelism.  We don't go into too much depth for anything, but
    cover the main points you would want to read later.  You can follow
    up with the links below.

    Our example is analyzing books from Project Gutenberg to compute
    ngrams.

    Main tutorials: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/#tutorials

    Git repo for the ngrams code: https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples/tree/master/ngrams

    All the ngrams exercises on one page: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/exercises-ngrams/
