5.2 Jupyter - CodeRefinery 2025 Mar

This lesson teachs learners the user interface of JupyterLab, how Jupyter notebooks work, and what some common and powerful usecases are. Our focus is to demonstrate and discuss and guide towards good practices for reproducibility, collaboration, and reusability. The emphasis of this lesson is to demonstrate how to use notebooks in combination with version control and how to share reproducible notebooks via Binder.

This lesson demonstrates the use of JupyterLab, nbdime, jupyterlab-git, and Binder.
