1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Okay, bye.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,560
So hello everyone,

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,320
and welcome to this,

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,000
what we just found out to be the 11th

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,480
of our big code refinery workshops,

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,760
big meaning beyond 100 people

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,640
and online and open for everyone.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,720
So we'll be going through some practicalities now.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
So maybe first, hi, I'm [name].

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm a research software engineer at CSC in Finland.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,160
And I'll be teaching with together with [name],

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,160
actually day four of reproducible research and social coding.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,960
And now for the first 20 minutes,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,080
we'll be looking at the intro.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,040
So you have the link to the intro also

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
in the collaborative notes.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
And yes, and it's also linked from the site.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,920
So if you go to the schedule where you can find

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,280
exactly what we will be showing now,

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,560
and from the schedule,

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,240
you can also find every day's materials

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,680
that we'll be going through.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,080
So the schedule is a good page to have open on the sites.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,400
So first, why are we actually here?

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,840
So what is this about?

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,040
So code refinery is not the general coding class,

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,040
but it's everything or a lot of things beyond that.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,440
So we will not be talking about how to code something

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,480
in a specific language,

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,680
but we will go through things that help you

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,880
around the actual writing code.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,600
Like this picture shows you very nicely.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,320
That's by our friend Heidi Seibold.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,640
And we always like to use it because it shows

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,280
like the six helpful steps to reproducible research.

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,840
And that's basically where all of our lessons fit in somehow.

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,760
So we talk about getting your files and folders in order.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,400
How do you do that?

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,600
How do you use good names, files, folders, and functions?

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Documenting from README to something more extensive

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,640
and when that might be needed.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
We will talk about version control a lot

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,120
now the first three days in particular.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,480
And then we'll also talk about stabilizing

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,560
the computing environment and software,

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,080
and then how to publish your research outputs.

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,520
And here it's in particular about code.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,080
So what's code refinery?

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,400
We are a Nordic project that are teaching these kind

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
of basic scientific computing tools.

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,320
We are funded by the Nordic infrastructure collaboration

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
and our partner organizations.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
And a bit below you can see our current partners.

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
We are actually starting our fourth phase in May.

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
And we have existed since 2016

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,920
and have been running workshops since then.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
We are running this workshop and we are also running

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,480
others like it.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,200
For example, Python for scientific computing.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,880
We have been doing tools and techniques for HPC

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,200
was one of the collaboration projects that we were doing.

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,000
So if that's all sounds interesting,

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,240
please go on our website and check out

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,040
all of the other materials as well.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,360
And we are also a community of research software enthusiasts

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,440
and you can join that and more about that later.

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
But for now, practical matters, how to attend.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
You may have already found out

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
that this is not your usual workshop.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,520
So we're not all in a Zoom room,

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,080
but we are talking to you via a stream.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
That also means that we don't have a Zoom chat

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
where you can interact like you are maybe used to.

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,600
But instead of that, we have our collaborative document.

75
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,840
So how this will work is that everyone,

76
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,320
no matter if you're doing this on your own or with a team

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,840
or with a group of strangers in some place,

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,120
you will watch the live stream

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,320
and there will be instructors talking and showing demos.

80
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,200
And in week one, we will also have exercises

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,840
where we will be quiet on stream.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,440
We will give you some time to run through the exercises.

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,200
Almost all of them, or most of them have also solutions.

84
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,320
So you can go through them also yourself.

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,120
And you can always ask questions

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,400
whenever they come up during exercises, during classes,

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,280
the teaching, and also a little bit after the workshop still.

88
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,520
And we will not have any dedicated team exercises in week two,

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,840
but more interaction via the collaborative notes.

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,800
And the materials for week two

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,880
will also include exercise materials,

92
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,680
which you can run through on your own pace after the workshop.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,000
We plan to have a minimum of 10 minutes break every hour,

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,360
and the materials are always available

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,280
for everyone.

96
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,200
And they're linked from the workshop page.

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,000
And all the recordings will be available on Twitch

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
right after the workshop.

99
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,920
So don't worry if you need to go for an hour or so

100
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,120
to do something else, you can always come back

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,560
and then re-watch the part that you missed right away on Twitch.

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,240
Or also we try to put all the recordings on YouTube

103
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,640
latest the day after the workshop.

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,080
And there will be a playlist with the 2025 workshop.

105
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,680
The collaborative document [name] and [name]

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,960
have already shown it a little bit.

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
Maybe we can switch there now as well.

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,160
So everyone who registered got at least one,

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,680
probably more emails from [name] with all the links

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
where you've found also this link to this stream.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
And then there was also a link to the notes.

112
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,440
And that's this one.

113
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,760
So there is a lot of information in the top.

114
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,200
There's also a suggestion on,

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,480
how you can set up your laptop screen

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,080
to be able to watch what we are doing.

117
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,560
And at the same time do exercises and have the notes open.

118
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,120
So we are sharing in this kind of,

119
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,400
you may have noticed this narrow format

120
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
to enable you to have multiple things

121
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,400
even on a small laptop screen.

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,800
One important note on the notes,

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,000
please do not put any names or any other identifying

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,640
information on this page,

125
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,320
because as you see, we will be showing it on stream

126
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,280
and we will also be archiving it later.

127
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,360
In case there is some identifying information

128
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,440
or something, we will remove that before archiving,

129
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,200
but it will still be visible on stream.

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,560
But please don't hesitate to ask any kind of questions.

131
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
This is an anonymous document.

132
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,760
Your name is not visible by default.

133
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,440
And how you edit this document is that you have to find

134
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,880
now this little pen symbol, and it might be,

135
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,760
up there where it is on our screen,

136
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,160
or it might be somewhere on the left together

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
with some other symbols,

138
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,960
but it's always this little pen symbol.

139
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,640
And that switches you to the edit mode of this document.

140
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,440
And the document itself is markdown based,

141
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,160
but you don't really have to worry about it.

142
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
So you can just write plain text

143
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,680
as you have been doing here already in the icebreaker.

144
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,800
And if you haven't answered the icebreaker yet,

145
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
now is a very good time to also get used to the collaboration

146
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,120
collaborative document and tell us what's the weather like where you are.

147
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,120
And hopefully there's also some people sending a little bit of sunshine.

148
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,880
Then there's also another icebreaker,

149
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,280
which introduces one way of how we can do polls with this collaborative notes,

150
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,000
meaning we have a question and then you can answer your option by

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,640
adding an O to your option.

152
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,320
Then we will also use this document to distribute links.

153
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,320
Like I mentioned, the links are also all available from the schedule,

154
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,120
but we will also share them in the collaborative notes and always put

155
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,520
sections in that you always know where we are.

156
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,120
And during exercises and breaks, we will also write here

157
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,240
when we will be back on stream and when it will continue.

158
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,960
So you always know what's going

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,640
on. So if you have to leave, just scroll all the way down to the

160
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,040
collaborative notes and then you'll see where we are at at the moment.

161
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Let me just check that I haven't forgotten anything.

162
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,840
Sometimes

163
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,560
you might have to refresh or update the document to get all the latest

164
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,120
information, especially if there's many people editing at the same time.

165
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
We recommend that whenever you're not typing,

166
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
then you go into this view mode, which is indicated by this little eye symbol.

167
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,320
Again, it might be up to the right or somewhere up to the left

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,080
to have like the nicely rendered version of this document where you can follow

169
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,000
everything that's happening and only whenever you write a question or add

170
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,360
anything to our polls, you go into the edit mode.

171
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Yes.

172
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,120
So then back to the intro material,

173
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
the practical setup for the workshop.

174
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,360
So we recommend that you create a directory for this workshop on your

175
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,560
computer so that it's easy later to clean up.

176
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
That can be wherever you want to have it.

177
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,080
There will be then some exercise materials in there and so on so that you have it all

178
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,400
in one place and can easily handle or move it around or remove.

179
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
After the workshop, you can put it all into one screen arrangement.

180
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,000
I already talked a little bit about this.

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,440
We have this narrow theater mode for Twitch,

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
so you can also hide the chat and choose this theater mode on your laptop.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,240
And then you can have the lesson notes,

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,080
materials, your terminal or your Visual Studio code or whatever you're using for

185
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,400
the exercises there and watch everything at the same.

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
At the same time.

187
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,120
But on that note, we also are aware that there is a lot of things to follow.

188
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,600
So we have the Twitch stream.

189
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,280
We have the lesson materials.

190
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,560
There might be different things be shown on stream.

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,960
So what we would suggest is that the live stream is the first priority.

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,880
So that's where the teaching is going to happen.

193
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,440
Then the collaborative documents you can use to find info,

194
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,280
like the link to the exercises that are happening right now.

195
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,120
Or when the break ends or this or if whenever you have a questions.

196
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,680
Otherwise, you don't have to follow everything because I said it will be

197
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,040
it will be archived and you will be able to access it also after the workshop.

198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,520
So no worries of missing anything there.

199
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,840
And then the lesson materials web page you can have open and use as needed.

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,080
So the instructors will show most of this on stream, but sometimes it might be nice

201
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,400
to just copy paste something from there or

202
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,200
look look a little bit further up than where the instructors are currently showing on stream.

203
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,280
OK, then.

204
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Some things that can and

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,360
potentially will go wrong in this workshop.

206
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,480
So one very important thing is I hope you can all hear me all right.

207
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,080
If that ever is not the case, because we have many different instructors coming here during

208
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,320
the week, we are trying to have the audio balanced and a good audio quality.

209
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,320
But if that's ever not the case or if there is some screen not visible,

210
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
if you notice an instructor is talking about something that you are not seeing

211
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,560
on the stream, please let us know.

212
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
And the collaborative notes is the way to do that.

213
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,920
So write it in the bottom of the collaborative notes.

214
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,240
If either the quality is bad, too loud, too low

215
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
and

216
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,240
anything like that's happening,

217
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,680
we may deviate from the schedule.

218
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,960
We will try to stay on track as good as we can.

219
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,080
But sometimes things just take a little bit wiser.

220
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,440
Then we'll try to catch up.

221
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,040
The collaborative document may lag a little bit.

222
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,320
I mentioned already then just wait a moment.

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,040
It will probably calm down after a moment.

224
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,920
Suddenly dies.

225
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,400
That might happen when [name]'s computer crashed.

226
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,840
Then it's about five minutes time until it comes back.

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,400
So don't worry. Go have a quick coffee and then we'll resume in about five minutes.

228
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,120
If you have any tool not set up, if you have any issues with the with the tool,

229
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
then don't worry.

230
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,040
You can watch the stream.

231
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,320
And just like follow along or think along and then do the installation after the

232
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,560
workshop and then do the exercises then as well.

233
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,960
So we have a big bunch of installation instructions.

234
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,480
They're also linked from here again.

235
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,640
That's better than trying to fix it on the go.

236
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,440
You can't attend every day. That's also fine.

237
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,880
You can attend only the parts that you are interested in.

238
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,600
The materials are always available.

239
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,000
The videos are always

240
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,680
available so you can catch up.

241
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,760
And also all the lessons in week two, for example, are self-contained.

242
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,960
So you can you can like join whichever session is of interest to you.

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,720
Who is here today?

244
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,480
We have about ten course coordinators, instructors and facilitators for this

245
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,000
workshop, you'll get to know them during the whole of this and next week.

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Many are

247
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
research software engineers.

248
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,480
And if that sounds something that is interesting to you, we'll be talking a

249
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,160
little bit more about that also in the workshop outro on day six.

250
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,080
We have over 350 actually now registered

251
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,960
participants from over 20 different countries, which is very exciting.

252
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,640
And we also have learners from all levels and backgrounds.

253
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,680
And with that also just a word on that.

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
So everyone here is on different

255
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,520
level and that's expected people may come here in the beginning of their Ph.D.

256
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,600
while still studying as a professor or in any kind of

257
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,080
situation that they found out about this workshop.

258
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
And that's fine.

259
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,800
And it's expected and everyone will be learning different things.

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,160
And it's completely fine to just lean back and enjoy the show like you don't have

261
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,200
to do any exercises, this is like up to you, however you learn best.

262
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,800
Everyone can be both a teacher and a learner.

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,080
So if you see a question in the collaborative notes that you can answer,

264
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,560
go ahead and help us answering in many occasions.

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,200
It's also quite interesting to see different opinions.

266
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,720
Big question is always like, what's the best editor, for example?

267
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,240
And if you have an opinion about that, then please chime in to these kind of questions.

268
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,880
And yeah, let us know in the collaborative

269
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,160
document if something isn't going right and if it's a bigger question,

270
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:56,320
a bigger technical issue or something, it's always OK to say that we can discuss later.

271
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,920
In the worst case and if you find there is a problem with someone,

272
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,320
either an instructor or a fellow learner, we have a code of conduct on our web page

273
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,840
and there's also a form where you can let us know about anything that might have

274
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,840
happened there.

275
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,760
OK.

276
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,800
And then final notes from me for today,

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,120
please register if you haven't yet, because then you will get the link

278
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
to the collaborative notes and you can be in contact with the instructors.

279
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,400
You can ask questions

280
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,520
and you will get also all the wrap up emails of each day and the preparation

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,280
instructions for the next day.

282
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,040
And the link is also here to a workshop web page where you can also find the

283
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,600
schedule and the links to all materials.

284
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,640
I mentioned already about the collaborative notes.

285
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,600
If you want a certificate for this workshop,

286
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,840
there are instructions also on our web page.

287
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,240
You can go there and check that out

288
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,560
and follow the instructions there.

289
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,440
And Code Refinery is an open project, so you can join if this is something

290
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,920
that seems very interesting to you.

291
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,960
We always need volunteers and partners to continue with this workshop.

292
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,560
So if after this workshop you're saying, this is so cool and I want to know more

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,840
and I want to want to help with this, you're very welcome to join.

294
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:31,880
We have a whole page called join us where you can find whatever way fits you best.

295
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
And then we also have our support at Code Refinery dot org email address

296
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,840
where you can send any questions regarding the workshop or the project as well.

297
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,600
And as a last thing, we are also on social media,

298
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Mastodon, Blue Sky, LinkedIn, and we are always super happy to read

299
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,360
any experiences from the workshops.

300
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:04,040
And with that, I will give to [name] and [name] starting with the workshop.

301
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,120
Have fun. Bye bye.
