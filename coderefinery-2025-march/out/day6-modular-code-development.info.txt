6.2 Modular Code Development - CodeRefinery 2025 Mar

In this live-coding demo session we take a Python script as starting point which reads data, computes simple statistics, and generates a plot. Together we then improve this code based on suggestions from the audience to arrive at a more reusable code with reusable components. We start in the Jupyter notebook, later move to a Python script/module, introduce testing, and finally introduce and motivate a command line interface to our code.

In this demonstration we use JupyterLab, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, pytest, and Click.  It is also a great demonstration of pair programming.
