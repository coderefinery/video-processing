1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,400
And if you get lost, this is where we are.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,240
So if you visit this link, you will land on the page which I have on the bottom part of my screen.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,220
So I'll just make that a little bit larger here.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,700
And I know that the font size is maybe a little bit too small.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,880
I will zoom in in a second.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,360
I just want to show you an overview of today.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,320
So today we have four episodes planned, really all about collaborating, using Git.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:49,080
And the goal is to give you confidence so that you can confidently collaborate, that you have confidence suggesting changes to repositories, but also that you are comfortable reviewing changes and know how this whole change proposal and review process works.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,080
we have four episodes planned and there will be three exercises today

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:04,600
so we have three exercises each 20-ish minutes where we really test out these different

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,160
collaboration models within the same repository we will practice code review and we will practice

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,140
how to contribute changes to really somebody else's repository

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,460
so before I go into the first episode

14
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,600
let me zoom in here

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,520
to make it easier to read

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,960
the central

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,740
I think the central take home message

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,120
today will be code review

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,180
being able to

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,180
make a change proposal to a repository

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,700
and being able to review it.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,520
The most common scenario,

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,100
and this is what we will practice first,

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,860
will be that we all collaborate

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,960
within the same repository.

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,500
This is a really good fit

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,720
for a research group

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,680
that has maybe three people

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,540
or five people in it

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,100
or 20.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
And then later we will practice

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,520
some other scenario.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,220
And this will be

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,380
exercise-driven. We will practice this

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,220
on GitHub, but everything we show

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,440
works almost the same way also on GitLab.

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,680
Although we will here not demonstrate other services,

38
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,100
even if in your research you use GitLab instead of GitHub,

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,800
it will really work in a very similar way.
