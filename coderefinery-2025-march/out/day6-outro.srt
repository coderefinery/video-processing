1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
okay so the feedback is here you can give feedback not just for today but down below on

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:19,500
every day the whole workshop um i guess we should also save what we show now for uh what's it

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,580
we could just send this video to people who have attended and they can see the

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,180
outdoor even if they're not here right now so we're going on the schedule to the concluding

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,260
remarks here yes and it's also linked from the notes because there will be a lot of links that

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:47,600
we are showing here as well now so that you can just go and click them as well and by the way

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,780
hello everyone in case we haven't met yet i'm [name] i work at csc and starting may i will

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:03,920
be the project manager for Code Refinery. I've been here day four and day one already and will

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,240
now together with [name] go through our concluding remarks. There was a few things we promised already

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,100
in the intro that we will tell you about. So let's see that we get to that. But as the very first

11
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,080
thing, thank you very much to everyone. Thank you to all your participants for all your amazing

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
questions i've been following along a little bit on the side and there have been really good

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,600
questions and i hope they have helped you also in the in the learning process we had some team

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,720
leaders and hosts this time with us so if you joined in a team also say thank you to your team

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,840
leader and to our hosts for doing that and we hope that maybe some of you who are now participating

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,920
as a participant and are interested in helping us with this to join us next time maybe as a team

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,520
leader maybe as a host to learn with others the same is for instructors thank you all that you

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,980
are here still and thanks to also all the instructors of the rest of the week so we had

19
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,320
many different instructors and hopefully that was also valuable to like all the participants that we

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,700
had many different voices, many different ways of teaching so

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,740
that it did not get boring. Then we had some people working in

22
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,160
the behind the scenes answering the questions in the

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,780
collaborative notes. We don't know necessarily who they all

24
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,940
are. We know that [name] answered a lot of them. But then

25
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,700
we also had some people from the participants or from the helpers

26
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,420
answering questions, I believe. And then we have our local partners where they are already covered

27
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:58,540
with the hosts that provided a classroom for week one to learn together. And yeah, you really make

28
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,020
these workshops possible and enjoyable. So thank you, everyone. [name] mentioned already the

29
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,520
feedback so we are really really happy to read all your feedback for today as well as for the

30
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,580
workshop as a whole if you joined the whole workshop and there was for example a lesson

31
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:23,040
that you found completely useless let us know like that's how we that's how we get to know

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,100
if there was a lesson that you really really enjoyed also let us know because that then we

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,240
will probably keep it if we get a lot of feedback in this way and you can do that in the collaborative

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,100
notes you can do that via email to support at codefront.org or you can also join our chat and

35
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,740
this last option is also a very good way to stay in contact with us if you like really enjoyed what

36
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,920
we are doing and want to stay in contact with the instructors stay in contact with other people that

37
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,760
are enjoying um talking and discussing about the topics that we have in this workshop then

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,580
our chat is a really good good way of doing that and everyone can join there is no no like

39
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:18,440
restrictions requirements or anything um then you have seen a lot of different lesson materials

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,540
written by many different people and sometimes last minute updates can make things a little bit

41
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,840
more confusing than they have to be um and sometimes also the way we write it is not

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,560
necessarily how someone who sees it for the first time can understand it so if you had any exercise

43
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,600
or any materials that you were like what what are they talking about this i have no idea what to do

44
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,800
now uh let us know um you have learned in the first week hopefully how to work with github

45
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,800
all our lessons are on github so you can add an issue you can even if you are if you have a lot

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,720
of time on your hands you can send a pull request to update any of our lessons and we'll be happy to

47
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,160
review it and discuss there with you and we are always like using all of these to develop the

48
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,680
workshop materials further so it's very much appreciated and then in the future i don't yet

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,320
know when but i would guess not not any earlier than half a year from now we will also send a

50
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,800
well post post post post post workshop survey um to everyone who visited this and other workshops

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,560
in the past. It's about how you can, how you could make use of what you learned in the workshop. So

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,600
right now there's probably some things that you really enjoyed learning, some things that you

53
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,400
want to apply right away, but in half a year maybe you have a better idea of, oh this was really

54
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,600
useful and I'm using this and that's exactly what we would like to know. And that helps us with like

55
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:09,120
further funding and in general reporting about the project so then we have if you can scroll a little

56
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:20,640
bit down thank you please keep studying and ask for support so um you may have noticed that we

57
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:28,480
have introduced you to a lot of different topics and also in week two we didn't have time to do

58
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,880
exercises as part of this workshop but we would really recommend you if you are if you got

59
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,600
interested in any of these topics to go ahead take another hour or so sit down and do the exercises

60
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,020
most of them have quite detailed solutions also attached to them or step-by-step

61
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,000
instructions on how to go about it but if you get stuck with anything we also have

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,520
what we call a bring your own code session this is also a session where you can bring your own

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,040
question so if you have any questions or anything that you would like to screen share with an

64
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,280
instructor and ask about like is this correct or is this the right way to go about it then these

65
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,880
bring your own code sessions are the best place to come there we will have at least one probably

66
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:29,700
more instructors available and to make it most useful for you and also for us to know how many

67
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:37,260
people are interested in this we have a like a very short registration survey for this it's also

68
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:48,280
linked from the workshop event page schedule just asking I think even just your name and if you want

69
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,020
to you can provide already some information about the things that you would like to discuss

70
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,780
just so that we could invite the correct instructors for that and so far it has been

71
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,160
really fun to go to these sessions and hear about like how you then actually apply what you have

72
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:13,240
learned in the workshops here so it's also interesting for us um yes [name] do you want

73
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,360
to say something about the videos and where they are available yeah so so far i've been able to get

74
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,240
the videos out the same day and probably will today they're on a youtube playlist and well

75
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,560
there you use them for whatever you'd like i guess the main reason we make them is for

76
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,540
the people in the course to review what we said and the examples while you're trying to follow

77
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:48,740
along but maybe they're useful to other people yeah and share them with your friends if you want

78
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,300
and the same with our lesson materials so they are available where you found them so far they

79
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,420
will stay available before the next workshop in autumn they might change slightly but only to the

80
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:11,060
better we hope yeah um we are also working on the notes so okay we are also working on um putting

81
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,560
them on xenodo and we might actually make that happen now during summer for this workshop's

82
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,620
lesson so there you will also then have a pdf version and a like a static thing on the things

83
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,420
you actually learned now in this workshop but yeah the lesson materials on our web pages will

84
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,620
live uh will continue to live on there and you can share them you can reuse them if you

85
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,700
want to teach some of your colleagues about the topics you learned here please reuse the

86
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:50,580
materials they are all under cc by license so you can do that and you can even cite the lessons if

87
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,540
you want to so there is a citation cff file in all of the lesson repositories

88
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:04,900
with all the information you need for for citing them nowadays and then if you go a bit further

89
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:12,260
down yes so i mentioned already you can please do the exercises if you're interested in the topics

90
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,420
and if you cannot come for example to the bring your own code session

91
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:25,540
there is also a lot of local support available for different places here we now have only from

92
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:32,400
our partner organizations for some of our partner organizations the information about trainings

93
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,060
about sessions where you can come to ask for more help like at alto the garage session at cse the

94
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:46,140
weekly user support session and the training calendars but likely your own organization also

95
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,940
has something like this or if not your own organization then maybe your your national

96
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:00,220
high performance computing center or something like this might have help available for for these

97
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,980
kind of questions so please make use of them and if you really don't have anyone you can always

98
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,620
like reach out to us by coming to the chat or sending us an email and we can try to help you

99
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,380
figure these things out.

100
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,780
Okay, if you go a bit further down.

101
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,220
If you want a certificate for this workshop, if you want to get credit,

102
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:35,820
ECTS credit for this workshop, then please go on the course web page. There is on the top

103
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:44,400
middle towards right a tab for certificates there is the instructions on what you need to do and

104
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:53,280
until until when uh yeah deadline is also here 16th of april um then you can get a certificate

105
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,500
but you need to need to do a little bit something for that and that's described there is that

106
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:09,060
basically the learning diaries of each day and output of the exercises is it including the week

107
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:16,340
two exercises or do none of us know because someone else has written that okay i guess

108
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:24,280
someone else is taking care of that i don't know but i assume it's doing the exercises from the

109
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:31,280
second week also yeah i would assume so as well yeah you can read about it in detail actually

110
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,200
now that i'm seeing it here um what you need to do there open it

111
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,960
yeah it's a lot of text so let's not read through that now

112
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,320
but yeah it's a it's a learning diary and then some exercises that you all need to do and alto

113
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,420
has

114
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,500
agreed to go through that

115
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,840
and

116
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,220
provide the certificates.

117
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,000
Our colleague [name]

118
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,300
that you also know

119
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
already from day

120
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
four, I believe.

121
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,380
Okay.

122
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,600
That was certificates.

123
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Then, yes,

124
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,560
code refinery.

125
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,660
We are a project

126
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:26,000
and we need your support please tell everyone about it as if you liked the workshop and I

127
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,680
already mentioned you can like come and help us for the workshops you can also teach with us in

128
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,720
the future if you want to if you're interested in that the best way also there is to come to

129
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,100
our chat and let us know about your interest and then we can figure out how we can do that in the

130
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:51,880
future. We are now in May starting our fourth phase, so we will not cease to exist at least

131
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:00,760
the next three years. But yeah, everyone who is interested in joining us is very welcome to do

132
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:09,740
that. We have social media accounts on Mastodon, Blue Sky and LinkedIn. All three of them have

133
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:16,060
usually the same content linkedin sometimes a bit longer something but in general everything the

134
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,900
same we try to post about workshops and other things that we are doing because besides this

135
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:29,820
workshop we are also collaborating on other workshops like for example python for scientific

136
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:38,460
computing last year we did a nice course on tools and techniques for high performance computing so

137
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:48,780
there's a lot going on and yes the rest i already mentioned you can get involved there's also a

138
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,700
newsletter um that we send i think twice a year the biggest the big newsletter that's usually

139
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:02,060
about like the the big workshops coming up and other possibilities and now i remember that i

140
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:09,340
forgot to put here also we also have an ambassador program so if you are interested in what we're

141
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:19,340
doing and would like to kind of get the latest news more often than half a year then we have

142
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,140
the ambassador program which means like people who are interested in what we're doing who want

143
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:31,420
to re-share about our events and so on but who don't necessarily themselves have the time to

144
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:37,500
get more involved to become an instructor or to host a breakout room or to host a classroom or

145
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,100
to help us in any other way but this like sharing the information wider and also providing us

146
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,620
feedback is very very valuable to us and that's why we started this ambassador program and you

147
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:59,100
can find the link on how to join that also on this newsletter page is it though let's let's check

148
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,060
oh it's actually linking from there okay so it's under join

149
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,580
and i can let's put then the link also on the notes it's under join and for individuals

150
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,020
and there you can find further down code refinery ambassadors that you can find the information

151
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,100
about that if you can put that link on the notes that would be really great okay one of the others

152
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:36,460
who are still here well someone not sharing the screen right now yes exactly okay but now to the

153
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,980
yeah maybe most interesting point of this outro so if you got interested in

154
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:52,380
this research software development or then there's also an association nowadays called the nordic

155
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,820
research software engineers or short nordic rse and [name] do you want to say something about

156
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:05,680
who is in RSE? And what do we do there? Well, we often talk, what is the meaning of a research

157
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,820
software engineer? But basically, it's someone that does research, but cares about the software

158
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:20,240
more than most people, and perhaps wants to be evaluated based on the quality of the code they

159
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,640
write and not just the publications they get. And that's basically all of us here. So we've all

160
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:34,400
studied different types of science things and then we've liked being part of research but we wanted

161
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,320
something a bit more long term and i found good job supporting the software and data and computing

162
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:52,080
side of things and now we're here teaching you so yes and you don't have it you don't need like the

163
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,400
title of research software engineer it's still something fairly new also in the nordics

164
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:05,280
so there's a lot of people who are have titles like postdoc or research assistant or

165
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,800
i don't know what else but many other titles like exist for that and the research software

166
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,020
engineering community is open for everyone who is like interested in the topic who is excited

167
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:23,240
about it learning about it maybe wants to help make it a bit more of a thing also in the nordics

168
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,920
so we have a community once in a while we also arrange seminars and other events we are hanging

169
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:39,340
out in the same chat as code refinery so there is a really tight connection and with our own

170
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,400
channel called nordic rse we have our own linkedin mastodon and blue sky same as code refinery we

171
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,080
post on all of those whenever there is something happening and something happening is actually

172
00:18:51,080 --> 00:19:02,360
quite soon we have our second in-person conference on may 20th and 21st in Gothenburg in Sweden and

173
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:10,360
the general submission deadline is unfortunately already over but we still accept posters and you

174
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,760
can still also join without your own contribution so just to listen on what's going on in the nordics

175
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:23,000
with regard to research software engineering meet some people discuss your situation here

176
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
where there are maybe open positions for research software engineers or research software

177
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,800
engineering interested people and so on and just meet the community and see what's going on

178
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,020
yeah

179
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,600
anything else that we would like to say

180
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,300
at this point

181
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,720
I would want to just

182
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,200
mention

183
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,500
there is now a solution for the plot data

184
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,100
testing

185
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,220
in the collaborative document

186
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,360
awesome, yay

187
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,920
so it's not an unsolvable problem

188
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,940
no, it was

189
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,880
just, yeah

190
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,140
small details

191
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,360
right

192
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,940
okay

193
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,920
but then I think

194
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,780
we are four minutes

195
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,480
before

196
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,040
official closing time

197
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,500
but I guess

198
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,180
that's just good

199
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,500
yeah

200
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,400
thank you very much

201
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,800

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,700
for being so active

205
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,120
