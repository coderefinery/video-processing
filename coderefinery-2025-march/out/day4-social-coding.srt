1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
Hello, and welcome back from the lunch break, everyone.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,740
I hope you had some time to get up, walk around, find some food, maybe some coffee.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,440
We'll be spending now the next one and a half hours on our next lesson called social coding.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,880
And we have already met this morning, but in case we haven't, hi, I'm [name].

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,840
I work as a research software engineer at CSC in Finland.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,900
And with me here today is [name].

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700
Do you want to introduce yourself, [name]?

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,460
Hi.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,660
Well, I'm [name].

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,320
I'm a research software engineer at Aalto University.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,040
And I think that's sufficient.

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,140
Okay.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,520
Yes.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,800
So we'll be talking about social coding and open software or what you can do to get credit for your code and to allow reuse.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:12,320
And this is again, as in the morning as well, a, well, not even demo based, but very discussion heavy section of the material.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:21,240
So there will be no exercises to do directly on your computer, meaning you also don't have any computational prerequisites for this lesson.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,300
So we'll be discussing around the topics and there will be quite some questions for you also coming up in the collaborative notes.

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,460
So maybe, [name], we can show briefly for everyone who joined us now how the notes work.

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:44,760
So you've got the link to the notes with any of the last emails that you got from us if you registered for this event.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,300
And if you go there, it looks something like what [name] is showing right now.

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,460
And then you can see there is already a question being answered here.

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,900
So how would I go about answering this question as well, [name]?

23
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,580
Yeah, so if you have this document open, actually you will probably be at the top if you go

24
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,560
through the link.

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,340
So you can scroll down past the break, past the lunch break, and here is the Social Coding

26
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,840
section.

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,900
And then I have this pen button here that will go to editing mode.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,860
So this is the same document viewed differently, so now I have to go past the lunch section

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,300
again. So now this is the launch section, this info section. And here we have social coding.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:44,800
So yeah, you can read the question and vote for any specific topic or vote for the answer

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,740
by adding a character. So add an O character. I just added one here.

32
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:57,200
if I think it's a good reason to share my script's code or data

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:06,340
if I think that to find and make it easier to find and reproduce is a good answer then I'll

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:14,260
press o here to add one volt and so yeah this is kind of this is nice because you can read

35
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,180
the vote counts

36
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,200
essentially from

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,980
even from this text based editing mode

38
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,080
I'll remove

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,980
my own vote from there. I guess I could go

40
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,740
through them and vote but maybe not yet

41
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,160
I will

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
zoom out though a little bit

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,140
so you

44
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,840
might have this view instead

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,280
where you have these three buttons

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,080
so the edit mode is the pen

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,420
and the eye is the

48
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
view mode

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,500
I guess, preview

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:52,240
should we stay in the preview mode why not yes let's let's stay in the preview and now I will

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:00,660
try to zoom back in and knock out okay okay let's give people still a moment to answer and talk a

52
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,720
little bit about why we have this lesson which might sound a little bit dry maybe to come

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:16,400
to come here and so why do we talk about software licensing and stuff around that so imagine a

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:24,180
situation when you are out there in the internet and you find some really great code or data

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,360
that you really want to use and or reuse for your own purposes for your own research for

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,140
another publication that you might be preparing so you want to do something good for the original

57
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:46,220
author you want to cite them and you will make their work also more visible

58
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:55,960
you might need to modify the code a little bit to make it useful for yourself or if you're using

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,800
like data that you're finding out there you might want to remix it with your own data

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,620
but then everything is nice and you're very happy that you found this code or this data

61
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:17,220
it makes a lot of sense for you to reuse it but then you realize that there is maybe no license

62
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,940
attached to the code and now you really have this situation where you are there okay you have used

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,600
you have done something with it, it solves an issue.

64
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,800
But then no license means you have no idea what the original author allows you

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,020
or agrees with you what you can do with that.

66
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,240
So basically, you cannot reuse what they have provided there.

67
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,000
And then it can be, okay, you choose to publish the paper,

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,720
but you don't publish the software data because you can't meaning also that others that find

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,860
your paper cannot actually build on top of your software on top of your data

70
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:15,000
or you maybe cannot publish it at all because your journal requires that the paper come

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,100
should come with the data and the software so that they are reproducible and this lesson is

72
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:27,620
all about avoiding this situation for you and for others so like if you take something from this

73
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,500
lesson it's about like when you find something on the internet look at it if it has a license and

74
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:46,240
what it allows you to do okay so let's go into the notes and see what we have there so we have

75
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:54,960
four questions to start with the first is about why would i want to share my scripts code and data

76
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,520
and there is a few options that you hopefully had time now to read through and i see that

77
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:12,480
many have already voted here maybe very uh interesting is that age didn't get any votes

78
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:20,640
yet discouraging competitors. So you're all very good sinned here.

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,360
So either it is that people don't believe it discourages competitors or

80
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,200
so it kind of doesn't count as publishing something in the sense that someone else

81
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,480
could still publish it as a scientific contribution. Or it means that people are

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,800
just fine with sharing their stuff and collaborating with people, which would be of

83
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:55,520
course the positive view of this lack of votes. I kind of suspect it is the other one though.

84
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,120
How about you, [name]? What would be a good reason or what is a good reason for you?

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,480
So what am I thinking when I mean, I basically do try to share everything from as early as possible

86
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,980
and originally basically the main reason was that i didn't want to lose access to my code

87
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:23,780
when i moved to another research group so um essentially if you work for a university in

88
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,980
many cases the university owns the license but they do allow you to publish it as an open source

89
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,880
library and then if you move to another university hopefully you brought a copy but even if you did

90
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:44,440
If it doesn't have a license, it's kind of legally dubious to use the code.

91
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:57,940
So you can use it in your new institution if it's a work product, you did it for work, if you publish it with a license, or at least add a license file for yourself.

92
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,320
So that is one big reason.

93
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,220
And then the other one is just if you have it online

94
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,640
and then when your computer crashes, which it will,

95
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,040
then you still have access to it.

96
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,260
For that, of course, it could be private,

97
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,980
but then including the other reason,

98
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,940
not losing access to your own code,

99
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,360
making it public is more useful.

100
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:35,420
um well the third thing is of course it is to actually try to share the research contribution

101
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,120
with so that other people can use it and don't have to redo all the work

102
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:48,940
um so like that is the altruistic reason but the first two are um more about why i'm like

103
00:09:48,940 --> 00:10:01,380
yeah why I'm for myself sharing the code for me it's also here answer K it encourages me to code

104
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:10,240
properly from the start because for myself I'm like oh yeah I will remember and oh yeah like

105
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,360
it's clear to me now what's happening here and I don't need comments I don't need anything

106
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,000
but when i will add documentation at some point and i will add tests at some point and it will be

107
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,620
fine yeah yeah exactly but if you're working up in the open then it's uh it can happen that someone

108
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,000
finds your code and i want to make that someone happy i work that way i want to make other people

109
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,060
happy so i will add a little bit documentation at least and i will also add comments from the start

110
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:48,620
to make that random person that finds my code happy and then again when I come back like two

111
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,040
months after I wrote that code I will also be happy myself to to find the information there

112
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:06,940
okay then let's see question two the most concerning thing for me if I share my software

113
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:14,380
are now so if you're not sharing what's your reason or if you're sharing what are the things

114
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:21,400
that you're concerned about how it is for you yeah it's encouraging that there's a lot of your votes

115
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:30,820
here but yeah I mean actually it is the ugly code answer because if I'm not sharing something it is

116
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,960
because I'm essentially just trying something out

117
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,940
that is probably not going to work.

118
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,500
And then it's abandoned.

119
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,280
I'm not going to finish it, most likely.

120
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,620
Yes.

121
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,940
And so ugly code, definitely.

122
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,240
It's a big reason.

123
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,840
And I have some codes that are still private

124
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:06,240
where i'm thinking like someday i will clean this up for someone else to to use um yeah and

125
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,000
then there is this others may find bugs and mistakes what if the algorithm is wrong

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
yeah what if is the algorithm is wrong if you don't share no one might ever find out that's

127
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,720
maybe good for you because you have that paper published but in the end don't you want to know

128
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,200
like isn't it better if someone says okay like i've looked at your code and um how about this

129
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,020
is there is there some some some mistake here and then you can still fix it and then

130
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:46,320
if you have already published your code then you can publish a what is it addition to

131
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,300
to the paper or in any other way you fix it and then when people reuse it they have a working

132
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,660
code and they actually have something to reuse somehow like this is maybe not always the case

133
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:10,720
but if you have a decent number of publications and some of them have errata some of them have

134
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,000
corrections or you even have um pulled back what was the official what's the correct english word

135
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,260
for removing an article like it's kind of a drastic thing to do usually you would make a

136
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,720
correction but if you retracted an article like that should make you look better that should make

137
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,120
all of the other papers look so much more believable because mistakes happen and yeah I

138
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:46,500
know I've lost some data I know I've changed the code and not been able to reproduce a result and

139
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,640
so on so yeah those kinds of things happen and if your publication history looks like you've never

140
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:02,340
made a mistake like to me that's more suspicious than um than polished look right yes but um that's

141
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,860
um that's not still always the case right it's it is better to make sure that you don't have

142
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,780
mistakes in the paper before you publish it.

143
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,280
For that publishing the code before you publish the paper is

144
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,160
actually a good idea.

145
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:26,360
Yeah. And there is even journals that support that also. And then

146
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,600
we have A, it will be scooped or stolen by someone else. And I

147
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,320
think that's where we get to one of the topics that we will be

148
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,680
talking in this lesson which is licenses can actually help with that because you are sharing

149
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:51,680
your code and depending on like who owns the right is it you or is it your employer you can put

150
00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:00,080
the the license and give the framework on how how your code can be reused in different scenarios

151
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,900
And that's what the license is for.

152
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,520
It's to protect you and your work

153
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,980
and make clear how it can be used in the future.

154
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,440
Yeah.

155
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,280
This is also a big difference

156
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,860
between how software is treated

157
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,340
and how papers are treated.

158
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,300
So when you're doing research

159
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,360
and you publish a paper,

160
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,280
I've never heard anyone say

161
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,320
you shouldn't publish,

162
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,980
I don't want to publish this paper

163
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,860
because then someone might

164
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,520
create derivative work based on it.

165
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
like someone might scoop it

166
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,100
and continue working on that field

167
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,480
because they will cite your paper

168
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,380
and if they don't, that's misconduct.

169
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,820
Now, if they use your code

170
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,260
and they don't cite you,

171
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,660
that's also, I mean,

172
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,740
it's not exactly citing, right?

173
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,240
It's not technically the same thing.

174
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,440
But if they don't mention

175
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,660
that they have used your code,

176
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,380
that is also misconduct.

177
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,440
Unless, of course,

178
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,860
you publish it under a license where you specifically say you can do whatever you want

179
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,360
this code those licenses to exist but you don't have to use that license

180
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:17,200
yeah and then uh point h also has quite a few votes here it is too early i'm just prototyping

181
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,620
and i will write version to this yeah that was my answer also i mentioned also earlier i'm also

182
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:31,480
guilty of that i definitely have some of those lingering around um and there also there is like

183
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:39,280
we all know the the expression um well i don't know the expression like a positive publication

184
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:45,420
bias so just is it just publication bias i guess it is so people publish positive findings and

185
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,340
they do a lot of work on a research project don't get a positive finding and then it doesn't get

186
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:56,260
published then the same thing happens with code you do a bunch of stuff um you try different

187
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,320
things and you never publish the ones that don't work so it actually would be useful to publish

188
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:13,360
the codes where you give up um not necessarily to um to give it to people to reuse but rather to

189
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,820
just tell people you've already tried this maybe they can do it better but you know it's evidence

190
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,640
maybe it doesn't work yeah and it might spark ideas for someone else to continue your work

191
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:34,800
and maybe that is something that in the end also helps you yeah and then we have uh i worried about

192
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:42,160
licensing and legal matters as they are very complicated and yeah i also have felt that way

193
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:51,180
and it is it is a big topic and there is many different licenses and so on but hopefully with

194
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:57,060
this lesson today we can also show you that there are tools out there that help you and

195
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:05,020
like maybe showing you a way on how you can still still do it even though you don't know

196
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,880
the whole context of everything

197
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,060
and still work with

198
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,660
the licenses

199
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,020
there is also just

200
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,200
well and I guess this comes out

201
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,920
in the licensing section as well

202
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,820
but one important point is that

203
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,360
common sense works here

204
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,580
so even though it is a legal thing

205
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,260
it's not just a bunch of magic words

206
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,900
that somehow interact with

207
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,400
some legal system out there

208
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,940
mostly legal stuff is

209
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,980
based on common sense

210
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,980
so if you put a license there

211
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,040
and it's one of the standard ones.

212
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,960
People should roughly know what you mean by it.

213
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,420
So it doesn't have to be complicated.

214
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,140
There's also a comment on,

215
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,860
I put it in Jupyter Notebook format,

216
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,720
which isn't suitable for anyone to reuse it

217
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,020
and never having time to update it.

218
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

219
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,240
Okay.

220
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,660
I mean, we'll come back to publishing notebooks.

221
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,860
So that might be useful.

222
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,840
What do we call that section?

223
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,500
Jupyter Notebooks.

224
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,240
And I guess we have Binder in the Jupyter Notebooks section.

225
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,240
Yep.

226
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,160
Yeah.

227
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,800
So that will be useful in that case.

228
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,700
But yeah, I mean, you can publish Jupyter Notebooks.

229
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,720
You can put them online.

230
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,360
it's not I'm maybe it's not as reusable but it's still it's better than not publishing it

231
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:46,520
yeah and there's even platforms where you can have them as executable notebooks so you don't

232
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,400
even just provide your code but you can provide the whole computing environment

233
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,220
often they live also in containers what we talked about earlier today so that someone could just

234
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,440
go to this platform, click a button to start a whole computing environment with all the libraries

235
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,760
already set up for them and run your code in that environment. So there is definitely ways for doing

236
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:23,040
that too. Yeah. Okay, question three. Why is software often treated differently from papers?

237
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,400
Have you experienced that, [name]?

238
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,560
So, I mean, yes, it's getting better, or at least I think it's getting better.

239
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,480
But I'm also now a research software engineer.

240
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,400
I interact with software way more than when I was a researcher,

241
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,900
although even then I was basically doing the same job.

242
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,020
I was also publishing papers.

243
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,880
and I think that at that time

244
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,660
at least in my field it wasn't even normal to publish your code

245
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,820
and that has at least changed

246
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,580
so it is getting better

247
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,780
I have a feeling there is now more journals that at least suggest

248
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,080
to also publish code and data

249
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,060
some may even require it

250
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,800
but the focus still seems on the papers themselves

251
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:27,220
Yeah. This is partly just an answer or a possible solution to that. Someone will scoop my code

252
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,700
or scoop my research and publish before me. If they were forced to publish the code, then

253
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:42,380
everybody would, of course, see that they have used your code. So in that sense, this

254
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,620
is a root of a of some of these problems

255
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:57,000
and he's also mentioned maintenance isn't funded like just putting it out there is often also not

256
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,720
the end of the line but it's still a good step to do even if you don't have time to maintain it

257
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,620
because like in the previous example it might still spark ideas or someone might find this so

258
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,680
useful that they actually take over the maintenance of your code that can also happen so it can be the

259
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:24,940
end of the line and i have published software that i used for one or two papers never got back to it

260
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,840
and they're just now like i haven't maintained them in five six years and that's like nobody's

261
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,100
losing anything because i don't maintain them if i was still using them i would maintain them and

262
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,860
somebody else has used a part of it then that's nice but yeah i mean you don't lose anything by

263
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:53,620
not maintaining the code that you publish yeah and i think also nowadays i don't know if people

264
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,140
here in the audience have heard about research software engineers before but it's a coming thing

265
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:06,020
to the world let's say in the uk and us maybe already a bit or definitely a bit more known

266
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:13,060
but it's also coming to the nordics now and there is associations like nordic rsc like uk rsc the

267
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,480
society for research software engineering or US RSE and these associations actually

268
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:28,900
like help with this they try to make it more public that like a lot of the research that is

269
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,760
then published in papers relies on the code and that it's an important part of the research

270
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,520
so that researchers also can get credit for that.

271
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
And if that's something you're interested in,

272
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,520
we will have a little bit about this

273
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,540
also in the outro of the workshop on Thursday.

274
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't know how hard should I disagree

275
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
with someone who has written a comment in the notes.

276
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,920
I mean, it's great that you write comments

277
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,220
and I don't want to sound negative or anything,

278
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
but I do want to comment.

279
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,300
So because there is one comment

280
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,340
that essentially says that you need to you don't need to maintain papers and so they are eternal

281
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,060
but you do need to maintain software and um like

282
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:21,700
we we kind of it does seem like that but um if you publish software and never maintain it then

283
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:28,400
it's just like a paper right um then it doesn't change anymore and if when you publish the paper

284
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,420
it just it is frozen in time i guess that is that is the difference that this is pointing at right

285
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,500
um so when you publish a paper it's frozen in time and there's nothing to maintain when you

286
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:45,140
publish a soft piece of software like people do have the expectation that you maintain it

287
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:52,860
but you can also like make it an archive and essentially freeze it and then it doesn't run

288
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,740
anymore. But it is kind of the same thing as publishing an

289
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:03,180
algorithm in a paper. So it's not worse than publishing a

290
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:12,180
paper, in that sense. Yeah, that was kind of an interesting

291
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,380
different point of view. In a way, I feel about this so

292
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,740
differently that it took me a while to understand what it's saying but yeah

293
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,960
it's good to read about the different points of use here yes and thanks for your comment

294
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:41,580
then let's move on to question four when you find a repository with code or library you would like

295
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,960
to reuse what are the things you look at to decide whether to use it how is it for you I don't know

296
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,040
What is the first thing that you're looking at?

297
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,140
The first thing is, when was it last modified?

298
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,480
If it's more than two years, then I might use it for inspiration,

299
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,220
but I'm not going to use the code.

300
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,200
It's unlikely to work.

301
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
The other thing is if it has a license file.

302
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,040
I might not even look at what license it has

303
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,980
as long as it has a license file.

304
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,620
That's the start.

305
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,140
yeah I mean depends on how

306
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,020
restricted if I'm already using

307
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,980
other licenses in the same

308
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,320
same project

309
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,100
same software then you need to make sure

310
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,300
that they're compatible but

311
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,840
if you're just starting

312
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,240
make sure that there's a license

313
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,040
sounds like

314
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,920
you look at

315
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,160
quite specific things

316
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,060
already which are maybe not the first

317
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,220
things that come to mind

318
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:49,140
for a researcher just looking looking at the code I mean it sounds like you have some experience with

319
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:58,460
these things like we have here also how easy it is to use how fit for purpose it is for my project

320
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,880
of course those are also very important things like you don't even have to look at something

321
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,960
if it doesn't seem to fit.

322
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,420
And one way of finding out how fit it is

323
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,920
is to read the readme, read the documentation.

324
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,520
And that is also mentioned as one of the points here.

325
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,140
Is there documentation?

326
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,120
Sometimes there might not be documentation.

327
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,780
There is many projects out there where there's only code

328
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,740
and then maybe some comments in the code.

329
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:37,560
um so that's also a good way of uh where to first look does it have a readme is there

330
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,400
information how do i actually uh get the computing environment up and running

331
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,820
and then also test if that actually works

332
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:55,200
quick overview yes that's what uh the readmes are very good for

333
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,820
and the license yes you also mentioned that already yeah it's good if um so i guess readme

334
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:11,280
is the third thing and this is influenced a lot by what the github user interface looks like

335
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,160
like if you start from the top of the page you first see how old the files are and then you see

336
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,420
if there's a license file and then you see the readme so that's i guess one of the reasons i

337
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:31,460
mentioned them in that order but um but yeah so if the readme actually says that it is doing the

338
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:39,580
thing that you wanted the software to do then it's useful otherwise yeah of course it might not be

339
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:47,720
that useful yeah and it that might also have influence on i don't know if your colleague has

340
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:54,480
been using that code for many years and is happy with how it performs and maybe even the readme is

341
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,640
not that extensive as you would like to have it but you have someone there you can ask questions

342
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:12,860
about that could also be something to consider and if you are thinking about building on top or

343
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:20,140
contributing to the code that you find then also like looking for something like a contribution

344
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:29,760
guide could be good is there a code of conduct and how the violations to it will be handled

345
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:37,740
are there any open poll requests or have they been lingering for years because if you decide

346
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,760
to put some time in contributing to a code you also of course want someone to actually look at

347
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:52,900
your suggestions and potentially merge them so yeah that's a good list that you've been writing

348
00:29:52,900 --> 00:30:00,140
here do you have any other um like often even like seeing a pull request that is open means

349
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:07,600
that someone else has used it and someone else is has found it well useful and is it's clear

350
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,520
enough code that they've been able to modify it which already is a good indication it's a positive

351
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,640
indication even if it has been open for a long time if you look at some of the old codes that

352
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,660
i mentioned that i have published there will be no pull requests there will be no uh no changes

353
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:32,120
in the code for a while and uh you probably shouldn't use those but yeah um but you can

354
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,940
still see if someone finds the paper um and they're curious on how you implemented that

355
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,540
they can still see like how you did that because you shared the code so in that sense it's not

356
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,880
useless out there no it is not it is not useless yeah

357
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:56,820
okay let's go back to the lesson material to the very bottom just one moment and

358
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:04,520
open here yes and are we in social coding yeah in the very bottom

359
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:20,760
Okay. So above this, you can find some more comments about also the questions that we have asked, if you want to reread some of them.

360
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:29,060
this last picture here shows also how our work in general as a researcher connects to the work

361
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:36,340
of others so we have our work here in the middle and we are already looking at other people's stuff

362
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,500
we are looking at their ideas the articles that they have published we might reuse the data or

363
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,540
the software that they have hopefully published and we give them credit we give them acknowledgement

364
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:55,100
of that by citing by citing them or mentioning in the acknowledgements or in what depending on what

365
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,760
you got from them you might find different ways there and then we want to make that also possible

366
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,720
for others that may find our work and that's really what this lesson is all about on how we

367
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,760
can all work together to like not have to always start from scratch okay and software licenses are

368
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,720
one part of that. And with that, I give over to [name].

369
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,160
Okay, so I just clicked next to get to the next section, which is software licensing.

370
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:36,020
So yeah, this is essentially licenses are for telling people that they can use your code

371
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,440
that you have shared, and what they can use it for and under what conditions they can use it for.

372
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,920
so at some point in the past

373
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,480
at least we had a version of this

374
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,140
social coding

375
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,960
section of the

376
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,640
workshop

377
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,400
or social coding lesson

378
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,900
that was called software licensing

379
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,180
but we decided to expand it a good bit

380
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,500
but this is still kind of

381
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,360
something

382
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,340
rather important

383
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,160
that

384
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,640
a lot of the infrastructure for

385
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,960
cooperation is built around

386
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:21,600
so first uh the first point is copyright so whenever you create something you write a piece

387
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:29,860
of code um you have copyright to that code uh and there's a few different related concepts that

388
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:38,600
people get mixed up um so copyright applies to creative work it applies to text that you write

389
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,720
um a painting that you make um i mean if you're in the kitchen because you use the kitchen metaphor

390
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,060
if you create a new recipe and write it down that's um it applies to the way you express the

391
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:58,680
recipe but it doesn't necessarily necessarily apply to the food itself or to the method of

392
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:07,800
cooking it right so a trademark is related concept but it protects the brand name so if you start a

393
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,420
restaurant and have give it a name then that name would be a trademark a patent is for

394
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:22,560
technical inventions so methods of doing things um i don't think algorithms can really be patented

395
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:30,840
but um a specific application of an algorithm or a technical um technical device things like that

396
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,420
um can be patented and then there's copyright so copyright is specifically for creative expression

397
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:42,400
so it's a bit complex i mean there's a lot of these terms it can be a bit complicated and i

398
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,680
guess the main point is not really to remember all the terms right the main point is to get the

399
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:54,200
basic idea that there is copyright that you have copyright to your code when you have written the

400
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,060
code and when someone else has written a piece of code they have copyrighted that code

401
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:09,340
so if you just take someone else's code well that's that's not legal like you you can't just

402
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,060
take it and redistribute it to or make copies of it and distribute it to other people you need some

403
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,640
sort of license copyright also controls derivative work and this is kind of then the

404
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:27,360
this is the important concept here um so derivative work is using someone else's work

405
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,000
and resampling it or creating something from it.

406
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,780
But importantly, it needs to include something

407
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,360
from the original work.

408
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,060
So say this copyright originally is a legal thing

409
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,720
that has been applied to artwork, paintings and books and so on.

410
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,020
So it's much easier maybe to apply there.

411
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,500
So if you take, for example, a piece of music

412
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,260
that someone else has created

413
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,320
and you speed it up

414
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,080
or just remix parts of it

415
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,640
and reorganize it somehow,

416
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,540
that's derivative work.

417
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,760
So you cannot automatically distribute that.

418
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,660
That doesn't automatically become your work

419
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,380
if you are directly using pieces

420
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,420
of someone else's work.

421
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,300
If you paint a painting

422
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,820
that includes a painting,

423
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,040
like you paint a picture of a room

424
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,180
and there's a painting on the wall

425
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,280
and that painting is the Mona Lisa that you painted into the painting.

426
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,240
That's not derivative work, right?

427
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,840
Does that make any sense?

428
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,920
Hopefully it does.

429
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,360
So, yeah, if you're remixing music, it's clearly derivative work.

430
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,040
Copying a paragraph from someone else's book is not just derivative work.

431
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,240
That's actually just direct copying.

432
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,700
But quoting someone else is not derivative work.

433
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,740
so that

434
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,420
there is

435
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:56,840
kind of

436
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,360
a boundary

437
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,920
there that

438
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,340
is

439
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
it is

440
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,640
fluid

441
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,080
in some

442
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,280
way

443
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,380
okay

444
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,080
so

445
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,700
one

446
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,040
important

447
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,540
thing here

448
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:08,780
is

449
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,720
you can

450
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,680
do almost

451
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,200
anything

452
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,860
to someone

453
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,220
else's

454
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,540
creative

455
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,920
work

456
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,720
when you

457
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,040
have it

458
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,280
in your

459
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,680
possession

460
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,180
as long

461
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,480
as you

462
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,720
don't

463
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,100
distribute

464
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,500
it

465
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,000
as long

466
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,200
as you

467
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,580
don't

468
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,440
publish

469
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,760
it

470
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,540
so if

471
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,920
it just

472
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,320
stays in

473
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,500
your

474
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:21,920
home

475
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,320
then

476
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,720
nobody

477
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,540
cares

478
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:33,360
But if you publish it, or if you publish any derivative work that you've created based on it, then you need to think about licensing.

479
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:42,660
Okay, so I don't know how much sense my examples made, so maybe we should actually go through the exercise.

480
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,540
It's already in the notes.

481
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,740
Let's see.

482
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,520
So what do you think, our audience?

483
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,640
What do you think of these is derivative work?

484
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,380
And now it goes towards like our actual coding experience

485
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,340
and situations that you actually might be getting into.

486
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,400
So we have download some code from a website and add onto it.

487
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Download some code and use one of the functions in your code.

488
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,200
Changing code you got from somewhere.

489
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,480
Extending code you got from somewhere.

490
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,000
Completely rewriting code you got from somewhere.

491
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,480
Rewriting to a different programming language, linking to libraries, plug-ins and drivers in your code.

492
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,980
Clean room design, so somebody explains you the code, but you have never actually seen it.

493
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:46,800
And the last one, you read a paper, understand the algorithm and write your own code.

494
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,920
That's awesome, yeah.

495
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,920
So let's give people a moment.

496
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm also at the same time thinking through

497
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,360
if there's any concept that's included in these examples

498
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,580
but I didn't mention, but I don't think so.

499
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,100
So, well, we'll come back to it at the end.

500
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Is there anything you would like to comment

501
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,900
while people read through this?

502
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:29,760
no i think uh so this linked also back to the very beginning when we find out that

503
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,140
what we actually reused didn't have a license on it so we would not be

504
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:44,000
able to actually redistribute it and here also it was still fine that we like reused their code and

505
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,760
everything but then when it comes to publishing that's where we're getting into the into the

506
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,200
trouble yeah so there's some license slightly more slightly complicated or a little bit

507
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,160
complicated things about code in particular where you don't necessarily always even need oops what

508
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:13,760
did i do you don't necessarily always need the code to run the program um so for example if you

509
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,920
write a

510
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,780
written Python libraries in this

511
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,420
or written requirements files

512
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,660
a code can depend

513
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,420
well I mean we just did the

514
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,180
the

515
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,700
recipe for a

516
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,420
container so

517
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,580
the container includes a lot

518
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,280
of

519
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,380
software

520
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,760
you have commands that install system

521
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,980
libraries and install things like

522
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,580
entire

523
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:47,180
probably it installs an entire operating system and then it installs entire programming languages

524
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:54,380
and interpreters for those languages and so on so that is not derivative work

525
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,140
when you just have a dependency and you include the instruction to install that dependency

526
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:10,220
that's not derivative work right um so similar to using numpy in my python yes exactly just because

527
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:18,300
i do import numpy in my python script or import any library in any language script doesn't mean

528
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:25,820
i need to care about the numpy license yeah so okay let's go through this so the first one

529
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,180
download some code from a website and add on to it and i guess we're assuming that we are then

530
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:37,500
publishing the code or at least publishing something derived from the code like scientific

531
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:45,420
research results. So in that case, this is definitely derivative work. You're just taking

532
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,640
someone else's code and use it and make some changes to it. We're just using it, not necessarily,

533
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,460
but making changes to it and publishing those changes is derivative work.

534
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,720
And download some code and use one of the functions in your code. I mean, I guess this

535
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,560
depends on how you do it actually so if you copy the function and put it in your code then it's

536
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,080
definitely derivative work if you call the function and put the name of the library into

537
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:25,280
your requirements file or dependencies files um then it's not uh derivative work right

538
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:35,220
so that actually depends um well okay let's go on changing code you got from somewhere

539
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:42,180
what is this somewhere um yeah i mean just changing the code again not so much but

540
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:48,980
publishing the code using it in in research and publishing the research um yeah that is derivative

541
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:57,220
work. Extending code you got from somewhere. So I guess this means adding a function to

542
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:04,340
the code base. So yeah, I mean this, I would say it's derivative work. I guess you could

543
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,340
extend it by adding a function and then not publish the rest of it, but then it's a dependency.

544
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,940
Okay, completely rewriting the code you got from somewhere. So completely rewriting.

545
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,500
does that mean um so the rest of the examples are kind of well there's some related examples

546
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:37,460
so completely rewriting code doesn't necessarily mean that it's free from copyright

547
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,420
um so like the next one rewriting code to a different programming language so if you

548
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:50,020
essentially do it line by line or function by function you reproduce basically the same

549
00:43:50,020 --> 00:44:01,140
programming and in a different language that is derivative work but then well the clean room

550
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:10,420
design age example so someone describes you how the code works and then you write it in a different

551
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,740
language or even the same language then it is not derivative work because you're just reproducing

552
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:23,380
the algorithm then again if they describe it in to you in too much detail like line by line what

553
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:29,060
does this line in the code do um you are actually pretty much getting to derivative work again

554
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,900
okay so that it depends on on what level the rewrite is but if you're just doing the same

555
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,420
interface but otherwise completely like doing it from scratch yourself is not derivative work

556
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,820
if you are rewriting it function by function then it is derivative work

557
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,420
so i skipped over linking to library static or dynamic plugins and drivers

558
00:44:52,020 --> 00:45:01,700
um so i said that um having a dependency is not derivative work but actually um if you are

559
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:08,340
statically linking and then distributing the binary that is derivative work at least to some

560
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:16,180
extent like there are licenses that specifically are about being able to link to it as a library

561
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:27,220
or not being able to do that so it does count as derivative work um but if it's a dynamic library

562
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:34,580
you're linking dynamically then it is not derivative work so yeah i mean it gets

563
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,700
it does get technical at this point um

564
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,700
uh okay someone is saying i'm contradicting the solution which is great um

565
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:59,020
So, yeah, so you read the paper, understand the algorithm, write your own code.

566
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,440
So that is not derivative work.

567
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,760
Yeah, so maybe I was giving a bit too much detail and I should actually look at the solutions just to see.

568
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,640
So, yeah, derivative work is A through F.

569
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,060
It's not, is derivative work, so that's pretty clear.

570
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,140
Except I gave a lot, way too much details.

571
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:27,500
about situations where it might not be then g and i are derivative work or not derivative work that

572
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:35,800
is so statically linking to a library it is right it is considered derivative work

573
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:44,860
sorry in general it's also and someone wrote it here also in the later comment in the notes

574
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:54,080
that it's somehow realistic that you get different answers on who you ask yeah yeah um maybe our

575
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:01,000
questions or our statements here are also not clear enough to give this clear answer because

576
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,100
what you explained like in this static versus dynamic libraries and if you uh like share the

577
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:14,100
binaries uh or the source code that makes a difference and that's why it's like important to

578
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:20,660
like have a little bit of an overview now so that when you are in this situation you at least know

579
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:25,280
where to look and know where you can find information about the different licenses what

580
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:34,660
they are actually like are talking about but yeah maybe for the future we could look at

581
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:42,540
making the statements less ambiguous or then have a little bit more information in the solutions

582
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:53,140
yeah or i think this is also um these are more discussion points i guess i think like having

583
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,620
even having a solution there may not be maybe we should just make the solution more ambiguous

584
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:05,140
um maybe it should not be called solution but uh things to note or yeah take home messages

585
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:11,420
that's a good point okay well but yeah so we also shouldn't get should not get bogged down

586
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:18,740
the details in which case i'm the wrong person to be doing this but um the so the big picture is

587
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:26,200
that you should always look for a license and then you should basically do what other people

588
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,880
do in the same situation which is if you're using a python library you add it in the requirements

589
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,900
file you don't need to think about the license people don't think about the license if you're

590
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:43,260
creating a container and you essentially have the entire Linux operating system in there,

591
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,620
you still don't need to think about the license and you never see people talking about the Linux

592
00:48:49,620 --> 00:49:00,160
license in there. But then if you are actually taking code from someone else, even if you are

593
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,100
rewriting it, you probably should think about the license. Technically, there are situations where

594
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,260
don't have to but it's still maybe better to just like take the license into account.

595
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,780
So yeah that is yeah that should probably be the more big picture answer.

596
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:23,260
So and on a kind of related note I already actually mentioned all this so

597
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,020
so now related notes here's a big list of different licenses and it's not really useful

598
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:40,460
to know all of the possible licenses that exist but there is a general sort of um grouping of

599
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:49,240
licenses starting from the bottom there's public domain licenses which basically say do whatever

600
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:54,980
you want with my code and you don't need to even mention where you got it so

601
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:01,500
So this is what you include when you just, like, I don't know,

602
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,300
when you don't care that much, basically, right?

603
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:11,060
And then there's licenses with a bit more restrictions.

604
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,060
So proprietary licenses are their own thing.

605
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,320
We don't really have examples of them,

606
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,760
but it essentially means you're not allowed to use it.

607
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,760
It's a commercial thing, and somebody owns it.

608
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,800
There might be some conditions where you actually can use it

609
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,820
and you have to kind of then go and understand

610
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,320
what it is that they're doing.

611
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,660
So if you're buying something from someone else, sorry?

612
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,560
Yeah, or you can buy licenses.

613
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:38,820
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,960
So if you're buying something like a license to MATLAB,

615
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,460
you are getting a proprietary license to use MATLAB, right?

616
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,120
But then on the right, you have open source licenses

617
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,920
and there's the more permissive ones.

618
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:03,060
the bottom um it's less conditions but usually they're in the open source section um they do

619
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,260
have the condition that you should tell people where you got the code or who did the work

620
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:15,140
so you should give attribution so kind of like if you know cc by for data um

621
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:23,460
it essentially so the buy here means um you need to have a sentence that says this was made by

622
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:30,660
this person right essentially citing essentially attribution and then you have we can go all the

623
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:37,300
way to strong copy left which means any derivative work has to be also open source it has to be under

624
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,820
a an equally restrictive license and here because i just because i mentioned libraries there is like

625
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:49,940
this library uh we copyleft licenses where you can use the library but you can't so you can use

626
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:59,220
the library in like a more permissive way but you um so if you link to it but then um

627
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,820
it's less permissive about using the code directly

628
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,860
so you don't need to know all of these but there is this important thing that where the arrows

629
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:17,940
are pointing so public domain you can use anywhere this let more permissive ones you can even use in

630
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:26,020
proprietary codes, but you need to tell people where you got it from. And then the more you go

631
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:34,060
to the copy left side, the more restrictive it is. So you cannot always code down. You cannot

632
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:39,800
use a more permissive license if you have included code from a less permissive one.

633
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,460
Yeah, that's where it's important that you look at the license early on,

634
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,480
because the license of a code that you are using

635
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,940
together with your own code

636
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,540
might define which licenses you can actually use yourself

637
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,300
for your own code also.

638
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,760
So one thing I want to mention or show

639
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,600
is this join up licensing assistant.

640
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:12,840
I should not have closed the original page.

641
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,080
Okay.

642
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,660
let's choose this one for now so yeah this is a

643
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:27,380
a tool created by i think european union funding it's it includes a big list of licenses

644
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:34,420
and has a nice description of like you can get quick at the glance see what you can do what you

645
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:42,180
must do what you cannot do and what it's compatible with you can search for a specific license if you

646
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:51,620
see it so with mit you can you do a lot of things you must include the copyright and tell people

647
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:58,740
who made it include license you cannot hold the person liable for writing the code it is

648
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:06,980
compatible with almost anything and um well interpretation of law is uh i guess something

649
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:13,640
you need to look at if you are interested and then it is supported well so people understand

650
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,420
what's going on if you use this license and I guess this is an important point by the way

651
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:24,980
so you should in general use a license that you didn't write yourself a license that people know

652
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,620
so that they understand what's going on so if you write your own license

653
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:35,720
no matter how clear the legal lease is there's going to be a lawyer somewhere who thinks it's

654
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:44,300
too big a risk to use so you should use a license that people already know so MIT is

655
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:51,960
well-known licensed as GPL is a well-known license and so on and this well-known license also you

656
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,740
might have encountered them in github for example it shows it quite nicely then on the top what you

657
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,500
can do and what you have to do with them. Yeah.

658
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:07,160
So this is helpful for choosing a license, especially when you

659
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,860
already have are using some work that are that is under a

660
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:15,500
license. We should soon move to a break.

661
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,680
I think we can have five minutes more here. Yeah, go to a break.

662
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,420
And so we already mentioned the licensing assistant.

663
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,020
But when should I add a license?

664
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,280
Yeah, I think we already answered this question, but let's answer it again.

665
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,400
So when do you, when you start a new project and you start working on some code, when do you add a license?

666
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,400
Well, nowadays, I do it as the very first thing.

667
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:54,920
I either if it's myself only I do that as the very first thing or if it's together with others

668
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:00,120
to discuss it also very early like what kind of license we want to put that under because then

669
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:06,040
you don't have to think back or contact old collaborators that might not be working where

670
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:12,920
they did before anymore or like figure out the whole bureaucracy behind it so you can start

671
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:22,040
start early on and have the terms clear so yeah one important point is you can add license even

672
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:27,480
if the code is private so adding a license doesn't make it public because you haven't put it anywhere

673
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:34,200
so necessarily publicly so yeah you can you can even start adding the license when um

674
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:42,600
when the code is still like not published anywhere when you're just working privately alone

675
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:50,440
or with someone but especially when there's a second person working on it then the ownership

676
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,540
becomes complicated so if you then want to add a license you need to ask everyone who has

677
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:01,660
contributed to the code unless you already have a license and then you the license tells you what

678
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:08,940
you can do so at least like add a license before you publish it add a license before a second person

679
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,880
works in the code. But preferably, I would just add it immediately.

680
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:20,440
And related to that, where do you add a license or how? Like, how do you tell people what's

681
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,300
the license of the code?

682
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:28,960
So the suggestion here is good. What I actually do is I add a single file called license.txt.

683
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:36,940
But that works as long as you only have one license in the software. If you have a mix

684
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:44,640
of licenses, you're using things from multiple different sources, then it is a good idea

685
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:52,740
to have a licenses folder in the root of your project directory, so your Git repository.

686
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,920
And then you add the license files there.

687
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:05,200
So it may still be just one file, or it may be a couple of files that apply to different

688
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,420
parts of the code.

689
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:14,180
so especially if you have code and you have data you may need or may want to use different licenses

690
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:24,800
for the code and the data for example yep okay i think we should slowly move into the break

691
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:34,140
but there is uh if you scroll down a bit a very long list of a lot of great resources on the topic

692
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:43,460
So as you noticed, it is a topic where there can be like these different opinions about things, depending on who you ask.

693
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:54,540
It can completely change something if you change one word in the sentence, like how that relates to the licenses or if it's derivative work or not.

694
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:03,140
So if you're interested in the topic, look through here and maybe you can find something that works for you.

695
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,800
There's also multiple tools like the JoinUp Licensing Assistant.

696
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,060
But yeah, for the key point, [name], what should people take from this lesson?

697
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,680
Well, you should have a license for your software.

698
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,560
I think a license late can get complicated.

699
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,800
It's good to have it as early as possible.

700
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,620
if you're unsure

701
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,100
I would say

702
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,220
do what other people do

703
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,380
ask your colleagues

704
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,940
what license should you use

705
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,240
and

706
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,920
if you actually have to make the decision

707
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,980
then look at the license selector

708
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,000
and decide

709
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,320
what you think is good

710
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,740
but yeah in general

711
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:51,240
having any of these licenses is good

712
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,940
yeah remember

713
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,960
that if you don't have a license even if you

714
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:03,140
put your code out there the default is that no one can like make copies or build onto it which is

715
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:10,760
what science is about so it's good to keep that in mind and also you might actually have an employer

716
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,500
who tells you which license to use for your code so you don't actually have to worry about it because

717
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:22,200
your employer might either in the contract or in some other papers tell you if you do code always

718
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:30,280
use this license so also check that out and now let's go into oh sorry oh well i'm just your

719
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:38,120
employer is also an owner of the code so you always have two owners actually and um you may

720
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:44,620
have to ask them if uh things go on for too long without a license so it's better yeah just to put

721
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:51,020
it as have a license as early as possible and have that conversation early yeah yeah okay the

722
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:58,720
conversation with everybody who's involved 10 minutes break until 11 past the hour and then

723
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,500
we'll get back with software citation and a little bit about sharing data and then the feedback for

724
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,200
today see you in 10 minutes bye see you bye

725
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:24,260
Okay we are back from the break and we have some 20 minutes left for today and with this we will

726
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,140
go a little bit into software citation and sharing data.

727
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:34,040
So, [name], could you switch the screen share to the software citation?

728
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:40,480
Yes. So this is the front page and we are at the software citation section.

729
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:47,300
Exactly. So as you can see here on this big picture, we are also looking at the FAIR principles.

730
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,680
And maybe you have heard about them already.

731
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:55,380
FAIR stands here for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

732
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:03,860
And it comes across, or researchers may stumble across it a lot when talking about data.

733
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,060
But it also actually applies to software.

734
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:18,240
And here in the beginning, we have the question, is putting software on GitHub or GitLab actually publishing?

735
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:23,900
Does it actually help with making the code findable and accessible?

736
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:30,400
and we have mentioned it's a very good step to do that it's a very good step to

737
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:38,980
publish your code on github to have everyone be able to find it but what happens if github is not

738
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:45,480
around anymore in the future or what happens if someone decides to delete your code from there

739
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:53,640
then there is no trace of it there's nothing that you can link to and therefore it's also

740
01:02:53,640 --> 01:03:00,440
important to not only put it on github but once you're done or in one of the states of done with

741
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:08,520
your code for example when you publish a paper that relates to the code also publish publish

742
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:14,140
the code and make it citable and persistent and that means for example getting a persistent

743
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:22,260
identifier such a doi which you might also know from manuscripts for your code and services like

744
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:29,340
Zenodo can give you that and there's also multiple like national services that might provide you

745
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:36,840
with a DOI for your code and then we're also if you scroll down a little bit we're also talking

746
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:44,380
about making your software citable so we already talked about that software is on a bit different

747
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:51,800
level than papers for the academic merit but if you want people to cite it you also need to make

748
01:03:51,800 --> 01:04:00,000
it possible for them to cite it and one way of doing this is adding a so-called citation cff

749
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,960
file which we can see here an example of nowadays even github supports this so if you add a citation

750
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,460
cff file to your github repository it may already suggest like what kind of data should be in there

751
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:26,300
and it also if a code has a citation cff file you can download for example the bib text citation

752
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:36,040
for for that code and there's also a little bit further up sorry we're jumping around a little bit

753
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:42,400
there yeah the checklist for making a release of your software citable and release here meaning

754
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:51,860
we are in a state that this is now a done thing for now it does not have to be like everything

755
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:58,140
done but it is something that you have used to create your research outputs for example

756
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:06,020
it is in a state yeah so this is something like version 1.0 version 1.1 and so on or 0.1 or

757
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:11,880
and so on exactly when you feel comfortable it does some it does what you want it to do

758
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,900
in a certain way and there might be still open issues there might be still

759
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:22,660
things you want to fix but it's still it's already usable so what you can check is

760
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:26,120
we talked about license so how do you have a license assigned

761
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:37,800
um do you have some metadata for your software for example in a readme or in the citation file

762
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:45,280
format for example um do you have a clear version number like you can start with 0.1 you can start

763
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:52,260
with 1.0 um depends on what you want to say with that and it might say also there are different

764
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:59,740
things to different people? Are all the authors credited? Do you have all the contributors

765
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:07,700
mentioned somewhere? Did you get a persistent identifier from tools like from services like

766
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:14,540
Zenodo? And then also the last thing, add a recommended citation. So in this case, you also

767
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:20,820
then have a little bit of this influence on how other people may cite your software so that they

768
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:25,820
don't have to worry, oh, I found this nice code here, they have a

769
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,380
paper about it, they have the citation for, I don't know, the

770
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:34,380
data set they're used. But if you actually want people to cite

771
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,800
your software, then it's good to give them the information that

772
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:47,040
they need to do that properly. And in the very bottom of this

773
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:55,640
document there is also the information that if you cite other people what kind of

774
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:03,700
information is good to cite and there is some resources also in the blue box have you cited

775
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:12,600
any software yeah no in papers yeah um i mean again it's a part of the job so

776
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:21,480
um if i'm participating in writing a paper and then it's probably related to some software that

777
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:33,000
i wrote but um in general also before that we would cite software but there was no specific

778
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,960
standard and i don't think it was really counted anywhere or like it was basically a link for

779
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,340
people to find the software if it was online at that point. But

780
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,360
so yeah, this is like, this is a pretty high standard, but it is

781
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:55,420
also good. Good to have this sort of checklist and like, a

782
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,680
recommended right way of doing it so that

783
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,300
yeah, people for us. Yeah, and for us as authors, it's fairly

784
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,180
straightforward to write this file. If someone else would need

785
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:11,420
to find and pick already, I don't know, sometimes the

786
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:15,740
author's name might be hard to find. So like, the easier you

787
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,560
make it for people, the more likely it is that they actually

788
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:27,760
cite your site, your software. And yeah, I think like linking,

789
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:31,700
like you mentioned, having having a link to the web page of

790
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:37,000
a tool or something is already a good first step. But yeah, the

791
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,140
more you can put there also in citing other people's work, the

792
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:47,340
better, the easier it is to for those to find the right version

793
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:55,720
that you also used. For example. Okay, then, let's move on to

794
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:03,680
sharing data. And we mentioned already in the beginning that we

795
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:13,680
not go too deep into this right now this is more of a collection for you of places where you can

796
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:23,840
share data and some of them also integrate for example with github and are also used for sharing

797
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:33,120
code so you can go through the list and see what either fits you sometimes you may want to keep it

798
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,280
in the country that you are working in. Sometimes you may want to choose a more international forum

799
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:50,080
or sometimes there's also a domain specific forum where the likelihood of someone randomly finding

800
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:56,560
your data is higher because people that go there already are looking for something in your domain.

801
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:05,040
so this is really something where you can then decide um where you want to where you want to

802
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:11,920
publish it and a really good resource here is what's linked in the very top this re3 data

803
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:22,320
so there you can find a ginormous list of of all kinds of forums so we've just picked a few here

804
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,100
and put a few also national ones.

805
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,100
And if we have people here who know about some forums,

806
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:35,860
for example, in, what do we don't have, Germany or other places,

807
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,260
then please let us know so that we can add them here.

808
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,320
Where do you usually publish your data, Jonna?

809
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,480
In Zenodo, basically.

810
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,420
That's essentially the first option.

811
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,900
Of course, it does have a size limit.

812
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:56,980
So if you are in a domain where the amount of data is large, that doesn't work.

813
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:02,920
But then, yeah, I guess the more domain-specific,

814
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,280
so it is kind of the same as in publishing papers.

815
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:11,460
The more general use it is, the more public you want to make it,

816
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:17,520
and the more specialized it is to a field,

817
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:24,140
the more you want to find a specific place for that field.

818
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:25,400
Yeah.

819
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:32,400
And also here, it's important that you have a license attached to your data

820
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,480
so that everyone knows under what terms they can reuse your data.

821
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,900
There's also specific licenses for databases.

822
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:44,960
And then there's also some information

823
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:53,700
in the more towards the bottom of this page about licensing and ai and there might be coming an

824
01:11:53,700 --> 01:12:01,940
update to this page um very soon so keep an eye on it and then also in the further reading list

825
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:10,040
we put again we mentioned it many times already the touring way oh yeah yeah but i'm at this

826
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:17,600
program okay sorry so the touring way uh there is a lot of resources there about everything that

827
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:27,000
we talked about today in both lessons and then also multiple papers and guidelines for fair

828
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,740
software and data as well as well as for example a software quality checklist

829
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:45,240
list. And with that, I think we can take a look at the notes. I didn't see now any questions.

830
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,300
No, no questions. So there is the feedback section then.

831
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:57,540
Exactly. We leave some time now for you to provide feedback about today, both sessions

832
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,320
or whichever session you attended?

833
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:06,380
Was it too fast, too slow, too advanced, too basic?

834
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:10,360
Do you think you will use what you learned today?

835
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,480
Were there things that you really liked?

836
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,480
Were there things that we should definitely

837
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,060
work on a little bit more before we do

838
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,700
the next iteration of this workshop?

839
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,300
And if you have any other feedback,

840
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,940
we are very happy to hear about this,

841
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,900
because we will continue these workshops

842
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,380
and we always thrive to improve

843
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,900
or try to improve based on your feedback.

844
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,940
So this is very important for us.

845
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,040
And you can also continue asking questions

846
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,080
in the very bottom with that.

847
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,340
So, yeah.

848
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,680
Yeah, I don't have anything more to bring up.

849
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,800
Anything else or...

850
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:59,960
I'll just keep an eye on any more questions for a few minutes.

851
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:06,760
Yeah, and now I was so worried about not having the time for the feedback

852
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,660
that we are now done five minutes earlier, but I guess that is okay.

853
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,960
Sorry for running through the software citation part,

854
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:23,240
but also that is something like check out this citation CFF file, for example,

855
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:27,500
and see how it's how it can be used especially within github and

856
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:46,780
when i guess you were also a researcher before you became a research software engineer

857
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:54,800
Were the topics of today, were they something that you have thought about in your daily life?

858
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,280
You mean as a researcher?

859
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,020
Yeah, as a researcher.

860
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,320
So they did come up for kind of standard reasons.

861
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,700
I mean, it was a while ago.

862
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,960
And like I mentioned, sharing the code was not normal when I started.

863
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:17,200
so there was this standard argument that if you share your code then the other people will use it

864
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:26,160
to reduce the results before you get there which is because i was also in a field that well i mean

865
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:34,160
i was doing high performance computing on really big clusters so it was like after the fact that

866
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:39,560
now that i think about it it seems like a weird argument because there were like three people in

867
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,220
the world who had the resources to do to um to run that experiment and they had other things to do

868
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:49,160
so it wasn't really a great argument but but you know that that was the world then

869
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:58,840
um so there were situations where either the code changed or just like the machine changed and it

870
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:05,380
didn't reproduce exactly the same result as before and due to the nature of of statistics works

871
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:15,480
sometimes um you wouldn't get quite the same headline results right so um like i was thinking

872
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:23,000
about this a few times and in the end we did start publishing the code but at that point i had

873
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:30,420
already essentially left um left the field and became a research software engineer so like i

874
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:38,500
happy to see people publish the codes that I had worked on, but it never happened while I was working on them.

875
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:51,700
I don't think software citations ever came up. We did cite software in the sense of

876
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:58,900
giving a link in the citation section of the paper, but it wasn't for credit, it was for convenience.

877
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:07,220
And so, yeah, I mean, things have changed quite a bit since then,

878
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,460
or at least I have the impression that they have.

879
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,420
Although it's been, what has it been, like eight years

880
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,980
since I was a proper researcher?

881
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:23,520
I say proper researcher because I have had a researcher title since then,

882
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,400
but I wasn't actually a researcher.

883
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,920
I was actually, I guess, a software engineer for the research team.

884
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:33,800
But yeah.

885
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:49,160
So, I mean, yeah, these would have prevented several issues.

886
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:58,060
and i have like i i think a few even few disagreements between research teams

887
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:03,600
would have been solved if they had published their codes like we would have known why the

888
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:10,480
results are different um because it seems like they were just doing different things

889
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:15,980
and thinking they were doing the same things so yeah stuff like that it was not just reproducibility

890
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:23,580
but just actually like interpretability of the results can depend on actually publishing the code.

891
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,220
I don't know, can you scroll down the notes?

892
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,440
Yes.

893
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:35,100
So we have people filling in there. Thank you very much. Please keep it coming.

894
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:42,060
Seems overall, we had the right speed a little bit too fast, maybe

895
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:53,600
be right level. People will use what they learned today. Licensing discussion. Oh, glad

896
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:00,860
that you also got something out from the snake make episode. Yeah, please also check all

897
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:06,660
the exercises that we have there. We try to put always the solutions there so that you

898
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:09,440
can run through them by yourself.

899
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,220
And then we have to bring your own code sessions

900
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:17,460
for asking more questions about these things.

901
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,600
And sorry to hear that sometimes the audio did not

902
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,960
go through very well.

903
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,720
And the Python, yes.

904
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,720
It's been difficult to follow as a non-Python user.

905
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,080
That's something also we're still trying to figure out.

906
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:49,200
I think it has gotten better over the years by adding, at least for self-learning, the different tabs of the different languages.

907
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,500
And you will see more of them also during the next days.

908
01:19:52,840 --> 01:20:00,080
But Python is still our go-to example language for many things.

909
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,900
but it's understandable that now

910
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,480
that we are only demoing the examples

911
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,660
and that as a non-Python user,

912
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,960
it might take a bit longer to get behind

913
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,700
what's actually happening.

914
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,140
Sorry for that.

915
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,400
But yeah, we're over the time already.

916
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,840
So maybe we wrap up here.

917
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,820
We'll still leave the notes open

918
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,280
for you to add more feedback.

919
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,480
I'll say thank you, [name], for teaching today.

920
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:40,120
And we'll see everyone else tomorrow again.

921
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:41,720
What comes up tomorrow?

922
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,460
It is Jupiter and documentation lesson.

923
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,760
And I think you are part of the teaching.

924
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,980
Yeah, I will be there.

925
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:51,500
Tomorrow as well.

926
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:52,600
Yes.

927
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:53,360
Okay.

928
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,640
So bye from me for now.

929
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,120
I think I'll be back on Thursday afternoon.

930
01:20:59,080 --> 01:20:59,960
[name] will be back.

931
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,920
tomorrow yeah thanks uh everyone and yeah see you tomorrow bye thank you bye
