5.1 Documentation - CodeRefinery 2025 Mar

In this lesson we discuss different solutions for implementing and deploying code documentation. We start by creating a wishlist for how we would code documentation like to be. Then after a tour of available tools, we discuss how to write useful and accessible READMEs, and then we progress by demonstrating and practicing the Sphinx documentation generator and demonstrate how to deploy documentation to Github Pages.

Topics and tools discussed: Markdown, reStructured text, README documentation, table of contents generation, Sphinx, Read the Docs, GitHub/GitLab pages.
