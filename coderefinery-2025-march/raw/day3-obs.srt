1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,620
you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,620
you

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,620
you

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,620
you

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,620
you

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,620
you

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,620
you

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,620
you

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,620
you

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,620
you

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,620
you

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,620
you

14
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,620
you

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,620
you

16
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,620
you

17
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,620
you

18
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:55,000
hello let's see are we live things look okay

19
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:07,560
good morning or afternoon yeah so let's scroll down and see what we've got today

20
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:16,080
so if you're just joining this is the notes we have that registered participants will have in

21
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,380
their messages in their emails if you scroll down you can switch to edit mode and we have

22
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,140
some icebreakers i guess you can see what people do here

23
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,100
so the first question if you can ask for any superpower perhaps computer related

24
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:42,900
what would you ask for next in preparation for the day um unless you're doing something

25
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,860
else have you opened this access request and i guess this can be a yes no question

26
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:58,820
this was just for us

27
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,400
a nice sneaky way to remind people

28
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,680
that this exists

29
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,080
this is something we will use later

30
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,480
so we will today collaborate

31
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,620
and if you are not part of a team

32
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,840
or not part of a classroom

33
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,460
then you can join

34
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,880
you can join this

35
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,220
but then you need to do two clicks

36
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,360
it's two mouse clicks for you

37
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:29,560
yeah yeah and then we have a third question which is how do you collaborate with others on code

38
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,140
it could be git related but doesn't have to be git related

39
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,600
so i i wrote that question because i'm just really interested in the answers so there are

40
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,660
no wrong answers here yeah it could be email or it could be

41
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:51,620
i mean i actually remember when people were putting things putting code on a on a plastic

42
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,880
floppy disk traveling to some other place and then combining their work and then traveling home again

43
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:06,620
yeah so what about for you all what's super or maybe we should introduce people so i've been

44
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,740
here previous days. So maybe you know me, I'm [name]. And with me here is [name]. Would you

45
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,700
like to introduce yourself a little bit? Yeah. Hello. Welcome, everyone. My name is [name]

46
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,480
[name]. I work at University of Bergen. My primary role is the training coordinator at

47
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,400
Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services. It's called NRIS. I'm so happy to be here.

48
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,440
And welcome to all of you. I hope you will have a great time today. Thank you.

49
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:48,020
Yeah, hi everybody. So [name]. I work in TromsÃ¸, northern Norway. Really being

50
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,000
part of Code Refinery, teaching Code Refinery is one of my favorite things. So I was really

51
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,720
looking forward to this day and to teach today with [name] this topic that I really care about

52
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:08,280
lot so in my job i do actually now two things uh four days a week i work in a startup as a

53
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:14,600
programmer scientist and then one day a week i do these kind of things so teaching and

54
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,840
helping researchers with the code development

55
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,320
really looking forward to this so i'm also thinking all the time what is

56
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,520
what what superpower i would i would take if i could um i think i need to think a little bit

57
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:39,520
more do you have an answer i like so i don't know if this is a good answer but often i think

58
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:47,000
the again this has any superpower not trivial superpower but like short-range teleportation

59
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,640
like across small barriers and things like that um but there's probably something could be useful

60
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,720
like going to conferences and meetings just teleporting being there for a meeting coming back

61
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,920
well i was thinking much more short range like a few meters or tens of meters but

62
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,920
still being able to move around more quickly would be quite cool

63
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah, I think time travel would be cool. But just also like very limited. That's maybe

64
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,900
maybe like a more trivial

65
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,420
superpower

66
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,820
yeah

67
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:59,400
yeah

68
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,100
and [name] any ideas

69
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,540
I

70
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,760
remember I had this

71
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
question answered a couple of years

72
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
ago and it is still

73
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,000
the same I wonder if I have

74
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,700
the superpower I would like to

75
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,540
change all this distress around the world

76
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,020
or the sickness, all this

77
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,160
what is going on around

78
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,400
so maybe that's

79
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,880
I really want to

80
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,300
if I could have

81
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:43,240
but already

82
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,080
small steps help

83
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:53,600
and I'm really looking forward today to discuss collaboration we will continue we will really

84
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,600
take the version control that we discussed on day one and day two we will take it to the next level

85
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,400
oh there are a couple of building blocks that we will see again

86
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,640
and we will combine them and be really use them to collaborate on on projects together

87
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,180
yeah so the big topic today is collaboration and we will then discuss different

88
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,740
models of collaborating through through version control git through services like github

89
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:33,940
yeah this is where we really see it become useful so what we've learned so far i mean yeah you can

90
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,100
sort of get by without this but if you start having multiple people working on something

91
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:48,300
what you do today transforms your possibilities from stuff being impossible to very possible

92
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:57,100
and really the idea of the pull request based workflow has probably contributed to

93
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,380
a lot of the open source and scientific software development we have now so yeah

94
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,900
and just also based on the answers here of from the icebreaker there i'm sure there are

95
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:18,180
participants in the workshop who don't work yet with others on the code but i'm still convinced

96
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:25,820
that this will be useful because it will also we will show how to how to suggest changes to

97
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:33,440
maybe a program that you are using in your work even if you work alone or how to if ever you like

98
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,260
if you publish a software project and somebody else reuses it,

99
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,640
somebody else makes changes that you know how to process them,

100
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
how to give feedback.

101
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,120
So I'm really convinced that what we show will be useful also

102
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,740
for projects where you are working on your own.

103
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,540
But hopefully in future you can work with others.

104
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,040
Should I start taking the screenshots as if we are ready?

105
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,700
Sure, yeah.

106
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,720
We'll do that. Go ahead. I can flip you to there. Good.

107
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,980
So just a comment about if you missed yesterday, that's, you

108
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,760
can follow it, we will practice most of that you have done a

109
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,000
couple last two days during this exercise and much more. So

110
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,060
yeah. Yeah.

111
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,820
And something that I will also repeat a few times is that it's possible to participate

112
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,880
only in the browser.

113
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,000
So even if you don't have anything set up, no tools, nothing installed, all you will

114
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,940
need for the purpose of the exercise are then a GitHub account.

115
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,700
But then everything that we will do today can be done in the browser.

116
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,420
But then if you prefer to work in VS Code, you can.

117
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,740
If you prefer to work on the command line, you can.

118
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,140
So we will connect to that.

119
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,760
But if you only have a browser, maybe we're not there on day one or two, no problem.

120
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,080
Yeah.

121
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,740
Should we get started?

122
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,860
Let's get started.

123
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,120
I guess I can head out from the icebreakers and I'll be around answering questions.

124
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,600
And if you need anything, let me know.

125
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,180
Thanks, [name].

126
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,100
Okay.

127
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,780
Bye.

128
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,040
Thanks so much.

129
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,560
And welcome again, everybody who just joined.

130
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,960
not sure we need to do the introduction again but really looking forward to today with [name]

131
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:44,620
teach here collaboration using git and github one of my favorite lessons and we were so much

132
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,340
looking forward to this just to give you an overview on what we will do today and how to

133
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,760
participate and super briefly how this how this document works that i'm just sharing here

134
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:06,660
So, on the bottom half of my screen, I have the workshop agenda, the schedule, so today

135
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,780
we are in day three, collaborative distributed version control, I will open it up.

136
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:20,200
If you are not sure where to find this, so on top of my screen, we have these notes that

137
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,820
you have hopefully, so you have a link to this when you registered.

138
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,160
The notes are a place, and I can see all the 66 people are connected.

139
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,140
This is a place where we can share a bunch of links.

140
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,100
So here, if you don't find the schedule anymore, you can find it up here.

141
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:48,060
If you are looking for questions and answers from previous days, you can find them here.

142
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,900
The neat thing is that this is a document where you can not only read, but you can also

143
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,580
write.

144
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,860
On top here, I can switch between view mode, edit mode, so you can try that out.

145
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,680
And in the edit mode, you can then really try and answer some of these icebreaker questions that we have.

146
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,120
So everybody here should be able to edit.

147
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:22,740
And maybe more importantly, this is a place where you can ask questions.

148
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,800
and the more questions you ask

149
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,540
the better the workshop will be

150
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,960
the more

151
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,280
[name] and me feel that

152
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,500
we are not

153
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,820
just here talking to the camera but we are

154
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,040
really talking to 68 plus

155
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,700
maybe 100 people maybe

156
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
200 people so keep the questions coming

157
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,900
we are watching them

158
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,000
even if I'm not screen sharing on a different screen

159
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm watching the questions

160
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,140
many of them we will answer

161
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,040
a little bit asynchronously

162
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,160
So sometimes the answer comes a little bit later.

163
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,820
Some questions we will answer also in voice.

164
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,120
You don't only have to ask questions.

165
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,960
You can also answer somebody else's questions.

166
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,060
And then at the end, all of the questions, all of the answers,

167
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,500
we will publish this as part of the workshop,

168
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,340
which means that when we write here,

169
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,200
we maybe don't use any personal information.

170
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,780
It's not necessary.

171
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,080
And we have a couple of people who help us here answering and also editing this.

172
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,580
So keep the questions coming.

173
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,060
This really helps us to make it really interactive.

174
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,380
Also, you can add if there is a we need to slow down or make it faster.

175
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,020
But that's also this document for interaction.

176
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,580
And we will watching it when we teach.

177
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:57,960
So please feel free to reach out on this document about the face of this event when we talk, if it is too fast or too slow or something like that.

178
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,520
You want to take more time, need more time, things like that.

179
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,300
Yeah.

180
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,160
And we will also post where we are right now.

181
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,500
So the question should always come at the bottom of the document because as it scrolls up, this is what I'm watching.

182
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,400
And if you get lost, this is where we are.

183
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,240
So if you visit this link, you will land on the page which I have on the bottom part of my screen.

184
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,220
So I'll just make that a little bit larger here.

185
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,700
And I know that the font size is maybe a little bit too small.

186
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,880
I will zoom in in a second.

187
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,360
I just want to show you an overview of today.

188
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,320
So today we have four episodes planned, really all about collaborating, using Git.

189
00:22:39,320 --> 00:23:04,080
And the goal is to give you confidence so that you can confidently collaborate, that you have confidence suggesting changes to repositories, but also that you are comfortable reviewing changes and know how this whole change proposal and review process works.

190
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,080
we have four episodes planned and there will be three exercises today

191
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:19,600
so we have three exercises each 20-ish minutes where we really test out these different

192
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,160
collaboration models within the same repository we will practice code review and we will practice

193
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,140
how to contribute changes to really somebody else's repository

194
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,460
so before I go into the first episode

195
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,600
let me zoom in here

196
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,520
to make it easier to read

197
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,960
the central

198
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,740
I think the central take home message

199
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,120
today will be code review

200
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,180
being able to

201
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
make a change proposal to a repository

202
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,700
and being able to review it.

203
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,520
The most common scenario,

204
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,100
and this is what we will practice first,

205
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,860
will be that we all collaborate

206
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,960
within the same repository.

207
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,500
This is a really good fit

208
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,720
for a research group

209
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,680
that has maybe three people

210
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,540
or five people in it

211
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,100
or 20.

212
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
And then later we will practice

213
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,520
some other scenario.

214
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,220
And this will be

215
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,380
exercise-driven. We will practice this

216
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,220
on GitHub, but everything we show

217
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,440
works almost the same way also on GitLab.

218
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,680
Although we will here not demonstrate other services,

219
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,100
even if in your research you use GitLab instead of GitHub,

220
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,800
it will really work in a very similar way.

221
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,160
Let us maybe start

222
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:06,220
with concepts and here i will connect a bit to previous days and try to just do a little recap

223
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,660
clarification of some of the terms that came up in day one and day two which we will use now in

224
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:19,100
for collaboration and in the notes which i have open here on top you can still it's still

225
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,080
completely okay and really welcome if you ask also questions from previous days

226
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:32,520
So if you need a clarification about anything that came up in the previous two workshop days.

227
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:44,360
Here we try to distill, we have maybe six concepts that I wanted to recap.

228
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,560
So we will talk about the repository.

229
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,580
What is a repository?

230
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:56,180
repository is is the project that contains all the commits all the data all the history of the

231
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:03,800
project all commits all branches and all tags and i will clarify these now in the next second

232
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,400
so what what was a commit again commit was this snapshot of a project so as we code along

233
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,580
we create these snapshots and we give them unique identifiers so each of them can be uniquely

234
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:27,420
identified and compared and referred to and then we have also seen branches branches are

235
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,620
independent development lines and often the in projects you often have a main branch or

236
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,460
a master branch which is the like the default branch but then you can have many more branches

237
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:48,000
if you prefer so and technically in git technically a branch is implemented we can

238
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
think of it as like a sticky note a sticky note with a name on it and that's the branch name

239
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,260
and the sticky note then refers to a specific commit

240
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,560
and as we create new commits on the branch the sticky note moves with these with with these new

241
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:14,140
commits and maybe we have seen tags and tags are also sticky notes but they don't move

242
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,620
and they can mark a particular commit that i want to then be able to find easily

243
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:28,960
so here a typical tag could be called this is the phd that went to the printer or this was

244
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,560
the submitted paper so that later if i want to go back to how did the code look back then

245
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,620
I can find that particular tag

246
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,540
cloning and forking

247
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,680
these concepts we may have seen before

248
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,920
depending on whether you worked on

249
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,780
I think cloning

250
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,600
we have tried it yesterday

251
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,880
but depending on whether you worked on VS Code

252
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,400
or command line or browser

253
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,860
so cloning is

254
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,620
well maybe the last two terms

255
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,180
The easiest thing will be if I show them with a picture.

256
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,040
So cloning and forking are two concepts that we will need today.

257
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,940
And both cloning and forking create a copy of the entire repository.

258
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,380
So here is a repository with commits inside.

259
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,960
The commits are these little rectangles and branches.

260
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,940
These are the sticky nodes.

261
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,800
One is called main, one is called idea.

262
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,560
here is probably a tag version 1.0 here is another branch

263
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:42,860
so this whole repository i can copy if i clone the repository i copy it typically to my computer

264
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:52,340
this could be my laptop if i fork the repository i also create a full copy with all the all the

265
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,320
commits all the branches but the copy stays on in the cloud service so if we are here on github

266
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,680
the copy stays in GitHub.

267
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,680
And if I create a fork from a Code Refinery repository,

268
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,040
now suddenly it's a repository under my username,

269
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,620
under my user space.

270
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,260
So important to see the difference between forking and cloning.

271
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,140
Yeah, just one thing.

272
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,260
Forking is always on GitHub or GitLab, not on your local.

273
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,420
Yeah, it stays on the same service,

274
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,940
but you make the copy into your user name user space but on github

275
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,100
and we will practice both and we will collaborate using both mechanisms

276
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,860
and maybe the next question can be um

277
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,940
well okay i have a question in mind but it i will i will ask it in a moment but before that

278
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:05,120
But one important thing is that when we create these copies, so when we clone or fork, these repositories are related.

279
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,900
There is a relation between them, but they don't automatically synchronize themselves.

280
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:22,720
So if I clone and have the repository on my laptop, and in the meantime, somebody else is doing changes here, the changes don't automatically come to my computer.

281
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,640
we will have to actively synchronize and we will learn how to do that

282
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:37,040
and the synchronization steps are pulling and pushing so i can pull changes i can pull commits

283
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,900
from a remote repository or i can continue working working working but my changes they

284
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,300
don't automatically go back to github i will have to actively push these changes so pulling

285
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,360
and pushing is something we will practice

286
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,560
for those of you who work in VS Code or command line.

287
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,420
So we need a mechanism to synchronize changes.

288
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,340
And the next question that often comes up is,

289
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,180
okay, I understand now that there are two different mechanisms.

290
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,120
We can clone or fork.

291
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,720
So what should we do?

292
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,080
Should we clone or should we fork?

293
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,680
And it depends a bit.

294
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,240
so the first thing we will practice is

295
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,680
we will practice working within the same repository

296
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,840
so if all of you, if your research group

297
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,640
if all of you can have write permissions

298
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,720
if all of you are collaborators in the same repositories

299
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,920
you can all work in the same repository

300
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,200
there is no need to

301
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,980
to create a fork

302
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,740
so for small groups

303
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
no need to fork

304
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,520
we will all work within the same repository

305
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,580
this is the first thing

306
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,700
that we will practice today

307
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,240
but there can also be situations

308
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,480
where you want to make changes

309
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,040
to a code

310
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,580
or suggest changes to a code

311
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,340
where you

312
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,040
which is somebody else's project

313
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,960
some other university

314
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,720
maybe you are not part of that research group

315
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,960
you don't have right permissions

316
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,780
and then

317
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,580
forking can be a really nice mechanism

318
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:24,260
as we will see i'm just looking here at the questions it would be nice to explain origin

319
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:32,020
and dev streams again probably rather oh yeah and i think i just mentioned here in flying somewhere

320
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:39,400
where do we talk about origin because it will come again origin i will just search the page

321
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:51,020
we don't um oh here's origin yes on in this image so after if i see a repository on on github and i

322
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,660
want to have that on my computer i can clone and then you will see a term appearing which is called

323
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:05,880
origin and origin is so git will remember where it was cloned from there is a relation between the

324
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,100
to and origin then refers to it refers to the place where i have cloned from

325
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:18,800
so then we will if i want to publish my changes if i want to push my changes

326
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:25,180
i will push them to origin and if i want to if there have been new changes on github that i want

327
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:31,900
to have on my laptop i can then pull new commits from origin so origin will refer to where did i

328
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:40,200
cloned from and a little bit later in the exercise you can then find out like how do you if you clone

329
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,760
a repository and you forgot where you cloned from how can you find out where you cloned from

330
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,700
what is origin and you can even change it and you can even give it a different name

331
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:57,380
because origin is again it's just a placeholder it's just a shortcut it makes it easier for

332
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,460
humans to refer to a web address instead of using the full web

333
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:07,940
address. Just looking here at questions, and I really

334
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,080
appreciate that they're coming in.

335
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,260
Yeah, also good to mention that you mentioned Git pull and after

336
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,140
cloning if there is some changes on the origin repository. So

337
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:30,480
So that's commits that we pull towards our local commits, local repository on the laptop using pull.

338
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,940
Yes.

339
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:43,180
So again, as I said, they are related, but in principle, independent repositories, they can evolve independently.

340
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:53,160
And then to synchronize changes, we need pull.

341
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,180
Basically, imagine downloading changes and merging into local branches.

342
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,400
And then to do the opposite, that would be push.

343
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,420
if I have a local branch

344
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,320
that I want to make visible on GitHub

345
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,340
I will push it

346
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,940
and all of this will be even more clear

347
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,100
when we then practice this

348
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,320
we will go into an exercise very very soon

349
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,920
we will explain how to set up that exercise

350
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,840
the exercise will be collaborative

351
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,320
which is a really exciting and interesting challenge for us

352
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,280
because we will try to collaborate with you here via stream.

353
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,660
We will try to collaborate on a project together.

354
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,200
And this will be really exciting

355
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,120
because we are not really exactly sure what will happen.

356
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,220
Yeah.

357
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,180
And we say that we collaborate

358
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,640
where you also have direct access to the repository.

359
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,540
Yep.

360
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,820
But we will go through that step by step.

361
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:12,580
And just a quick mention, during the exercises, you will hear those of you who work in teams or in classrooms, you will see the term template, generating from template.

362
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:18,040
And generating from template, it's here in the picture, I just want to show what that is.

363
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,280
So that's another mechanism to create new repositories from another repository.

364
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,520
but generating from a template

365
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,660
flattens

366
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,020
the history into one commit

367
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,740
imagine a cookie cutter

368
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,580
so you have a cookie cutter and you

369
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,640
create identically

370
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,420
looking cookies

371
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,600
for baking and it's a bit the same

372
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,540
idea so this can be

373
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,280
interesting in your research group if you want

374
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,920
all your projects to have a certain

375
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,680
structure to start with

376
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
then look at templates

377
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,420
this is just for the

378
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,480
when we create the

379
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,460
exercise repositories you might

380
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,300
see this term appearing

381
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,700
I would like to now go to the next episode

382
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,420
and

383
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,340
prepare the exercise but we will

384
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,020
prepare it together

385
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,220
and it will be

386
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,820
here we will collaborate

387
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,480
we will all try to collaborate within the same

388
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,940
repository

389
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:25,400
so what is uh um what is the prerequisite for the uh the learners to collaborate

390
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,780
we already you might have a give uh get an email from us regarding this did

391
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,200
rather than you want to say again what they should do to collaborate to the to us on stream

392
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:46,600
so this is for so one prerequisite is github account

393
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,700
then if you are part of our exercise team or the classroom

394
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:59,220
you you will do something different and i will explain what that is

395
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,320
but for those of you who don't who are not part of a team we have many learners who

396
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,920
participate on their own but they still want to collaborate

397
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,240
so on top of the

398
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,960
I mean you got the info via email

399
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,660
but also on top of this document

400
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,280
this is what you need to do

401
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,380
so if you haven't done that yet

402
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,600
because this is a way to tell us

403
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,640
what is your GitHub account

404
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,660
so that we can add you

405
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,100
we will add you to a team

406
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,240
and in a moment we will also give

407
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,840
write permissions for the team

408
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,320
to our exercise repository

409
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,080
and then we will collaborate

410
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,560
and don't worry after the workshop we will then delete everything but we will today collaborate

411
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,400
on a public repository so the prerequisite for those of you who participate on their own is to

412
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,000
do this or have done this and then i have colleagues who then help me adding you to this team

413
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,520
oh just a sec getting a coffee here thank you

414
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,340
and did I even

415
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,360
mention that I'm here I have a

416
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,440
T-shirt and I'm

417
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,460
I will teach using a git mark just for

418
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,440
just for the

419
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,300
branding yeah that's good

420
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,800
but I couldn't see your

421
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,940
T-shirt run

422
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,320
oh good

423
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,520
exercise setup so we need to

424
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,200
we need to do that carefully we will do that

425
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,720
yeah

426
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,260
we will hear whole request

427
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,080
quite a lot today

428
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,560
and what is that

429
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,400
we'll clarify

430
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,680
but I think we want

431
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,120
you will hear pull request

432
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,500
25 times today at least

433
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,640
when you hear pull request

434
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,660
please think of

435
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,740
change proposal

436
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,920
if you use services like Google Doc

437
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,160
it's really similar to like suggesting changes

438
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,900
it's a really similar idea

439
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,460
so we'll do that a lot today

440
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:07,380
without without suggesting and without suggesting what will happen and what do you think

441
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,200
will happen i would like to know if someone is doing without suggesting changes updating on the

442
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:22,580
main or master brand branch and i think maybe most people do that this way um if you are so if you

443
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:29,140
are alone in a repository um you probably don't use any of this you just make changes and that's

444
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:34,740
good so you make commits commit commit commit commit and maybe you create branches but once we

445
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:43,460
are more people and or maybe even when if we are more than one person maybe we want to review each

446
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,980
other's changes before they go to main before they go to master and later we will talk about

447
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,020
like what is the motivation for this but we will have a mechanism to review changes because the

448
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,640
alternative would be we just make changes. But then we don't

449
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,680
necessarily know, we might. One person might not exactly know

450
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,460
what the other person has been doing. We might introduce

451
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,920
mistakes, because I might change something, but I might not have

452
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,840
thought about some side effects that [name] knows about. So

453
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,260
better, I asked [name] for to review my changes.

454
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:34,420
should we explain the exercise and should we try to set things up here yes um so if you

455
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:44,520
if you are part of a team or an exercise room or a classroom we have instructions for you

456
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:55,160
so one of you uh the maintainer the the team lead if you don't have one maybe

457
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,820
don't worry this will not be difficult then assign some of your team to be the maintainer

458
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:07,400
and this is the person who will create your exercise from this template so this template

459
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,760
is not our exercise this is this is the template where we create it from so this is for the teams

460
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,880
and the teams

461
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,560
and the classrooms

462
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,060
they can already

463
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,840
start doing this

464
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,900
preparing it

465
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,940
so and

466
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,240
the other

467
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,960
people who

468
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,440
will be

469
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,480
contributing

470
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,120
to this

471
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,760
team project

472
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,640
they have to

473
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,100
send their

474
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,280
username to

475
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,200
us to this

476
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,460
main

477
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:31,960
dainer who

478
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,280
will approve

479
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,580
you as a

480
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,300
collaborator in

481
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:36,800
the project

482
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,360
repository

483
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,380
yeah so

484
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,040
if you if

485
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,320
you are in a

486
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,160
group a good

487
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,700
group size is

488
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:52,780
four or five people, one of you will do this and you exchange usernames and add them as

489
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
a collaborator.

490
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,220
We have here good descriptions on how to do that.

491
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,720
You can also watch what we now do for everybody else because it's very similar steps.

492
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,180
So you can also watch what we do here.

493
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,940
And later you will have enough time in the exercise to do these steps.

494
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,100
So now let's get things set up now for everybody else,

495
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,980
for the stream participants who are not part of a team.

496
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,860
Yeah, but before that, I would like to remind that

497
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:29,180
when the maintainer of your team gives you access,

498
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,360
you need to accept the invitation.

499
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,380
So you will get an email and you need to accept it.

500
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,700
And also watching and unwatching,

501
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,400
do you want to show that on the screen share as well?

502
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:50,920
yeah i wanted to show it yeah so that so if you get if you get invited to our

503
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:58,040
exercise repository either by us or by your team maintainer there are two things you need to do

504
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,040
one is that you will get an email from github saying that you have been invited to this exercise

505
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,900
do you accept the invitation so then you need to click and say yes and then the second thing

506
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:17,680
and here i will go to our exercise so this is the one that we will use for the all the stream

507
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:25,620
participants and we have actually different versions we have one that's called recorded

508
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,780
and i will only screen share and only show the one recorded so

509
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,800
this is to give everybody the choice that they don't appear anywhere where they don't want to

510
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:47,340
appear but what [name] mentioned about unwatching is so once you accept and this is our exercise

511
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:56,960
repository there is this unwatch button and what this means by default it might be set to all

512
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:05,720
activity and then you get emails about when people send pull requests what was it again pull request

513
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:13,480
was a change proposal if they open issues you will explain what that means you will get emails

514
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,120
and we don't want you to get too many emails so you can switch to participating and mentions

515
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:28,220
and then you only get notified so up here i only get notified if if it's something i started

516
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:35,420
an issue i have opened or a pull request that i have opened or if somebody mentions me

517
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,700
if somebody writes

518
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,820
at past my username,

519
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,880
can you please look at this pull request?

520
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,840
Then I will also get an email.

521
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,340
Or you can just ignore everything.

522
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,520
So this is something that is good too,

523
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,260
especially for the stream participants

524
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,720
because I think we have 40 people

525
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,560
who want to collaborate.

526
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,300
So we don't want you to get

527
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,660
120 emails now this morning.

528
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,620
So I'm watching.

529
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:09,840
and one one thing i'm getting from the notes that if you don't know you are a part of team that

530
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:18,880
means you are an individual learner on stream so you can call you can select this part where

531
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:26,560
following on your own and select which recorder or non not recorded a version yeah

532
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,680
and then i wanted to screenshot one more thing that you can then try in the teams is that

533
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:43,140
i will we have a couple of branches but i will make the main branch i will write protected

534
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:50,140
and this will make sure that all the changes will come through pull requests through change

535
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:59,220
proposals i will make it hard to make changes directly on main and we will explain what is

536
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:05,320
what can be the motivation for this but i want to show you how you can do that so on settings

537
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:14,300
branches i will i want to set up branch protection rules but i was because i also

538
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,480
want everybody to know that this is something that exists this is something you can use for

539
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,360
project. This is not to make things more bureaucratic, but to prevent yourself from

540
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:28,600
making accidental mistakes. I will go to the classic ones because I know them a little bit

541
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,520
better. Classic branch protection rule. And then I can protect branches like the main branch here,

542
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:41,800
main. And what I will do is I will require a pull request before merging.

543
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:51,280
but i will not require approvals or then in in a real life you can for instance require that

544
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,040
two people should approve before something is merged here we don't want to be too

545
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,220
we don't want it to make it too difficult i will just go for this one setting

546
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,880
this setting make sure that i cannot make changes to main directly it

547
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,840
i will have to do it through pull requests and of course we need to first see what it is

548
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,860
save, create

549
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,760
so now my main branch is

550
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,500
protected

551
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,900
I will in a moment do the same thing

552
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,920
maybe I will do it on a different screen

553
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,040
I will do the same thing for the unrecorded one

554
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,280
the same branch protection

555
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,740
I do that now on a different screen, just to not screen share it.

556
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,940
Again, branches, bad protection rules, I protect main, and I require pull requests.

557
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,920
And then for our exercise, I need to do one more step.

558
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,940
And that is, we edit you all to a team.

559
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,560
And I will now give all the team right permissions.

560
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:13,460
I wanted to show you how you can add collaborators to a project, to a repository.

561
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,600
Collaborators and teams.

562
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,380
And here I can either add people.

563
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,080
This is relevant for those of you who exercise within a small team.

564
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,200
So then you add five different people by their username.

565
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,300
Here I will not use this because I don't want to add 40 people by their username.

566
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,580
I will add an entire team.

567
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
And it's this one.

568
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,700
And I can select what kind of permissions would I like you to have.

569
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,340
I want you all, because now we know each other, we trust each other,

570
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,840
I will all give you right permissions.

571
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,460
There are more permissions like maintain or admin.

572
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,960
These can be possibly destructive.

573
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,000
These can be permissions to be able to add people to teams

574
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,080
and manage teams but write permissions is what we will need for collaborating so now

575
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,120
now we can all arrive to the to the repository and this will be part of the exercise

576
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,320
uh i do the same thing on the unrecorded one

577
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:32,760
and maybe we should explain what will be the what will be the point of the exercise what what do we

578
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:42,040
expect from from people yes and again repeating that this is an exercise we we all have right

579
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:49,000
access as i mentioned and give right access to all the members of the project so we are

580
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,080
collaborating we all have right access the same repository and the ones who are working with

581
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,900
teams you will have a repository created from the template mentioned there that so you are

582
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:08,640
working on this repository you created from the template but in the individual learner

583
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,780
on stream that we you collaborated with us as instructors and those who are helping us

584
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:22,580
behind the scenes are part of this repository and you are collaborating with us that's the

585
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:33,320
the main important thing and you're going to do this and we would we will go for a exercise soon

586
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:43,880
but what we want to do from this uh there are some exercise tasks you want to talk a little

587
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,740
bit about issue or rather one or you want to take it as later maybe i can show it so there will be

588
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:55,980
so we will not go through all the steps but the first step will be opening an issue

589
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,900
and what what we mean by that is that in your exercise repository which is now

590
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:09,040
on my upper half of my screen there is this thing called issue and somebody already opened one great

591
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:17,040
so here are the issues you will open a new issue somebody here already working on a

592
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,700
loose recipe. Fantastic. And you will open a new issue and you

593
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:27,000
will describe here what you plan to do. Oh, what do I plan to do?

594
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:37,880
I will work on Oh, I will work on making the guacamole more

595
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,860
spicy. I really like spicy food. So here I have a mechanism so I

596
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:52,620
So I will create it and I will assign the issue to myself.

597
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,040
So I have a mechanism here to inform other people, not only about problems.

598
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,080
So I can inform them about there is an issue in the code, but here I can also inform everybody

599
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,920
on what I plan to do.

600
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,560
And then each issue gets a number.

601
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:12,800
So you take a note of this number two, because later in the exercise, you will refer to that

602
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,360
number. So when we when we talk about open an issue, that's what

603
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:25,460
we meant. And there are a couple of more steps. Should I talk

604
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,680
people through it? Or let people explore junior exercise? Do you

605
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,180
think?

606
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,500
Yeah, I think we may be people can explore on these

607
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,940
things. And then we can show after the exercise and merge the

608
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:48,960
request what do you think yeah but just a thing about uh issue and this is also not only reporting

609
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:57,100
problems or uh letting others know about uh what you are working on but also having a good

610
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,180
discussion issue is a good place to have this good discussion and develop further work together

611
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:07,600
with others if you go to your issue created rather when i have uh commented something on

612
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:13,640
issue that issue that you created so this is a place to you to discuss about these things

613
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:21,380
i can also collect feedback yeah so we can share an idea collect feedback figure out whether it's

614
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:29,460
a good idea but it's a good approach and uh before writing 5000 lines of code and here it's it's a

615
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:35,320
simple recipe it's a recipe book we already recognize it from the previous days the nice

616
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,640
thing is that now we will create this recipe book together so at the end of today we will have a

617
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,180
book of recipes cooking recipes that we created collaboratively here

618
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:49,020
but we have this mechanism to also collect feedback before doing all that work

619
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:58,480
all the steps will be written here so we try to summarize like what is familiar from previous

620
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,440
days but no problem if you don't remember or you went out there we link to where to find this

621
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:13,580
we also try to summarize what are the new things and if below we have solutions and hints

622
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:18,040
and it can be good to go through those so this is not cheating this is

623
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,260
this is the goal so go through solution and hints and go through it step by step

624
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:30,580
maybe one more big picture thing is that we're talking about cloning so you can do all of this

625
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:37,940
the browser and then you don't need to clone so this exercise can be done purely in the browser

626
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:44,980
but those of you who then prefer to use command line or vs code there will be there will be a

627
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:49,460
step where you clone and then if you don't remember how was that again you can then link back and

628
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:59,540
have a look shall we go for a exercise break then and people can do it and go for a break

629
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:07,400
so first thing is exercise right and then i'll break after and here we we thought about 25 minutes

630
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:14,700
which would which would mean that we will the exercise would go until

631
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:22,900
almost five minutes uh after the hour we will then we will then all return here

632
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,580
to the stream and on the stream we will just remind everybody to please take break so after

633
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:34,000
the exercise we will then go into a break yeah correct and then yes but don't worry if you if

634
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,580
people get lost we will then here also demonstrate some of the like highlights um so also [name] and

635
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:47,740
me will be busy collaborating here yeah and also uh please feel free to ask questions uh on the

636
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:56,660
notes super let's start collaborating let's create some fun recipes but let's be kind to each other

637
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:03,060
nice this is a public repository so remember the code of conduct looking forward see you in

638
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:09,060
let's go to exercises and then we will be back here on stream five minutes after the hour yes

639
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,220
let the exercise begin i will try to switch here

640
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,580
in the panel to the right thing hopefully now

641
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:56,640
Thank you.

01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,280
you

687
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,280
you

688
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,280
you

689
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,280
you

690
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,280
you

691
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:56,640
Thank you.

692
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,360
And we are back from the exercise.

693
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,880
This is just to remind everybody to also take a break.

694
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,040
So we will now go into a 10-minute break.

695
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,520
I recommend really break away from the screen.

696
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,180
And in 10 minutes, we will then restart the other stream.

697
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,960
And [name] and me will then go through this exercise.

698
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,380
We will highlight some interesting parts of it.

699
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,600
We will highlight some of your questions.

700
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,180
And then there will be another exercise soon.

701
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,020
But first, 10 minutes break.

702
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,560
See you then in 10 minutes for more collaboration on Git.

703
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:34,240
See you.

704
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:56,800
you

705
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:26,800
you

706
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:56,800
you

707
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:26,800
you

708
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:56,800
you

709
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:26,800
you

710
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:56,800
you

711
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:26,800
you

712
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:56,800
you

713
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:26,800
you

714
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:56,800
you

715
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:26,800
you

716
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:56,800
you

717
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:26,800
you

718
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:56,800
you

719
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:26,800
you

720
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:56,800
you

721
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:56,160
Thank you.

722
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,580
We are back from the break, back on stream.

723
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:01,340
Welcome.

724
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,800
Yeah, welcome back.

725
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,760
I hope everyone had a good break.

726
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:07,780
Yeah.

727
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,340
Let us continue and go through the task, exercise task.

728
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,220
So, [name], you're sharing the screen.

729
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,420
We had some tasks, and thank you for the questions,

730
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:27,340
and we would like we will answer most of them on the live while we demonstrate all the steps here

731
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:37,820
so what question was i think somebody also asked that once they

732
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:46,940
push a branch or have a branch with new commits if they reload the repository some some people

733
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:52,860
saw something like this. And these are three of my branches that I created. I created one,

734
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:57,820
which is called Guacamole Improvement. Another one is Vegan Pumpkin Pie, and there is an unfinished

735
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:05,420
one. Okay. Yeah. On your repository, on your screen, you will see what you pushed, not what

736
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:12,380
your other one sees. So the changes you push towards the main repository, that way you will

737
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:19,400
see and you will be able to compare and make a pull request from the github web service yeah

738
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:25,200
because i'm logged in and here github knows that it's me and sees that i made three branches

739
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:28,840
recently so it suggests that well maybe i want to do a pull request and that's exactly what i want

740
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:37,040
to do um should we look at this one first or which one should we yeah let's just uh look at it but

741
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:43,380
just want to comment when when you create changes and push it that doesn't create a pull request

742
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:50,340
pull request is only on the github or gitlab whatever the service is so you create a branch

743
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:58,040
and you push change to the github repository then from here you start the pull request correct

744
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:03,840
so so far i only have three branches actually didn't i didn't open up the pull request yet

745
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,620
i can do it this way there are other ways in the material but i can click on here

746
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:19,820
and i created one commit i can maybe show you now what what i what are the things that i look

747
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:26,860
at before i create it before i click on the green button i normally verify from which branch to

748
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:34,780
branch is going so that that looks good from i want it to go towards main i normally verify that

749
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:43,580
i have a somehow descriptive title maybe more context here if needed i also normally scroll

750
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:52,060
down and see what are the commits here is my commit and what are the changes in my case i

751
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,900
I replaced Chile by a habanero, but without seeds.

752
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:02,500
And there was also this magic keyword here.

753
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,580
If I use close, closes, fix, fixes,

754
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:08,740
and if I refer to my issue, the issue number two,

755
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:17,800
then later, once it's merged, it will automatically close the issue.

756
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,440
We can later discuss what is the advantage of it.

757
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:27,380
Yeah, just a comment about referring issues on the commits

758
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,860
that you already done.

759
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,460
But the issue will close only when your changes are merged

760
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:36,100
to the main branch.

761
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,300
Even you mentioned it in the commits,

762
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:42,380
that issue on the GitHub repository will be staying

763
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:48,000
until it is merged via pull request.

764
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,500
So if you forget to refer the issue on commit message,

765
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,040
you can do it on the pull request.

766
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,320
So it's the same effect.

767
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,120
Yeah, because sometimes I forget

768
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,880
or I could have lots of commits

769
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,020
and none of them solves it individually,

770
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:06,320
but all of them solve it as a combined sum.

771
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:08,580
So if I forget, I can do it here.

772
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,260
If I forget it here,

773
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:19,340
can there is another way to do this uh under development i think i can i can do that once

774
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:25,900
it's open should i create the pull request like open it up yeah could you uh could you show that

775
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:33,260
this that um drop down and just before you create there is a drop down tab yes

776
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:40,300
there's the draft i think we have an example for a draft one i can show another one where it's

777
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,400
but here I can choose

778
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,620
so I will create

779
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:46,480
the pull request but in a second one

780
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,680
I will create the draft

781
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:52,480
and once you

782
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,080
open it up

783
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,380
you can also link it here

784
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:58,380
on development, you can link the pull request to

785
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:58,720
an issue

786
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:02,520
and even if you completely forget

787
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,420
it, it's not a big deal, we can also show

788
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,280
later what I do if I forgot

789
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,700
to do any of these

790
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:11,320
now

791
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,940
this is still not merged

792
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:14,980
it's still not on main

793
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,900
it's just an open pull request

794
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,880
and here

795
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:21,940
normally I shouldn't review my own one

796
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:23,040
so here normally

797
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,620
normally this would be

798
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,940
somebody else and in our

799
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:29,860
exercise repository feel

800
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,900
free to review somebody else's

801
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,000
pull request

802
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:42,540
and so i will now not not click merge but maybe somebody else can because i really like that

803
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:49,780
if somebody else reviews if use my changes not me myself and also if someone was discussing

804
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:58,420
these issues uh the issue uh on this um issue or the issue that refer you can suggest a reviewer

805
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:02,660
there that if you know that you were discussing with your colleague and you would like your

806
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:09,200
colleague to look into this yeah so if i know somebody who would be really good to review this

807
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:17,040
i can ask here and here somebody merged thanks a lot um you can also ask for somebody to review

808
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:24,820
here on the comment and mention with an at mention and is it safe now to delete the branch yes

809
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:30,960
because it has been merged if i delete the branch i don't delete commits i only delete the sticky

810
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:39,460
out, this is totally safe to do. We promised that we would look at this other one as a draft.

811
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:50,840
So I had some vegan pumpkin pie, but it's not complete. The first step is to remove the eggs,

812
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:57,100
but I need to replace it probably by something. So what you want to sometimes do is open as a

813
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:05,960
draft pull request and a draft pull request cannot be merged so nobody can click here

814
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,980
this is not an active button you cannot merge it it's not meant to be merged it's a draft

815
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:19,260
but it's a nice way for me to inform all of you that um this is something i'm working on could be

816
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:24,860
just for your information it could also be a way to collect feedback maybe i don't know how to

817
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:31,480
complete it or maybe somebody has experience with vegan recipes and i can ask for feedback and then

818
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:37,880
continue on the pull request in the next exercise we will show you how you can make changes to a

819
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:42,120
pull request that is open so if i want to make changes i don't have to close it and open a new

820
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:48,460
one we will practice that in the next step so that's a draft pull request and only once we

821
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:57,060
are ready then i can make it ready for review but we are not ready yet and we wanted to show one

822
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:04,440
more thing and that because somebody asked about tests because some we have sneakily put in a

823
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:11,480
script that runs automated tests and this was only to to show you that this is possible

824
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:18,060
we will go in depth next week where we discuss automated testing at this point we only wanted

825
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:23,900
to know that it is possible to do to couple testing with pull requests so that you can have

826
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:29,580
some checks automatically running and the person reviewing can be then confident that the code is

827
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:34,860
still continue to work continuing to work and i wanted to show this is some unfinished work and

828
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:40,220
this will probably break the test i wanted just to show you how that looks and what how you can

829
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:49,420
then look about what happened so i will open this not draft but and if i open it

830
01:41:52,140 --> 01:42:01,260
it's unfinished uh now some checks are running so how this really works next week

831
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:12,760
Indeed, they are failing. So let's not merge this. Let's not merge this yet. And how can

832
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:17,680
I even make sure that this doesn't get merged? Well, I can turn it into a draft. How do I

833
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:39,000
I do that. Edit. Somewhere there was a way to make it a draft pull request. Convert to

834
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:46,980
draft. Here we go. I can convert it to draft. If I realize there is a mistake, it's unfinished,

835
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:53,180
this way i can i can be sure that this will not be merged accidentally but what i wanted

836
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:59,580
to show you is that okay something failed what failed and why you can inspect this i can click

837
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:08,500
on that and this is a silly test that we set up which will in in this case it looks it checks

838
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:12,200
whether the recipe contains

839
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,640
dash dash ingredients

840
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:15,900
and dash dash instructions.

841
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,280
So if your recipe fails,

842
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,060
it's not your fault.

843
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,380
We didn't explain this.

844
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:22,780
And next week,

845
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,740
we will learn more about

846
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:24,860
how does this work?

847
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,780
How does this part work?

848
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,780
How can you run tests

849
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,680
and build documentation

850
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,780
automatically on any commit?

851
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:45,900
So why, or maybe just a question before we go into the next thing, why do we put so much

852
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:49,480
value on pull requests and code review?

853
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,440
Is this, is this for gatekeeping?

854
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,440
No.

855
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:56,880
So what's the, what's the value of it?

856
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:03,100
It's a couple of more steps, but so what, what's the value of doing this instead of

857
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:05,240
Just everybody pushing directly to main.

858
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:14,080
To me, one of the main things is we have a good discussion

859
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,560
and then together there will be always something to add on it

860
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,520
when someone else is also going to review things and all.

861
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,400
And I don't break things.

862
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,000
Yeah.

863
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:28,140
So it's really about learning, mostly.

864
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:29,360
It's not about gatekeeping.

865
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:37,480
the person reviewing doesn't have to be the senior professor it's about learning from each other i

866
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:41,960
i haven't i learn about what's going on in the project what do other people work on

867
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:47,800
and i can also learn if i look at these pull requests i can often learn about oh that's an

868
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:51,540
interesting coding trick i didn't know that this was possible so you can you can improve your

869
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:57,000
programming by seeing either from the person sending the pull request or from the person

870
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:04,560
reviewing it also there is if if you know something else uh more uh to this pull request you can also

871
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,740
add it when you review these things yeah and that's what we that's exactly what we want to do

872
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:14,420
now in the next step so the plan we have now a little bit over half an hour left we will introduce

873
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:21,780
an exercise and we will then send you again into an exercise session and this is here we will make

874
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:23,800
it we will stay in the same

875
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,200
repository

876
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,820
still in the recipe book

877
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,780
but here we want to practice

878
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:31,760
something really really useful in real life

879
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,500
and that is

880
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:36,860
as a

881
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,140
reviewer

882
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:41,600
we want you to know how to

883
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,380
ask for changes

884
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,280
in a pull request

885
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,720
also

886
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,820
sometimes you see a small mistake

887
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,640
a tiny little typo

888
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:56,880
and then you can even as a reviewer you can suggest a change to a pull request

889
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:05,860
and we will practice this and below on the page you see screenshots and examples and some ideas

890
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:14,740
of what you can what you can try it on another really important one is that if i open a pull

891
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:21,940
request and i should make some changes to it i don't need to close it and create a new one

892
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:27,960
it's not necessary you can you can modify an open pull request

893
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:35,000
and how do we how do we do that and i'm not sure we have really

894
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:43,580
uh explained it yet so if i look at the pull request and here i will just open up mine

895
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:49,540
this one maybe

896
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:52,260
a pull request

897
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:55,800
is always from a branch

898
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,100
to a branch

899
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:00,320
it's not from a commit to a branch

900
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,840
which means that if I add new commits

901
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,560
to the source branch

902
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,660
they will get added to the pull request

903
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:10,240
so now we have a mechanism to suggest changes

904
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,500
or to implement changes

905
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:18,660
so to continue on this vegan recipe i don't have to close it and create a new one i will i will

906
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:24,540
add new commits to my rather one slash vegan pumpkin pie branch and they will get added to

907
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:32,580
the pull request yeah could you show that uh maybe before we go for a exercise uh how do you do that

908
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:37,580
you go to the branch yeah let's maybe i can do it directly here on the on the web

909
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:47,560
so i go i go to the branch and i make sure that i'm on i'm on the branch and here i can make

910
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:56,620
changes where was that this was a dessert pumpkin pie and let's make changes here i will create a

911
01:47:56,620 --> 01:48:02,140
commit. I really don't know what is a good replacement for x for the vegan.

912
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:08,060
Good replacement here needed.

913
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:15,500
So still not finished but I will commit it.

914
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:25,740
Let's choose a better commit message. Add it a placeholder for x.

915
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:30,020
I want to commit it to my

916
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:32,220
Sadovan Vegan Pumpkin Pie branch.

917
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:32,860
Yes.

918
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,760
I have a new commit now on that branch.

919
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:38,640
And if I now look back at my pull request,

920
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,340
here it is.

921
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:43,500
Aha!

922
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,220
The change got added to the pull request.

923
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,920
No need to close it and open a new one.

924
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,120
If I now look at files changed,

925
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,600
both are there.

926
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,780
and I'm not sure we showed

927
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:02,500
because I think it's also fun to see

928
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,040
just to see this collaborativeness

929
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,080
on insights

930
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,820
and network

931
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:11,340
I think it's really fun to see

932
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,340
all the changes that we made

933
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:16,120
this needs now a few seconds to load

934
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:19,320
but we will see all the comments that we did

935
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,000
and all the branches

936
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,820
and we will see how they nicely merge towards the

937
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:29,700
so here are all the changes made in this exercise some of the changes are merged some of them are

938
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:35,320
not merged yet the the little black sticky notes are the branch names

939
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:42,520
and many of these changes got already merged here into the main branch and here they are

940
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:49,760
so this is beautiful and now exercise so here

941
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:58,960
here are the exercise tasks again below you will find help and discussion and

942
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:04,660
screenshots use them this is not cheating it's the it's the part of the exercise so go through them

943
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:11,540
you will a lot of this will feel familiar again we create a new branch

944
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:16,400
for anything new i want to do a new branch it's really a good

945
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,520
it's a good reflex

946
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,840
but

947
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,600
in there

948
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,400
try to introduce

949
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:29,480
a small mistake, maybe a little typo

950
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,580
you can also try to introduce

951
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,320
a larger mistake

952
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:35,340
open a pull request and then

953
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,640
then

954
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,120
switch your head, switch your role

955
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,140
as a reviewer

956
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:43,300
try to practice

957
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,440
suggesting changes

958
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:50,780
to somebody else's pull request there is a there is a hint on how to do that

959
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:58,700
and as a submitter practice how do i implement changes to um to open pull requests without

960
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:04,260
closing and opening a new one that's the goal

961
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:09,800
and uh how much time do we give

962
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:19,460
25 minutes which will then bring us back briefly before the hour we will do a super quick

963
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:26,420
just summary send you into a longer break and then after the longer break we will have another

964
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:31,760
one and a half hours where we can then rediscuss this revisit this and then we will take it to yet

965
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:39,300
another level after the longer break but the next 25 minutes they are for this exercise you will

966
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:48,460
find if you are unsure where this exercise is on the bottom of the of the notes we will post

967
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:57,500
a link to this exercise and what is also nice for us if you can let us know how this is going

968
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:05,520
we don't really see you on stream um let us know is this going well is this too much time

969
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:13,340
too little time too unclear so a little feedback of how this is going for you keep the questions

970
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:23,160
coming anything else i forgot to say no not really but we please ask questions if you have

971
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:32,780
stuck somewhere yes and we'll be back in 25 minutes yeah see you in 25 minutes good luck

972
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:36,200
with the exercise see you then see you

973
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:03,400

974
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:33,400

and we are back from the exercise

1021
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:56,660
and this will be just a one minute summary

1022
02:16:56,660 --> 02:16:59,000
so first of all I wanted to say

1023
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,700
thanks so much for all the

1024
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:07,900
all requests and reviews this works amazingly well yeah also on the non-recorder repository

1025
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:14,120
as well we are seeing that we will do merge later today but i'm really happy that you are

1026
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:20,600
collaborating quite well and interacting with each other it's really cool i got 170 emails

1027
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:24,860
because guess who forgot to unwatch your repository but that's nice i mean oh really

1028
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:26,800
seeing this interaction live.

1029
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:28,840
Many good questions.

1030
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:30,940
What we will do

1031
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,120
after the break, we will now take a one-hour

1032
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:35,060
break. After the break, we will summarize the

1033
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:37,040
session, so don't worry, we will summarize, we will highlight

1034
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:37,680
some questions.

1035
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,080
The one thing that

1036
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,640
we will do after the break is

1037
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:44,480
take this to even the next level

1038
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:46,660
and practice on

1039
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:48,140
how to

1040
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:51,120
suggest changes, how to make

1041
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,460
a change proposal per request

1042
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:59,940
to a repository that is maybe not yours and it doesn't have to be a big open source project but

1043
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:06,180
it could be just somebody else's project that maybe does almost what you have in mind but

1044
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:10,540
and you have some improvements or some changes that you want to do and you want to

1045
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:16,200
have a mechanism to to suggest these changes so collaborating

1046
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:23,900
across repositories and we have now all the tools for this and so that will be then after the break

1047
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:29,580
and then we will have a discussion session where we just want to discuss about many of the concepts

1048
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:34,620
that came up and discuss like why do we do this and what is the what is the point of

1049
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:39,160
all the things that we showed and what is a good balance for real life work

1050
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:46,060
yes and in other words that we we were collaborating together where you have the

1051
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:52,760
right access the next level is after the break would be that you collaborate you

1052
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:57,440
contribute to a public repository where you are not having right access

1053
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:02,420
super looking forward see you in one hour we will

1054
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:05,860
also look at questions and answer those that are not answered yet

1055
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:12,100
looking forward to more see you in one hour back here on stream and thank you bye

03:12:05,860 --> 03:12:06,480
you

1162
03:12:35,860 --> 03:12:36,480
you

1163
03:13:05,860 --> 03:13:06,480
you

1164
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:36,480
you

1165
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:06,480
you

1166
03:14:35,860 --> 03:14:36,480
you

1167
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:06,480
you

1168
03:15:35,860 --> 03:15:36,480
you

1169
03:16:05,860 --> 03:16:06,480
you

1170
03:16:35,860 --> 03:16:36,480
you

1171
03:17:05,860 --> 03:17:06,480
you

1172
03:17:35,860 --> 03:18:01,840
Okay, we are back, but in the preview I can see that the gallery preview looks weird on

1173
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:12,180
my side. Why is that? Oh, now it's Yeah, okay, good. Now it looks good. Yeah, welcome back from

1174
03:18:12,180 --> 03:18:18,560
the break. We have one and a half hours left. And let's get started. Let's settle back in into

1175
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:26,160
GitHub. So we'll come back and we will give a short summary about what we did before the lunch

1176
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:32,400
break yes so first we will summarize before we do something else i will just remove the

1177
03:18:32,400 --> 03:18:34,700
the break information here

1178
03:18:34,700 --> 03:18:41,640
so let's settle in with a little summary of the previous exercise

1179
03:18:41,640 --> 03:18:48,460
we really appreciate all the questions that came in and some of the things we will show here on

1180
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:55,660
stream where should i start should i look at there was a question about what is this test

1181
03:18:55,660 --> 03:19:01,500
checks what is that should we look at that or should we look at should i try to suggest some

1182
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:09,040
changes to your pull request tanya let us look at the test and briefly and people can learn a lot

1183
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:14,760
about it next week but it would be nice why we are having these checks you know yeah

1184
03:19:14,760 --> 03:19:25,260
so up here under my mouse there is a green check mark and you have maybe also seen that on so if i

1185
03:19:25,260 --> 03:19:30,620
on the pull requests a couple of them have green check marks couple of them have a red cross

1186
03:19:33,580 --> 03:19:39,180
so what's going on there uh we we added the script here which

1187
03:19:41,580 --> 03:19:47,980
we imagine that we already run a test in our case it's it's a little bit of a silly thing because we

1188
03:19:47,980 --> 03:19:53,420
we verify whether the recipe has an instructions section and an ingredient section

1189
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:57,440
So if you want, you can have a look at this.

1190
03:19:57,520 --> 03:19:58,280
This is written in Python.

1191
03:19:59,060 --> 03:20:01,320
It doesn't matter now what is really happening inside.

1192
03:20:01,420 --> 03:20:03,980
We wanted you to just know that this is a possibility.

1193
03:20:05,520 --> 03:20:09,840
Then some people asked, so how does GitHub run it?

1194
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:11,460
How does GitHub know that it should run?

1195
03:20:12,260 --> 03:20:16,300
This is happening here in this GitHub workflows.

1196
03:20:18,360 --> 03:20:20,120
And we will not go through it in detail.

1197
03:20:20,120 --> 03:20:24,100
but we have here some instructions

1198
03:20:24,100 --> 03:20:26,160
where we tell GitHub that

1199
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:29,060
on every pull request that is merged

1200
03:20:29,060 --> 03:20:32,840
to the main branch it should do certain things

1201
03:20:32,840 --> 03:20:36,240
and next week we will go in depth

1202
03:20:36,240 --> 03:20:38,500
next week when we talk about automated testing

1203
03:20:38,500 --> 03:20:39,880
and documentation we will use this

1204
03:20:39,880 --> 03:20:42,520
so this can be used to automatically build documentation

1205
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:44,420
or automatically run a set of tests

1206
03:20:44,420 --> 03:20:47,960
and we wanted you to know that this is possible

1207
03:20:47,960 --> 03:20:50,000
so here it's not a catastrophe

1208
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:52,220
if some of them fail

1209
03:20:52,220 --> 03:20:54,380
it's not your fault and it's also not a problem

1210
03:20:54,380 --> 03:20:56,340
if you merged some pull request

1211
03:20:56,340 --> 03:20:58,140
that made everything fail for everybody

1212
03:20:58,140 --> 03:20:58,840
not a problem

1213
03:20:58,840 --> 03:21:02,200
that's the nice thing here about this exercise

1214
03:21:02,200 --> 03:21:04,220
repository that it's good to make

1215
03:21:04,220 --> 03:21:06,160
these to just

1216
03:21:06,160 --> 03:21:06,560
experiment

1217
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:09,400
so more about that next week

1218
03:21:09,400 --> 03:21:12,380
this is just a little like teaser preview

1219
03:21:12,380 --> 03:21:15,320
oh [name]

1220
03:21:15,320 --> 03:21:18,300
let's go and try to

1221
03:21:18,300 --> 03:21:23,740
suggest some changes on one of the pull requests to also edit something on someone else branch

1222
03:21:24,460 --> 03:21:30,540
maybe this is still like previous exercise um so we i will go

1223
03:21:33,420 --> 03:21:40,780
the pull request number 34 this is the one that tanya opened this is a recipe for mango lassi

1224
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:49,180
it's work in progress it's a draft pull request i cannot merge it yet

1225
03:21:49,180 --> 03:21:57,560
but i can give feedback i can help out so there were two things that we we wanted you to know

1226
03:21:57,560 --> 03:22:06,840
that exist one is for me the ability to comment on the code and also suggest small changes directly

1227
03:22:06,840 --> 03:22:13,000
here so i could so instead of asking you to implement a small change i can suggest it to

1228
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:17,400
you so i will i want to show you how that works if i click here on files changed

1229
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:21,180
then i see the code

1230
03:22:21,180 --> 03:22:26,520
and here i can comment on the code

1231
03:22:26,520 --> 03:22:34,820
if i click on the plus you can even comment on a whole range but now just to keep it simple

1232
03:22:36,840 --> 03:22:42,000
Now, just to keep it simple, I will add a comment.

1233
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:45,520
So here on this code line, I could add some comments.

1234
03:22:47,060 --> 03:22:51,840
But there is this plus minus here where I can add a suggestion.

1235
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:59,080
Instruction, mix well.

1236
03:23:06,840 --> 03:23:16,060
So this plus minus symbol, I can, and if I now click on add single comment, it's interesting

1237
03:23:16,060 --> 03:23:28,020
because now in our pull request conversation, it will create a suggestion which we can commit.

1238
03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:34,340
So as soon as I click here, typically it would be [name] clicking here or somebody else.

1239
03:23:34,340 --> 03:23:36,060
if they like my suggestion

1240
03:23:36,060 --> 03:23:38,960
so as soon as one of you

1241
03:23:38,960 --> 03:23:40,660
who has right access clicks on this thing

1242
03:23:40,660 --> 03:23:41,840
which I will now

1243
03:23:41,840 --> 03:23:47,000
it will create a new

1244
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:49,060
commit and I can even change

1245
03:23:49,060 --> 03:23:49,800
the commit message

1246
03:23:49,800 --> 03:23:59,000
so this is a nice way for me to suggest

1247
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:00,700
make a suggestion

1248
03:24:00,700 --> 03:24:03,060
and I make it so much easier

1249
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:09,960
and for [name] to accept this rather than asking [name] to

1250
03:24:09,960 --> 03:24:10,560
implement it.

1251
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:17,040
Yeah. So it is [name] who is changing on my branch. So this

1252
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:19,680
is this is possible when you have this pull request.

1253
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:24,540
Yeah. So this was the tiny suggestion, I want to make it

1254
03:24:24,540 --> 03:24:26,760
maybe a little bit more explicit. What if I want to make

1255
03:24:26,760 --> 03:24:34,040
bigger change here if i want to we imagine that we are in the same research group

1256
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:43,800
um if i want to help you out with this pull request i can also go directly on your branch

1257
03:24:45,720 --> 03:24:49,720
what i will i just want to remember is which file is it that is changed so i can find it

1258
03:24:49,720 --> 03:24:57,540
And the file is called Desserts Mangolassi.

1259
03:24:57,540 --> 03:24:58,540
You could see that down.

1260
03:24:58,540 --> 03:25:00,540
Where do I see it?

1261
03:25:00,540 --> 03:25:01,540
Oh, here.

1262
03:25:01,540 --> 03:25:02,540
Yes.

1263
03:25:02,540 --> 03:25:03,540
Here I see it.

1264
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:04,540
So good.

1265
03:25:04,540 --> 03:25:06,480
So I just want to make a note of this.

1266
03:25:06,480 --> 03:25:13,080
Now I'm on your branch, Desserts Mangolassi.

1267
03:25:13,080 --> 03:25:15,260
And I can also make bigger.

1268
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:21,700
So the thing that we want to show is that anybody with right permissions to the repository

1269
03:25:21,700 --> 03:25:25,140
can also commit changes to other people's branches.

1270
03:25:25,140 --> 03:25:27,140
It's not a problem.

1271
03:25:27,140 --> 03:25:33,660
As long as you have pushed the branch to the GitHub repository.

1272
03:25:33,660 --> 03:25:35,760
So what are good ingredients for mango lassi?

1273
03:25:35,760 --> 03:25:37,600
Mango for sure.

1274
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:42,380
And then yogurt, milk.

1275
03:25:42,380 --> 03:25:43,380
Maybe that's it.

1276
03:25:43,380 --> 03:25:44,380
Yeah.

1277
03:25:44,380 --> 03:26:00,520
tubes. So that's pretty good. I will give it a better commit message. This is the right

1278
03:26:00,520 --> 03:26:11,980
branch. Commit. And if I go back to your pull request, we will see it there. This is the

1279
03:26:11,980 --> 03:26:18,660
commit that i just did and we have a way to make improvements until we are happy with it and once

1280
03:26:18,660 --> 03:26:27,800
we are happy with it then we mark it somewhere as ready for review i guess maybe we are ready

1281
03:26:27,800 --> 03:26:33,820
for review and as soon as i click ready for review then then it becomes mergeable

1282
03:26:33,820 --> 03:26:38,860
and both in this

1283
03:26:38,860 --> 03:26:40,720
in this

1284
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:42,740
exercise repository but also in the other one

1285
03:26:42,740 --> 03:26:43,920
really

1286
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:46,640
also practice

1287
03:26:46,640 --> 03:26:48,940
merging somebody else's pull requests

1288
03:26:48,940 --> 03:26:50,640
so you can really go in and merge them

1289
03:26:50,640 --> 03:26:53,820
don't be afraid of

1290
03:26:53,820 --> 03:26:56,260
nothing bad can happen

1291
03:26:56,260 --> 03:26:58,560
so go and practice also merging

1292
03:26:58,560 --> 03:27:00,080
yeah also those

1293
03:27:00,080 --> 03:27:02,620
working with the teams you can merge

1294
03:27:02,620 --> 03:27:10,840
each other's merge pull requests so you might hear merge requests in between because github

1295
03:27:10,840 --> 03:27:18,140
it is pull request and gitlab it is merge request so yeah it's the same yes exactly the same thing

1296
03:27:18,140 --> 03:27:23,560
two different names i think maybe the merge request is the better name it's more we are

1297
03:27:23,560 --> 03:27:29,760
really requesting to merge pull request is more the historical because this is how it's implemented

1298
03:27:29,760 --> 03:27:30,300
technically

1299
03:27:30,300 --> 03:27:32,100
yeah

1300
03:27:32,100 --> 03:27:33,340
I've been

1301
03:27:33,340 --> 03:27:34,260
there was

1302
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:34,900
some discussion

1303
03:27:34,900 --> 03:27:35,440
long back

1304
03:27:35,440 --> 03:27:36,260
but what

1305
03:27:36,260 --> 03:27:36,800
is difference

1306
03:27:36,800 --> 03:27:37,460
between pull

1307
03:27:37,460 --> 03:27:38,080
and pull

1308
03:27:38,080 --> 03:27:38,580
request

1309
03:27:38,580 --> 03:27:39,420
pull is

1310
03:27:39,420 --> 03:27:40,040
you are

1311
03:27:40,040 --> 03:27:40,920
taking the

1312
03:27:40,920 --> 03:27:41,300
changes

1313
03:27:41,300 --> 03:27:41,760
locally

1314
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:43,060
and then

1315
03:27:43,060 --> 03:27:43,980
pull request

1316
03:27:43,980 --> 03:27:44,500
is you

1317
03:27:44,500 --> 03:27:45,020
are asking

1318
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:45,820
the owners

1319
03:27:45,820 --> 03:27:46,480
to

1320
03:27:46,480 --> 03:27:49,320
pull your

1321
03:27:49,320 --> 03:27:49,780
changes

1322
03:27:49,780 --> 03:27:50,380
to the

1323
03:27:50,380 --> 03:27:50,860
repository

1324
03:27:50,860 --> 03:27:51,180
that's

1325
03:27:51,180 --> 03:27:51,500
something

1326
03:27:51,500 --> 03:27:52,460
interesting

1327
03:27:52,460 --> 03:27:53,980
to know

1328
03:27:53,980 --> 03:27:54,360
if you

1329
03:27:54,360 --> 03:27:54,900
have pull

1330
03:27:54,900 --> 03:27:55,320
and pull

1331
03:27:55,320 --> 03:27:55,620
request

1332
03:27:55,620 --> 03:27:56,160
differences

1333
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:58,800
we have

1334
03:27:58,800 --> 03:27:59,200
cat

1335
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:05,420
yeah we were hoping for this so cat appearance and hopefully more

1336
03:28:05,420 --> 03:28:11,160
this is fun should we uh should we go to the next episode

1337
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:18,200
yes i don't see many questions now but please feel free to ask more questions

1338
03:28:18,200 --> 03:28:24,640
so the next episode is here in the notes and i will navigate to it also

1339
03:28:29,200 --> 03:28:40,100
Before we go further with this exercise, [name], may I ask what is the importance of this exercise?

1340
03:28:40,100 --> 03:28:44,940
Why are we doing it?

1341
03:28:44,940 --> 03:28:52,380
Because we want to be able to not only collaborate within our repository, but also being able

1342
03:28:52,380 --> 03:29:01,120
to use these tools to contribute changes to and accept contributions from other people

1343
03:29:01,120 --> 03:29:04,000
when it's somebody else's repository.

1344
03:29:05,320 --> 03:29:10,140
So in other words, being able to contribute changes to maybe a tool that you use in your

1345
03:29:10,140 --> 03:29:17,200
work, it could be an open source project, you have an improvement, or you have an improvement

1346
03:29:17,200 --> 03:29:21,000
for the documentation, or you have a clarification, or you have a tutorial you want to contribute

1347
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:29,480
to them. And we will see that how nicely this is implemented. And we will be able to do it

1348
03:29:30,280 --> 03:29:38,280
without even having to ask for right permissions. So many things will be similar, some things will

1349
03:29:38,280 --> 03:29:43,320
be new. But this is how we like to build things up step by step. So there will be few new elements,

1350
03:29:43,320 --> 03:29:48,760
but a lot of the mechanisms will be similar to the previous two exercises.

1351
03:29:48,760 --> 03:29:53,540
in this method you can contribute to any public repository

1352
03:29:53,540 --> 03:29:58,220
as long as you have a github account

1353
03:29:58,220 --> 03:30:05,240
so and it's really a lot of fun i think it feels really empowering like a really nice moment when

1354
03:30:05,240 --> 03:30:08,780
and it can be a small thing like a little typo in our documentation but

1355
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:15,040
once if you contribute to somebody else's project and then it gets merged and then you are part of

1356
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:22,560
it i think it's now like a nice empowering moment and also a good networking and you get to know

1357
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:31,260
these people who works in this project and easy to communicate once you are in there yeah it can

1358
03:30:31,260 --> 03:30:35,820
be a way to start new collaborations like scientific collaborations that later lead to

1359
03:30:35,820 --> 03:30:39,480
to projects and papers

1360
03:30:39,480 --> 03:30:52,040
yes so let's see we will need we will now be in a different exercise repository which

1361
03:30:52,040 --> 03:30:57,640
will look very familiar it's still the recipe book but the address will be different

1362
03:30:57,640 --> 03:31:05,180
and again people have a choice maybe you are part of a team but then you need to create a

1363
03:31:05,180 --> 03:31:10,800
a different project different repository and we will explain why this is different

1364
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:18,620
why why it is a different address and um if you follow on your own you can again collaborate with

1365
03:31:18,620 --> 03:31:28,320
us but now the address has changed it's working workflow exercise yeah so just since [name]

1366
03:31:28,320 --> 03:31:34,120
mentioned about changing the address so this is the same kind of repository but the changes you

1367
03:31:34,120 --> 03:31:39,200
have done earlier in the exercise that is in a different repository that will not be here when

1368
03:31:39,200 --> 03:31:48,740
you fork it it's precisely same template to make it maybe explicit so here i'm in this centralized

1369
03:31:48,740 --> 03:31:55,640
repository and i know that many of your nice pull requests didn't get merged yet but we

1370
03:31:55,640 --> 03:31:59,300
i will come back to it in the afternoon so later when i have some time we will go and

1371
03:31:59,300 --> 03:32:06,080
comment and follow up but now what i will do is i will navigate away from this

1372
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:12,800
so in your exercise later which we will start around in 10 minutes you will navigate away from

1373
03:32:12,800 --> 03:32:21,580
this and you will be in a different place for the stream participants it's it will be forking

1374
03:32:21,580 --> 03:32:29,400
either this one if you don't mind that maybe your pull request shows up on stream and if you want

1375
03:32:29,400 --> 03:32:35,020
to make sure that it doesn't show up on stream you use this one so i will go in here it's a

1376
03:32:35,020 --> 03:32:42,220
now suddenly it's kind of a fresh recipe book it's still the same recipe book but now

1377
03:32:42,220 --> 03:32:48,040
we don't have any pull requests yet that's the goal of the exercise we don't have any issues yet

1378
03:32:48,040 --> 03:32:55,840
different address so that's important what is also different now is that

1379
03:32:55,840 --> 03:33:01,680
we are not adding you as a collaborator because that's the point of the exercise

1380
03:33:01,680 --> 03:33:04,420
to show that you don't have to be you don't have to have right permissions

1381
03:33:04,420 --> 03:33:09,600
so nobody needs to be added you don't need to exchange any only any usernames

1382
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:19,080
but now this also means that you cannot merge so now there is somebody who is the maintainer

1383
03:33:19,080 --> 03:33:25,860
in for the stream that's tanya and me for your team that's one person from your team who is

1384
03:33:25,860 --> 03:33:33,820
the maintainer and everybody else can only read but not merge and that's fine

1385
03:33:33,820 --> 03:33:43,120
let us show how it will look like when you fork it maybe before we go for the break

1386
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:52,380
exercise break yes so here what exactly so what everybody will do in the exercise will you will

1387
03:33:52,380 --> 03:33:58,520
make a fork and remind to remind what was the fork again it was it was a full copy

1388
03:33:58,520 --> 03:34:06,800
but it will stay on github so how do i create under your namespace under your username space

1389
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:11,360
namespace may mean that your username but earlier it was under code refinery

1390
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:17,500
when we did the collaborative where you have right access now it is under your namespace

1391
03:34:17,500 --> 03:34:25,380
so i will demonstrate how how to create a fork you can then practice that

1392
03:34:25,380 --> 03:34:38,620
first i make sure that i'm in the right place to fork from looks good and to create a new fork i

1393
03:34:38,620 --> 03:34:43,040
click on this button i can already see actually that one fork already exists so i will now create

1394
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:55,800
second one so i click on the button here fork and then it asks me you want to create a copy

1395
03:34:55,800 --> 03:35:01,980
under this name i keep the name and then where should it be copied to so who is the owner of

1396
03:35:01,980 --> 03:35:10,620
the fork this is me now i keep it this doesn't matter much but you can just keep keep everything

1397
03:35:10,620 --> 03:35:15,480
and once I push on the green button here, create work.

1398
03:35:16,860 --> 03:35:18,420
Now it's copying the repository.

1399
03:35:23,720 --> 03:35:25,200
And now it created a copy.

1400
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:30,660
And now I verify that I'm under my namespace.

1401
03:35:30,760 --> 03:35:31,840
So this is my namespace here.

1402
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:34,020
This is me.

1403
03:35:34,020 --> 03:35:37,900
And everybody will see a different username here.

1404
03:35:37,900 --> 03:35:48,220
Notice also that the fork remembers where it was forked from.

1405
03:35:48,220 --> 03:35:54,200
There is a reference to the original repository.

1406
03:35:54,200 --> 03:35:59,220
And also there is a message that this branch is up to date with the original repository

1407
03:36:00,220 --> 03:36:04,120
Oh, that's interesting.

1408
03:36:04,120 --> 03:36:08,720
So my main branch is now up to date with this repository here.

1409
03:36:09,940 --> 03:36:16,940
If it is not, you will get a message here instead of, when you try working on it, you

1410
03:36:16,940 --> 03:36:17,820
will see that anyway.

1411
03:36:18,360 --> 03:36:19,580
Because we will see exactly that.

1412
03:36:19,720 --> 03:36:25,800
So the other interesting thing about the exercise will be that we will send pull requests and

1413
03:36:25,800 --> 03:36:30,020
then the maintainer, [name] and me, will merge them.

1414
03:36:30,020 --> 03:36:33,740
and as soon as we merge them

1415
03:36:33,740 --> 03:36:38,000
the original repository will evolve

1416
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:40,980
so the main branch will change

1417
03:36:40,980 --> 03:36:42,000
there will be new commits

1418
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:45,520
but all the forks

1419
03:36:45,520 --> 03:36:47,000
and now there are eight of those

1420
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:49,940
and I can even have a look

1421
03:36:49,940 --> 03:36:51,540
which ones, where they are

1422
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:55,460
here, eight forks

1423
03:36:55,460 --> 03:37:01,460
hmm here active

1424
03:37:01,460 --> 03:37:09,940
no they are not marked effective because they didn't make any changes yet but i will now

1425
03:37:09,940 --> 03:37:10,980
show me all of them

1426
03:37:10,980 --> 03:37:21,340
so there are already eight forks this can be also interesting for a project when if you want to know

1427
03:37:21,340 --> 03:37:25,780
who has forked my project this could be also future collaborations these are people who are

1428
03:37:25,780 --> 03:37:34,320
interested in my in my code project and so the central the original repository will evolve

1429
03:37:34,320 --> 03:37:41,100
but all the forks will stay behind because remember what what i said two hours ago three

1430
03:37:41,100 --> 03:37:45,960
hours ago was that they don't automatically synchronize we have to do it actively

1431
03:37:45,960 --> 03:37:48,480
and what you will notice is that

1432
03:37:48,480 --> 03:37:49,180
after a while

1433
03:37:49,180 --> 03:37:52,540
your main branch will not be up to date

1434
03:37:52,540 --> 03:37:54,600
it will be

1435
03:37:54,600 --> 03:37:56,160
behind and

1436
03:37:56,160 --> 03:37:58,500
this is what this button

1437
03:37:58,500 --> 03:38:00,540
is for and that will be part of

1438
03:38:00,540 --> 03:38:02,600
the exercise so part of the exercise will be

1439
03:38:02,600 --> 03:38:04,460
also to later

1440
03:38:04,460 --> 03:38:05,300
update your fork

1441
03:38:05,300 --> 03:38:08,360
and also

1442
03:38:08,360 --> 03:38:10,420
could you just also tell about

1443
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:12,000
this main

1444
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:14,560
tabs because you don't

1445
03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:20,880
see any issues there on the forked repository under your namespace, [name].

1446
03:38:21,440 --> 03:38:21,740
Yeah.

1447
03:38:22,320 --> 03:38:23,520
So where did the issues go?

1448
03:38:24,860 --> 03:38:26,320
No issues, no problems.

1449
03:38:28,200 --> 03:38:30,620
The issue tab here is gone.

1450
03:38:30,760 --> 03:38:31,940
We remember that there was something here.

1451
03:38:32,400 --> 03:38:35,520
And this is because I'm on a forked repository.

1452
03:38:36,300 --> 03:38:42,680
And the default is to track issues only in the original one, which makes sense for most

1453
03:38:42,680 --> 03:38:43,120
projects.

1454
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:48,060
most projects want to have one place where they keep track of all the issues and their ideas and

1455
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:54,400
their suggestions you can change it so i if i want if i would go to settings i could modify that

1456
03:38:54,400 --> 03:39:01,420
but if if i go back to the original one this is where the issues are so if if in the exercise you

1457
03:39:01,420 --> 03:39:06,700
see that you should maybe create an issue or not this is where you need to create it so we have one

1458
03:39:06,700 --> 03:39:11,840
central place where we track all the issues otherwise there will be confusion of like where

1459
03:39:11,840 --> 03:39:17,500
the issue tracking happening and i want to show just one more thing before we talk more about the

1460
03:39:17,500 --> 03:39:24,840
exercise one more thing that i like to look at before creating a fork of a repository is

1461
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:28,620
and this is a little preview until next week is a license

1462
03:39:28,620 --> 03:39:34,860
and we have a session next week on where we talk about social coding software licensing and why

1463
03:39:34,860 --> 03:39:42,140
really matters for everybody. And I normally look at this. So if there is a project and it doesn't

1464
03:39:42,140 --> 03:39:47,340
have a license file, I normally first contact the authors and ask them to, can you please add

1465
03:39:47,340 --> 03:39:54,540
a license file? Can you add a standard license so that we know what I can do with this code,

1466
03:39:54,540 --> 03:39:59,660
so that I know that I can make changes to the code and publish my changes so that I can later publish

1467
03:39:59,660 --> 03:40:04,880
them in a paper. More about that next week. Here we are pretty good because the license

1468
03:40:04,880 --> 03:40:12,200
is very, very permissive. What is recipe book, it's, it's basically public domain, Creative

1469
03:40:12,200 --> 03:40:21,560
Commons, zero. Just looking at my checklist and also looking at

1470
03:40:21,560 --> 03:40:29,780
yeah one thing about this exercise you might see that open an issue in the upstream

1471
03:40:29,780 --> 03:40:35,820
exercise repository in this case upstream exercise repository is the repository where you clone

1472
03:40:35,820 --> 03:40:43,460
where you forked from that's under the code refinery yeah that's namespace yeah so there

1473
03:40:43,460 --> 03:40:48,980
is a little bit of jargon and sometimes we sorry i just wanted to go back to the back to my fork

1474
03:40:48,980 --> 03:40:55,560
so sometimes we we talk about upstream and then we talk when we say upstream we mean

1475
03:40:55,560 --> 03:41:02,900
the original repository and the idea is that changes flow like a river and there are some

1476
03:41:02,900 --> 03:41:06,380
changes that happen to you know upstream the river and then flow down to my fork

1477
03:41:06,380 --> 03:41:15,140
excellent one more thing if you are working on the command line

1478
03:41:15,140 --> 03:41:17,940
then you clone from your fork

1479
03:41:17,940 --> 03:41:21,000
your laptop

1480
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:23,860
and work on it, push the changes to fork

1481
03:41:23,860 --> 03:41:26,240
that is explained here

1482
03:41:26,240 --> 03:41:31,120
yeah, that is an important point

1483
03:41:31,120 --> 03:41:34,040
so again, you can do everything in the browser

1484
03:41:34,040 --> 03:41:36,820
if you want to, but those of you who work locally

1485
03:41:36,820 --> 03:41:38,060
on your laptops

1486
03:41:38,060 --> 03:41:43,180
you will need to clone the code

1487
03:41:43,180 --> 03:41:47,740
onto your laptop and now you need to be careful where do you clone from you want to clone from

1488
03:41:47,740 --> 03:41:55,380
the place from your fork because this is where you can write to if you clone oh why is this

1489
03:41:55,380 --> 03:42:04,880
showing this what do i get out of the way from this if you clone accidentally from this place

1490
03:42:04,880 --> 03:42:10,320
you can still make local changes but then suddenly you cannot push anymore because you

1491
03:42:10,320 --> 03:42:16,880
have right permissions. If that happens, you don't have to delete everything and start again.

1492
03:42:16,880 --> 03:42:23,120
We have in the exercise walkthrough, we have a recovery step because at every workshop it

1493
03:42:23,120 --> 03:42:29,360
happens to a few people. And it's a good exercise that you can recover from this without deleting

1494
03:42:29,360 --> 03:42:40,480
everything. So a couple of things will be familiar. Fork, we've seen it actually on day one,

1495
03:42:40,540 --> 03:42:46,360
but also now I showed it how that works. And again, we will create a branch, we will make

1496
03:42:46,360 --> 03:42:52,680
new commits, we will create pull requests, but now we are getting this into our muscle memory,

1497
03:42:52,680 --> 03:43:00,160
it feels easier yeah so why do you need fork maybe this is because you don't have right

1498
03:43:00,160 --> 03:43:06,480
permission to this repository you want to contribute yeah so you cannot do what you

1499
03:43:06,480 --> 03:43:13,620
did earlier in the exercise in this without forking yeah and imagine here instead of the

1500
03:43:13,620 --> 03:43:17,740
recipe book imagine that this is a project that you want to contribute to this could be

1501
03:43:17,740 --> 03:43:22,380
this could be the library that you are using this could be somebody else's project that you

1502
03:43:22,380 --> 03:43:29,580
want to contribute to it could be it could be the open source code that that you depend on

1503
03:43:29,580 --> 03:43:32,460
and want to you know give back

1504
03:43:32,460 --> 03:43:41,080
so what will be new uh pull request this time the pull request goes from

1505
03:43:41,080 --> 03:43:45,660
across repositories so not within the same it will go from a repository to a different repository

1506
03:43:45,660 --> 03:43:51,560
oh this is actually not completely new because we now know that this is coupled to automated testing

1507
03:43:52,380 --> 03:44:03,200
Then the maintainer, [name] and me, will review merge and your forks will get out of date.

1508
03:44:03,200 --> 03:44:05,380
They will not have these changes.

1509
03:44:05,380 --> 03:44:12,020
So then your goal will be to update your fork with these changes.

1510
03:44:12,020 --> 03:44:19,660
And also this part here, which also will be really part of the discussion session, the

1511
03:44:19,660 --> 03:44:20,800
last half an hour of this

1512
03:44:20,800 --> 03:44:22,440
workshop day.

1513
03:44:24,520 --> 03:44:25,780
For those of you who

1514
03:44:25,780 --> 03:44:27,780
manage all of this and if you get a little

1515
03:44:27,780 --> 03:44:29,340
bit bored and if it feels easy,

1516
03:44:29,840 --> 03:44:31,800
one thing you can also try, just for

1517
03:44:31,800 --> 03:44:33,120
fun, is

1518
03:44:33,120 --> 03:44:35,260
create two separate

1519
03:44:35,260 --> 03:44:36,620
requests

1520
03:44:36,620 --> 03:44:39,840
which change the same part of the

1521
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:41,560
code, the same part of our recipe,

1522
03:44:42,180 --> 03:44:43,140
but in two different ways.

1523
03:44:43,720 --> 03:44:45,700
So what you can try to do, try to create a conflict.

1524
03:44:46,680 --> 03:44:47,660
And then we can

1525
03:44:47,660 --> 03:44:49,500
look at

1526
03:44:49,500 --> 03:44:58,700
a conflicting pull request and discuss what we do about it and you have you have seen

1527
03:44:59,660 --> 03:45:05,180
what conflicts are yesterday but so we can we can also see a conflict in real life and see that this

1528
03:45:05,180 --> 03:45:12,700
is not a problem that's a good thing and also in this case you cannot merge this pull request

1529
03:45:12,700 --> 03:45:14,920
that the maintainer

1530
03:45:14,920 --> 03:45:16,300
has to

1531
03:45:16,300 --> 03:45:19,420
merge it or

1532
03:45:19,420 --> 03:45:20,940
accept this pull request.

1533
03:45:21,480 --> 03:45:21,620
Yeah.

1534
03:45:24,800 --> 03:45:27,240
So you'll be able to open up issues

1535
03:45:27,240 --> 03:45:29,400
and send pull requests

1536
03:45:29,400 --> 03:45:31,360
but now it's up to us to merge

1537
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:31,580
them.

1538
03:45:33,020 --> 03:45:35,420
But the nice thing is that you don't have to ask for permission

1539
03:45:35,420 --> 03:45:37,420
and also the nice

1540
03:45:37,420 --> 03:45:39,060
thing for us as maintainer is that

1541
03:45:39,060 --> 03:45:41,240
we don't have to be afraid like nobody

1542
03:45:41,240 --> 03:45:43,780
just because this is an open source project

1543
03:45:43,780 --> 03:45:45,640
with an open source license

1544
03:45:45,640 --> 03:45:47,760
I don't have to be afraid

1545
03:45:47,760 --> 03:45:49,780
that somebody changes this

1546
03:45:49,780 --> 03:45:51,880
in a way that I don't want

1547
03:45:51,880 --> 03:45:54,020
we still have control here

1548
03:45:54,020 --> 03:45:55,800
and we decide what is merged

1549
03:45:55,800 --> 03:45:56,660
and what is not merged

1550
03:45:56,660 --> 03:45:59,860
but we will do it in a very nice way

1551
03:45:59,860 --> 03:46:00,860
so we

1552
03:46:00,860 --> 03:46:05,520
we will remember that on the other side

1553
03:46:05,520 --> 03:46:06,320
there is a human being

1554
03:46:06,320 --> 03:46:10,020
later in the discussion

1555
03:46:10,020 --> 03:46:12,300
we can maybe talk about

1556
03:46:12,300 --> 03:46:13,680
what to do about

1557
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:14,860
controversial changes

1558
03:46:14,860 --> 03:46:16,480
without

1559
03:46:16,480 --> 03:46:19,760
so what to do about the change that you

1560
03:46:19,760 --> 03:46:22,240
you don't want to merge

1561
03:46:22,240 --> 03:46:24,180
but you also don't want to hurt the other person

1562
03:46:24,180 --> 03:46:26,200
let's discuss

1563
03:46:26,200 --> 03:46:26,920
that later

1564
03:46:26,920 --> 03:46:30,400
here are the

1565
03:46:30,400 --> 03:46:31,160
exercise tasks

1566
03:46:31,160 --> 03:46:34,240
again there is the help and discussion

1567
03:46:34,240 --> 03:46:34,820
use it

1568
03:46:34,820 --> 03:46:37,900
I will also let's paste

1569
03:46:37,900 --> 03:46:38,540
into

1570
03:46:38,540 --> 03:46:41,960
here we have this exercise block

1571
03:46:41,960 --> 03:46:43,740
25 minutes so

1572
03:46:43,740 --> 03:46:44,260
until

1573
03:46:44,260 --> 03:46:47,220
55 past

1574
03:46:47,220 --> 03:46:51,020
where we come back to the stream

1575
03:46:51,020 --> 03:46:53,880
yeah and please let us know how it's going

1576
03:46:53,880 --> 03:46:55,460
in the exercise part

1577
03:46:55,460 --> 03:46:59,740
also any kind of

1578
03:46:59,740 --> 03:47:01,620
questions welcome

1579
03:47:01,620 --> 03:47:02,680
to ask

1580
03:47:02,680 --> 03:47:05,740
in the

1581
03:47:05,740 --> 03:47:07,780
meantime we will be busy here

1582
03:47:07,780 --> 03:47:13,840
reviewing and merging. But see you all in 25 minutes back here

1583
03:47:13,840 --> 03:47:19,600
on the stream. I will just find the right button. See you then.

1584
03:47:19,620 --> 03:47:21,040
Bye. Bye.

1585
03:47:37,780 --> 03:47:38,400

1630
04:10:07,780 --> 04:10:08,400
you

1631
04:10:37,780 --> 04:10:38,400
you

1632
04:11:07,780 --> 04:11:08,400
you

1633
04:11:37,780 --> 04:11:38,400
you

1634
04:12:07,780 --> 04:12:08,400
you

1635
04:12:37,780 --> 04:13:05,620
hi everybody welcome back hi welcome back we were really busy here merging and commenting

1636
04:13:05,620 --> 04:13:11,540
We didn't manage all of them, but I think we managed enough pull requests so that the

1637
04:13:12,500 --> 04:13:19,460
original repository is then enough different from your forked repository. That was one goal.

1638
04:13:20,020 --> 04:13:26,580
Also for the non-recorded version. There are more pull requests, but you can see the changes.

1639
04:13:28,420 --> 04:13:30,740
And everything that we didn't manage, we will catch up later.

1640
04:13:30,740 --> 04:13:37,560
um we will now just spend like five minutes discussing some something that came up

1641
04:13:37,560 --> 04:13:42,940
and after that we will take another break and after that we will have a 20 minute discussion

1642
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:46,220
session so what are the things that we should comment on

1643
04:13:46,220 --> 04:14:00,260
how to synchronize from your local fork on your fork yes that's very important because

1644
04:14:00,260 --> 04:14:03,800
and now in my example here

1645
04:14:03,800 --> 04:14:05,980
there is the original repository

1646
04:14:05,980 --> 04:14:08,160
which has lots of nice recipes, lots of changes

1647
04:14:08,160 --> 04:14:11,020
but if I go into

1648
04:14:11,020 --> 04:14:13,480
if I go into my fork

1649
04:14:13,480 --> 04:14:17,460
and how did I find again my fork

1650
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:21,560
this is me

1651
04:14:21,560 --> 04:14:24,720
if I look at my fork

1652
04:14:24,720 --> 04:14:27,960
well my fork is 30 commits behind

1653
04:14:27,960 --> 04:14:36,580
And so 30, this is probably 15 recipes that I don't have on my fork here.

1654
04:14:38,680 --> 04:14:40,540
And that was also part of the exercise.

1655
04:14:40,920 --> 04:14:46,280
This used to be, in the past, this used to be more difficult because in the past, you

1656
04:14:46,280 --> 04:14:52,980
had to pull changes from the original repository to your computer and then push them to your

1657
04:14:52,980 --> 04:14:53,260
fork.

1658
04:14:53,940 --> 04:14:55,060
These days, it's much easier.

1659
04:14:55,060 --> 04:15:04,020
these days there is a button for it and it's this sync fork and the sync fork will work really well

1660
04:15:04,020 --> 04:15:09,880
and this is because i didn't touch my main branch and that's a good it's a good thing to do

1661
04:15:09,880 --> 04:15:16,300
so i will i will never make any modifications on the main branch anything i want to do for

1662
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:21,720
anything new i create a new branch and then this will always work here so sync fork

1663
04:15:21,720 --> 04:15:26,140
this branch is out of date

1664
04:15:26,140 --> 04:15:28,460
and they mean the main branch

1665
04:15:28,460 --> 04:15:30,440
and if I now click on update

1666
04:15:30,440 --> 04:15:32,440
it will update

1667
04:15:32,440 --> 04:15:34,780
the main branch on my fork

1668
04:15:34,780 --> 04:15:36,420
so on the repository

1669
04:15:36,420 --> 04:15:38,860
that I own

1670
04:15:38,860 --> 04:15:41,320
update branch

1671
04:15:41,320 --> 04:15:44,640
and now I have

1672
04:15:44,640 --> 04:15:45,420
all these nice recipes

1673
04:15:45,420 --> 04:15:46,980
I'm up to date

1674
04:15:46,980 --> 04:15:50,460
for the moment I'm up to date

1675
04:15:50,460 --> 04:15:56,360
with the original repository until some new pull requests get merged.

1676
04:16:02,480 --> 04:16:10,540
There was, I think, a question about deleting branches.

1677
04:16:10,540 --> 04:16:11,780
Maybe we can show that.

1678
04:16:13,520 --> 04:16:15,220
We can also show a conflict.

1679
04:16:15,500 --> 04:16:17,820
Somebody created a conflict and managed to fix it also.

1680
04:16:17,820 --> 04:16:20,960
there was also a question about

1681
04:16:20,960 --> 04:16:22,440
what is this thing about

1682
04:16:22,440 --> 04:16:23,900
what is the difference between fetch and pull

1683
04:16:23,900 --> 04:16:26,500
we maybe

1684
04:16:26,500 --> 04:16:26,900
noted

1685
04:16:26,900 --> 04:16:30,180
we mentioned fetch only in passing

1686
04:16:30,180 --> 04:16:32,660
there is a difference between the two

1687
04:16:32,660 --> 04:16:34,980
what should I pick up next here

1688
04:16:34,980 --> 04:16:36,020
should we talk about this

1689
04:16:36,020 --> 04:16:36,940
should we show a conflict

1690
04:16:36,940 --> 04:16:37,560
what do you think

1691
04:16:37,560 --> 04:16:45,100
I think I'm muted

1692
04:16:45,100 --> 04:16:55,880
sorry yes i was sneezing so i mean oh yeah but uh maybe we'll start with fetch and pull first

1693
04:16:55,880 --> 04:17:04,140
and go off the conflict yeah so at the beginning of today

1694
04:17:04,140 --> 04:17:13,160
on the beginning uh in the concepts and i think it's only mentioned somewhere so there is

1695
04:17:13,160 --> 04:17:16,440
one way to get changes from

1696
04:17:16,440 --> 04:17:19,560
let's say from GitHub to your laptop

1697
04:17:19,560 --> 04:17:23,020
is you can do it by Git pull

1698
04:17:23,020 --> 04:17:25,780
but you can also use fetch

1699
04:17:25,780 --> 04:17:28,500
and they are different because

1700
04:17:28,500 --> 04:17:32,540
pull will download all the changes that you don't have

1701
04:17:32,540 --> 04:17:34,420
and it will

1702
04:17:34,420 --> 04:17:37,980
modify your local branch

1703
04:17:37,980 --> 04:17:40,280
so in a pull

1704
04:17:40,280 --> 04:17:43,000
there is fetch and merge

1705
04:17:43,000 --> 04:17:46,820
but sometimes you don't want to modify your local branch

1706
04:17:46,820 --> 04:17:48,400
you only want to download the commits

1707
04:17:48,400 --> 04:17:49,620
and then you can use fetch

1708
04:17:49,620 --> 04:17:53,120
so fetch will download all commits that you don't have

1709
04:17:53,120 --> 04:17:55,200
but it will not modify your local branch

1710
04:17:55,200 --> 04:17:57,180
and then you can look at the commits

1711
04:17:57,180 --> 04:17:58,480
and if you like them

1712
04:17:58,480 --> 04:18:01,220
then you can do the merge part as a second step

1713
04:18:01,220 --> 04:18:08,320
so usually I usually use pull to my main branch

1714
04:18:08,320 --> 04:18:12,300
that's a very frequent operation I do than fetch

1715
04:18:12,300 --> 04:18:14,840
I very rarely use fetch

1716
04:18:14,840 --> 04:18:16,060
same here

1717
04:18:16,060 --> 04:18:18,420
so 99.9% of cases pull

1718
04:18:18,420 --> 04:18:20,560
it's only if

1719
04:18:20,560 --> 04:18:23,160
I'm really unsure about

1720
04:18:23,160 --> 04:18:24,700
I don't want to modify my branch

1721
04:18:24,700 --> 04:18:25,960
I want to first look at them

1722
04:18:25,960 --> 04:18:27,780
with the git diff

1723
04:18:27,780 --> 04:18:28,660
compare them

1724
04:18:28,660 --> 04:18:31,000
if I'm extremely careful

1725
04:18:31,000 --> 04:18:32,840
then I will go for fetch

1726
04:18:32,840 --> 04:18:38,960
maybe we should take a break

1727
04:18:38,960 --> 04:18:40,660
and after the break

1728
04:18:40,660 --> 04:18:45,220
pick up some of the more things that we wanted to show and hopefully we get lots of more questions

1729
04:18:45,220 --> 04:18:50,660
so after the break it will be just us demonstrating uh and we have a discussion

1730
04:18:50,660 --> 04:18:57,940
session here and you can ask us anything about git and github or git lab yes um so then we would

1731
04:18:57,940 --> 04:19:07,780
be back 10 past the hour we'll just post it here 10 past the hour we'll be back for more demo more

1732
04:19:07,780 --> 04:19:13,240
discussion no more exercises but we will still continue reviewing your contributions and we

1733
04:19:13,240 --> 04:19:19,940
really appreciate them a lot see you in send you see you 10 past the hour just send us into a break

1734
04:19:37,780 --> 04:19:38,400
you

1735
04:20:07,780 --> 04:20:08,400
you

1736
04:20:37,780 --> 04:20:38,400
you

1737
04:21:07,780 --> 04:21:08,400
you

1738
04:21:37,780 --> 04:21:38,400
you

1739
04:22:07,780 --> 04:22:08,400
you

1740
04:22:37,780 --> 04:22:38,400
you

1741
04:23:07,780 --> 04:23:08,400
you

1742
04:23:37,780 --> 04:23:38,400
you

1743
04:24:07,780 --> 04:24:08,400
you

1744
04:24:37,780 --> 04:24:38,400
you

1745
04:25:07,780 --> 04:25:08,400
you

1746
04:25:37,780 --> 04:25:38,400
you

1747
04:26:07,780 --> 04:26:08,400
you

1748
04:26:37,780 --> 04:26:38,400
you

1749
04:27:07,780 --> 04:27:08,400
you

1750
04:27:37,780 --> 04:27:38,400
you

1751
04:28:07,780 --> 04:28:19,040
Hello, back from break. Welcome back. We have now 20 minutes left, which we want to use

1752
04:28:19,040 --> 04:28:32,420
to answer questions summarize. There are a couple of things I wrote down that I want

1753
04:28:32,420 --> 04:28:47,120
to discuss we also want to then invite questions so we will summarize a few things but what you

1754
04:28:47,120 --> 04:28:54,640
can do is please ask more questions please really try to overwhelm us because in a moment i will

1755
04:28:54,640 --> 04:29:00,940
then also invite other instructors to join for really a discussion here about code review

1756
04:29:00,940 --> 04:29:07,100
collaboration oh one topic i wanted to come back to because i think we we used it but we

1757
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:13,980
we didn't really discuss why we do that was this the auto closing issues

1758
04:29:15,740 --> 04:29:20,140
why do why it's good to use these magic words like close closes fix fixes

1759
04:29:21,340 --> 04:29:23,660
what is the what is the advantage of

1760
04:29:23,660 --> 04:29:28,660
of relating changes and issues.

1761
04:29:31,740 --> 04:29:35,440
So do you see that there are one number highlighted

1762
04:29:35,440 --> 04:29:38,960
and one number is slash hash seven,

1763
04:29:38,960 --> 04:29:43,000
which is what are the numbers?

1764
04:29:43,000 --> 04:29:45,400
Yeah, so the first thing, this thing comes from,

1765
04:29:45,400 --> 04:29:48,160
this is the title of your pull request,

1766
04:29:48,160 --> 04:29:50,960
which actually comes from your commit.

1767
04:29:50,960 --> 04:29:57,420
no your commit this was your commit yeah but then this was the title of your pull request

1768
04:29:57,420 --> 04:30:01,200
and then what is this this thing which is a little bit different color

1769
04:30:01,200 --> 04:30:05,160
this is the number of the pull request so this pull request has the number seven

1770
04:30:05,160 --> 04:30:10,520
which means that we can refer to it somewhere else we could be talking about

1771
04:30:10,520 --> 04:30:16,100
oh yeah we did that already in pull request seven have a look hash seven it will cross link

1772
04:30:16,100 --> 04:30:17,820
and link to this pull request

1773
04:30:17,820 --> 04:30:19,860
so each pull request has a number

1774
04:30:19,860 --> 04:30:22,420
but also each issue has a number

1775
04:30:22,420 --> 04:30:23,520
here you refer to an issue

1776
04:30:23,520 --> 04:30:25,880
and this magic word

1777
04:30:25,880 --> 04:30:27,720
as soon as I

1778
04:30:27,720 --> 04:30:30,320
merge it

1779
04:30:30,320 --> 04:30:32,320
and now this was

1780
04:30:32,320 --> 04:30:36,140
so how do I review it

1781
04:30:36,140 --> 04:30:37,620
I normally look at this

1782
04:30:37,620 --> 04:30:39,080
I look at the files changed

1783
04:30:39,080 --> 04:30:42,500
looks great to me

1784
04:30:42,500 --> 04:30:47,320
and

1785
04:30:47,320 --> 04:30:50,240
I will merge it

1786
04:30:50,240 --> 04:30:51,580
and as soon as I merge it

1787
04:30:51,580 --> 04:30:56,580
maybe I can do that here

1788
04:30:56,580 --> 04:30:59,820
really clearly

1789
04:30:59,820 --> 04:31:02,280
I will open on the bottom side

1790
04:31:02,280 --> 04:31:03,780
I will open the corresponding issue

1791
04:31:03,780 --> 04:31:05,380
which was the issue number 2

1792
04:31:05,380 --> 04:31:08,880
and it's open

1793
04:31:08,880 --> 04:31:11,540
and then on the top side I will merge the poor

1794
04:31:11,540 --> 04:31:14,100
changes reviewed happy happy happy

1795
04:31:14,100 --> 04:31:16,360
and yeah okay before you

1796
04:31:16,360 --> 04:31:18,320
merge I just want to mention there was

1797
04:31:18,320 --> 04:31:20,280
a conversation someone would like to

1798
04:31:20,280 --> 04:31:21,360
whoops yeah

1799
04:31:21,360 --> 04:31:24,540
okay let's not so that's

1800
04:31:24,540 --> 04:31:25,960
maybe change

1801
04:31:25,960 --> 04:31:28,360
eight cubes ah let's do it

1802
04:31:28,360 --> 04:31:28,840
yeah

1803
04:31:28,840 --> 04:31:31,520
so

1804
04:31:31,520 --> 04:31:35,820
two let's do eight

1805
04:31:35,820 --> 04:31:40,940
and

1806
04:31:40,940 --> 04:31:44,100
then

1807
04:31:44,100 --> 04:31:47,720
me or somebody else can actually apply this

1808
04:31:47,720 --> 04:31:50,900
I will now do that

1809
04:31:50,900 --> 04:31:55,280
and then you can also do this

1810
04:31:55,280 --> 04:31:58,980
resolve, well now it automatically resolved the conversation

1811
04:31:58,980 --> 04:32:02,300
so that has been now applied

1812
04:32:02,300 --> 04:32:06,080
checks are running

1813
04:32:06,080 --> 04:32:10,360
I will now merge it

1814
04:32:10,360 --> 04:32:12,600
and as soon as I click merge

1815
04:32:12,600 --> 04:32:15,160
we focus on the bottom part of my screen

1816
04:32:15,160 --> 04:32:20,160
3, 2, 1, closed

1817
04:32:20,160 --> 04:32:23,160
so once it got integrated

1818
04:32:23,160 --> 04:32:23,660
into main

1819
04:32:23,660 --> 04:32:27,340
it read this magic word

1820
04:32:27,340 --> 04:32:28,500
and closed the issue

1821
04:32:28,500 --> 04:32:30,600
and why did we demonstrate this

1822
04:32:30,600 --> 04:32:35,480
This was not because I'm lazy and I would be too lazy to click on the close button here,

1823
04:32:36,840 --> 04:32:47,240
but the advantage was that it cross-references the idea or the problem with the commit that

1824
04:32:48,520 --> 04:32:53,960
fixed it. And that's really good for reproducibility, because then if later maybe

1825
04:32:53,960 --> 04:32:59,400
this was a problem in the code and I want to know from when was this in the code and until

1826
04:32:59,400 --> 04:33:06,520
went precisely, it was in the code until this commit precisely. Really, really important for

1827
04:33:06,520 --> 04:33:19,480
reproducibility. And I will now rearrange here so that I can see your questions, but also I see my

1828
04:33:20,360 --> 04:33:31,400
my plan so we can discuss now that now that we have the tools

1829
04:33:33,080 --> 04:33:41,080
how should we approach other people's repositories with ideas and changes and pull requests

1830
04:33:41,080 --> 04:33:52,680
And for very minor changes, so if this is a typo or it's a small change and there is

1831
04:33:52,680 --> 04:33:58,180
not much to discuss, what I sometimes do is then, well, we create a fork.

1832
04:33:58,180 --> 04:33:59,180
We know how.

1833
04:33:59,180 --> 04:34:01,540
We create a new branch.

1834
04:34:01,540 --> 04:34:10,840
On the new branch, I make a new commit and I open up a request and that's it.

1835
04:34:11,080 --> 04:34:19,960
I always create a new branch. So I never sent the pull request from main. Because that can create troubles later down the road.

1836
04:34:20,780 --> 04:34:35,620
That's one of the best practices. And you haven't mentioned about issues in this minor changes. So what is the suggestion? No issues for minor changes or what would be the best practices?

1837
04:34:35,620 --> 04:34:40,060
Here it's a minor thing. I don't need to really open an issue. Maybe there is an issue

1838
04:34:40,060 --> 04:34:50,600
open and I'm actually fixing it. It's more, what if you... So here I have about more like

1839
04:34:50,600 --> 04:35:01,280
large changes. So what if you see an issue and have an idea how to fix it? So what if

1840
04:35:01,280 --> 04:35:07,360
you observe a problem and then it can be it can actually be good to open the issue even if you

1841
04:35:07,360 --> 04:35:12,520
already have a solution in mind because you at least inform everybody else that i know about

1842
04:35:12,520 --> 04:35:17,140
this problem maybe somebody else will hit the same problem it's really good for them to see

1843
04:35:17,140 --> 04:35:24,880
that this is unknown so i don't keep it to myself we open the issue and uh if you don't know how to

1844
04:35:24,880 --> 04:35:31,080
fix it or maybe you can ask for maybe somebody else can or you can collect feedback and then

1845
04:35:31,080 --> 04:35:38,080
refer to it in a pull request and this can also be good so for informing everybody else about a

1846
04:35:38,080 --> 04:35:46,380
problem and for anything bigger so if i have an idea for a new feature it can be good to first

1847
04:35:46,380 --> 04:35:54,540
open the issue and collect feedback so that i'm sure that the solution that i have in mind

1848
04:35:54,540 --> 04:35:57,480
fits into the repository.

1849
04:35:57,980 --> 04:36:00,740
It is what the authors want

1850
04:36:00,740 --> 04:36:04,240
before I do all the work

1851
04:36:04,240 --> 04:36:05,700
and write 50,000 lines of code.

1852
04:36:08,460 --> 04:36:10,420
So talk about it in an issue

1853
04:36:10,420 --> 04:36:11,640
and then do the coding

1854
04:36:11,640 --> 04:36:14,140
because it avoids surprises later.

1855
04:36:20,320 --> 04:36:21,800
Yeah, discuss and get feedback

1856
04:36:21,800 --> 04:36:22,500
before you code.

1857
04:36:24,540 --> 04:36:33,640
When suggesting to an open project or collaborative project, some ideas and all, there will be

1858
04:36:33,640 --> 04:36:40,260
any code of conduct or something that what you suggest, [name]?

1859
04:36:40,260 --> 04:36:44,360
I think any project that is bigger will sooner or later maybe need code of conduct, also

1860
04:36:44,360 --> 04:36:50,520
contribution guide, or just a document where you can describe how would you like contributions

1861
04:36:50,520 --> 04:36:56,240
to be? How would you like them to be submitted? And also certain standards that you expect in

1862
04:36:56,240 --> 04:37:08,460
your project to be followed. Some suggestion about how to proceed from here, what we learned

1863
04:37:08,460 --> 04:37:22,660
this two three days yeah um i mean one way to that you can practice this and be also incredibly

1864
04:37:22,660 --> 04:37:31,060
useful for our project is that if i scroll up here in the lesson so i'll scroll all the way up

1865
04:37:31,060 --> 04:37:39,700
our lessons are on GitHub. All of them are open source. If you see things that we could have done

1866
04:37:39,700 --> 04:37:43,860
better here and explained better, maybe there is a better wording or maybe some exercise step

1867
04:37:43,860 --> 04:37:53,540
wasn't clear enough. If I right click edit on GitHub, this is the repository with the lesson.

1868
04:37:54,000 --> 04:37:58,840
Also here, you can open issues and you can see that there are a couple of issues that

1869
04:37:58,840 --> 04:38:01,340
we know about, two of them are from today

1870
04:38:01,340 --> 04:38:03,600
you can send us

1871
04:38:03,600 --> 04:38:04,920
pull requests with improvements

1872
04:38:04,920 --> 04:38:05,860
this

1873
04:38:05,860 --> 04:38:07,640
will

1874
04:38:07,640 --> 04:38:11,020
really help the project a lot

1875
04:38:11,020 --> 04:38:13,640
but then

1876
04:38:13,640 --> 04:38:14,500
for your own work

1877
04:38:14,500 --> 04:38:16,280
really trying to

1878
04:38:16,280 --> 04:38:18,720
team up with somebody

1879
04:38:18,720 --> 04:38:20,900
try to find somebody who

1880
04:38:20,900 --> 04:38:21,780
for code review

1881
04:38:21,780 --> 04:38:25,220
I would try to implement this

1882
04:38:25,220 --> 04:38:27,140
not with a lot of bureaucracy, not with a lot of

1883
04:38:27,140 --> 04:38:28,120
checks and

1884
04:38:28,120 --> 04:38:36,480
but implementing code review for repositories with two people or more so create a common

1885
04:38:36,480 --> 04:38:42,040
repository invite your friend as a collaborator and collaborate together try this out the like

1886
04:38:42,040 --> 04:38:48,940
the code review set the main branch as read-only review these are the changes it will it will delay

1887
04:38:48,940 --> 04:38:54,280
it will delay the changes a little bit until they are in main but with the benefit that we learn

1888
04:38:54,280 --> 04:39:04,520
about it, we improve our coding, maybe we catch a possible mistake. But now, up to you.

1889
04:39:04,520 --> 04:39:16,980
What are the things that you would like to know about GitHub collaboration? Which question

1890
04:39:16,980 --> 04:39:36,160
should we highlight there was Oh, there is this question around line 416. I'm just looking

1891
04:39:36,160 --> 04:39:54,000
you did. So it is this one? Yeah. That is answered.

1892
04:39:54,000 --> 04:40:08,040
yeah so the so the question is why should we create a new branch for every new change

1893
04:40:08,040 --> 04:40:13,940
and not just continue on main even if it's i'm the only person on my fork

1894
04:40:13,940 --> 04:40:20,600
and the reason is that and it might be already answered is that

1895
04:40:20,600 --> 04:40:26,860
pull requests are from branch to branch they are not from commit to branch

1896
04:40:26,860 --> 04:40:32,860
so if i now send a pull request on main and maybe the pull request takes two weeks to review

1897
04:40:33,860 --> 04:40:40,380
now i need to wait because if i now continue on my main branch all the new commits will also get

1898
04:40:40,380 --> 04:40:44,000
added to the pull request which might surprise me it might surprise the person reviewing

1899
04:40:44,000 --> 04:40:50,920
so now i need to wait if i created a side branch i don't need to wait i just send a

1900
04:40:50,920 --> 04:40:56,360
pull request and continue my work and wait until that thing is merged but there is another reason

1901
04:40:56,360 --> 04:41:03,080
and that is once it's once your pull request is merged it will typically create a merge commit

1902
04:41:03,080 --> 04:41:10,460
and that is a commit that you don't have on your main so now your it will the history will start

1903
04:41:10,460 --> 04:41:17,980
be weird on your main branch on your forked main branch so to avoid these trouble good to create a

1904
04:41:17,980 --> 04:41:25,500
extra branch i i personally like to have a branch for everything even the minor changes as well

1905
04:41:25,500 --> 04:41:34,220
because it avoids many my conflicts may come after i change something yeah

1906
04:41:34,220 --> 04:41:34,340
Yeah.

1907
04:41:36,740 --> 04:41:38,280
And somewhere there was also a question,

1908
04:41:38,420 --> 04:41:39,500
well, should we then delete?

1909
04:41:39,760 --> 04:41:41,280
So branches that have been merged,

1910
04:41:41,320 --> 04:41:42,760
should we delete them, keep them?

1911
04:41:44,640 --> 04:41:45,760
You can keep them.

1912
04:41:45,860 --> 04:41:46,840
There is no really harm.

1913
04:41:48,340 --> 04:41:52,060
At some point, maybe it becomes a little bit chaotic

1914
04:41:52,060 --> 04:41:56,180
because you see 40 branches there that have been merged

1915
04:41:56,180 --> 04:41:58,800
and then you can clean up and delete them.

1916
04:41:59,540 --> 04:42:01,820
And deleting branches in this case

1917
04:42:01,820 --> 04:42:05,800
means only removing the sticky notes so you will not delete the commits

1918
04:42:05,800 --> 04:42:19,600
so we have five more minutes but it would be nice to remind them about the feedback

1919
04:42:19,600 --> 04:42:26,940
yeah that's at the end of the end of the notes please let us know how how was the speed and

1920
04:42:26,940 --> 04:42:29,060
and please be honest we are not offended

1921
04:42:29,060 --> 04:42:30,840
this is

1922
04:42:30,840 --> 04:42:32,960
this thing is what we look at when we

1923
04:42:32,960 --> 04:42:35,000
prepare the next workshop in half a year

1924
04:42:35,000 --> 04:42:37,260
so we really want to know

1925
04:42:37,260 --> 04:42:38,340
how was the speed

1926
04:42:38,340 --> 04:42:40,380
how was the level

1927
04:42:40,380 --> 04:42:42,460
was it

1928
04:42:42,460 --> 04:42:44,560
useful what was missing

1929
04:42:44,560 --> 04:42:46,980
what was the part that you liked the most

1930
04:42:46,980 --> 04:42:48,580
what was the part that you liked the least

1931
04:42:48,580 --> 04:42:51,660
and then

1932
04:42:51,660 --> 04:42:55,160
we use this when we create the next

1933
04:42:55,160 --> 04:42:55,460
edition

1934
04:42:55,460 --> 04:42:57,320
so these

1935
04:42:57,320 --> 04:42:57,760
lessons are

1936
04:42:57,760 --> 04:42:57,940
really

1937
04:42:57,940 --> 04:42:58,420
continuously

1938
04:42:58,420 --> 04:42:58,960
improved

1939
04:42:58,960 --> 04:43:01,400
and we

1940
04:43:01,400 --> 04:43:01,720
really

1941
04:43:01,720 --> 04:43:01,960
really

1942
04:43:01,960 --> 04:43:02,220
really

1943
04:43:02,220 --> 04:43:02,640
appreciate

1944
04:43:02,640 --> 04:43:02,780
your

1945
04:43:02,780 --> 04:43:03,020
feedback

1946
04:43:03,020 --> 04:43:03,320
here

1947
04:43:03,320 --> 04:43:05,480
yeah

1948
04:43:05,480 --> 04:43:06,160
and also

1949
04:43:06,160 --> 04:43:06,560
this

1950
04:43:06,560 --> 04:43:07,180
notes

1951
04:43:07,180 --> 04:43:07,600
will be

1952
04:43:07,600 --> 04:43:08,160
archived

1953
04:43:08,160 --> 04:43:08,560
and you

1954
04:43:08,560 --> 04:43:08,980
will get

1955
04:43:08,980 --> 04:43:09,460
an email

1956
04:43:09,460 --> 04:43:11,780
it will

1957
04:43:11,780 --> 04:43:12,420
be open

1958
04:43:12,420 --> 04:43:13,960
after the

1959
04:43:13,960 --> 04:43:14,300
workshop

1960
04:43:14,300 --> 04:43:15,280
as well

1961
04:43:15,280 --> 04:43:16,160
yeah

1962
04:43:16,160 --> 04:43:16,580
so I

1963
04:43:16,580 --> 04:43:16,720
will

1964
04:43:16,720 --> 04:43:17,300
archive

1965
04:43:17,300 --> 04:43:17,700
these

1966
04:43:17,700 --> 04:43:19,420
later

1967
04:43:19,420 --> 04:43:19,780
today

1968
04:43:19,780 --> 04:43:20,120
they will

1969
04:43:20,120 --> 04:43:20,420
be part

1970
04:43:20,420 --> 04:43:20,660
of the

1971
04:43:20,660 --> 04:43:20,900
workshop

1972
04:43:20,900 --> 04:43:21,400
site

1973
04:43:21,400 --> 04:43:23,220
we will

1974
04:43:23,220 --> 04:43:23,700
also go

1975
04:43:23,700 --> 04:43:23,980
through

1976
04:43:23,980 --> 04:43:24,520
all the

1977
04:43:24,520 --> 04:43:24,940
open

1978
04:43:24,940 --> 04:43:29,660
request that got we didn't forget them we just were really busy here jumping between windows

1979
04:43:30,860 --> 04:43:36,700
so we will review and merge everything sometime after the event we will also delete the exercise

1980
04:43:36,700 --> 04:43:42,140
repository so you don't have to be worried that something will be left behind hopefully you know

1981
04:43:43,340 --> 04:43:51,660
are a bit more comfortable with these tools and are more comfortable in using github and gitlab

1982
04:43:51,660 --> 04:43:53,320
app for collaboration.

1983
04:43:55,580 --> 04:43:57,200
Also continue this

1984
04:43:57,200 --> 04:43:59,040
using this after

1985
04:43:59,040 --> 04:44:00,020
this.

1986
04:44:01,640 --> 04:44:03,060
That's the best practice.

1987
04:44:03,280 --> 04:44:05,080
You can inspire your

1988
04:44:05,080 --> 04:44:07,580
team, your colleagues

1989
04:44:07,580 --> 04:44:08,620
who works together

1990
04:44:08,620 --> 04:44:11,080
if they are not yet on GitHub

1991
04:44:11,080 --> 04:44:12,960
using version control.

1992
04:44:13,460 --> 04:44:15,200
This is the best way to learn together

1993
04:44:15,200 --> 04:44:16,860
and contribute together.

1994
04:44:19,360 --> 04:44:21,400
If you don't have

1995
04:44:21,400 --> 04:44:26,000
somebody to collaborate with you don't hesitate to i don't know ask me in a pull request my

1996
04:44:26,000 --> 04:44:33,160
username is [name] and i can give some comments and also don't hesitate to go to your favorite

1997
04:44:33,160 --> 04:44:38,160
project look at the documentation let's see if you find an improvement improvement to their

1998
04:44:38,160 --> 04:44:42,600
documentation and try to send the pull requests improving their documentation they will be really

1999
04:44:42,600 --> 04:44:50,960
happy about it maybe we should spend two minutes just to give a little teaser about next week what

2000
04:44:50,960 --> 04:44:52,460
what will come up

2001
04:44:52,460 --> 04:44:54,980
so next week

2002
04:44:54,980 --> 04:44:55,460
we will

2003
04:44:55,460 --> 04:44:58,120
we will still use

2004
04:44:58,120 --> 04:45:00,500
git and github quite a lot

2005
04:45:00,500 --> 04:45:03,040
but we will really

2006
04:45:03,040 --> 04:45:04,300
apply them to

2007
04:45:04,300 --> 04:45:07,080
yeah to

2008
04:45:07,080 --> 04:45:08,120
reproducible

2009
04:45:08,120 --> 04:45:10,380
research software development

2010
04:45:10,380 --> 04:45:13,160
so on tuesday we will

2011
04:45:13,160 --> 04:45:14,400
look at

2012
04:45:14,400 --> 04:45:16,900
social coding

2013
04:45:16,900 --> 04:45:19,100
software licensing and reproducibility

2014
04:45:19,100 --> 04:45:22,080
and I hope I don't mix up the days

2015
04:45:22,080 --> 04:45:26,280
we will then also discuss documentation

2016
04:45:26,280 --> 04:45:30,400
how to document code

2017
04:45:30,400 --> 04:45:33,960
how does useful documentation look like

2018
04:45:33,960 --> 04:45:36,180
but also how to set up technically

2019
04:45:36,180 --> 04:45:39,320
so that you have a really useful documentation

2020
04:45:39,320 --> 04:45:40,240
for people to read

2021
04:45:40,240 --> 04:45:42,920
automated testing

2022
04:45:42,920 --> 04:45:45,420
Jupyter notebooks

2023
04:45:45,420 --> 04:45:47,960
modular code development

2024
04:45:47,960 --> 04:45:51,200
and probably I forgot something

2025
04:45:51,200 --> 04:45:52,260
so these are

2026
04:45:52,260 --> 04:45:54,660
topics of next week

2027
04:45:54,660 --> 04:46:00,860
so I would like to thank you

2028
04:46:00,860 --> 04:46:02,800
for leading this session and [name]

for

2030
04:46:03,340 --> 04:46:06,780
doing this live stream

2031
04:46:06,780 --> 04:46:08,940
and there were people behind

2032
04:46:08,940 --> 04:46:10,800
the scene you might not have seen today

2033
04:46:10,800 --> 04:46:12,840
they all worked together

2034
04:46:12,840 --> 04:46:14,900
to successfully run

2035
04:46:14,900 --> 04:46:15,620
this workshop

2036
04:46:15,620 --> 04:46:21,360
yes many thanks to everybody so there is a lot of

2037
04:46:21,360 --> 04:46:25,180
work before and during the workshop happening that is maybe not immediately visible

2038
04:46:25,180 --> 04:46:36,140
yeah thanks to all who contributed today via pull request or issues and all

2039
04:46:36,140 --> 04:46:41,000
and we had a good time reviewing your pull request and suggestions that was very fun

2040
04:46:41,000 --> 04:46:47,120
so thanks so much so maybe we can stop the

2041
04:46:47,120 --> 04:46:53,160
yeah streaming recording and hopefully we see all of you next week

2042
04:46:53,160 --> 04:46:57,420
it's not too late for people to still join so tell your friends

2043
04:46:57,420 --> 04:47:02,900
next week it will be more applied more demonstrations

2044
04:47:02,900 --> 04:47:07,680
but still it's possible to then also go through these exercises on your own

2045
04:47:07,680 --> 04:47:16,760
yeah thank you thanks so much i will oh maybe [name] can help me now to tell me which button
