hello

20
00:08:59,660 --> 00:08:59,980
hello

21
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,000
hello

22
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,040
hello

23
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,420
hello can anyone see or hear us out there

24
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,480
can anyone see or hear us out there

25
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,420
can anyone see or hear us out there

26
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,820
we know

27
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,840
we know

28
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:14,960
we know yes a stream i can't be hurt okay good

29
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,520
so yeah we are

30
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,540
so yeah we are

31
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,120
so yeah we are here going live into icebreaker time

32
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,140
here going live into icebreaker time

33
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,280
here going live into icebreaker time so our point now is just to chat with

34
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,300
so our point now is just to chat with

35
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,040
so our point now is just to chat with you a little bit before we start

36
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,060
you a little bit before we start

37
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,160
you a little bit before we start the main course right on time in

38
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,180
the main course right on time in

39
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:37,060
around eight minutes but as a starting point i'm [name] and with me here is [name] hello and

40
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:45,460
what you see on the screen right now is the notes document so this is being shared

41
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,220
this has been shared to registered participants so it's our main way of communicating so um

42
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:00,260
it's not public it's the bonus you get for actually registering um so check your emails

43
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,860
and reminders and you'll see it at the top is some general hint that we'll talk about

44
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,780
but as you go down lower you'll notice that if you switch it to edit mode

45
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,140
then you can write something here so can someone write a new question this uses a format called

46
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:29,460
markdown um it's really easy to see so don't really worry about it just copy what other people

47
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:40,260
do um let's see yes there's somewhat some question coming so instead of using course chat or

48
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,140
voice chat things like that you can write a question here anytime and then get an answer

49
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,140
anytime so we have a bunch of people that will be watching and

50
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,980
answering um so we start with some icebreakers to practice this so from where are you connecting

51
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,860
how's the weather here so if everyone can open this up and go right down where you are and what

52
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:15,620
the weather is uh in [name] where are you and what's the weather like so today i'm actually in

53
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,060
Keilaniemi, Espoo, CSC building so it's exciting to be somewhere else

54
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,420
than the usual alto although it's what 700 meters away from where I normally am

55
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:33,700
maybe a little bit more maybe one kilometer and i guess you are in helsinki center

56
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:42,980
[name] yeah i'm in my normal place so well yeah easier to wake up and set up here than

57
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,660
travel and set up and also you might see my cat which is it's already awake

58
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,420
yeah well i mean if you call sitting around somewhere being awake

59
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,140
it's actually not in the room right now so hopefully it comes later

60
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,260
but yeah my weather is probably the same as you cloud

61
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,220
but okay have you ever wished you had a time machine to a code time machine to travel back

62
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,060
so where does this question come from so every so often a friend of

63
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,420
mine comes up and says oh yeah i really need to start using version control because

64
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,940
i had working code and it's not working anymore and i don't know what happened

65
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:43,220
and it's always really sad because it's like such a frustrating um situation to have

66
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,980
something that works and broke and now you don't know how it works has this ever happened to you

67
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,860
i would say daily but i'm very happy that things like undo exist but sometimes with code

68
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,860
when you start jumping at it in different bits until it just doesn't just doesn't make it so

69
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,500
i guess what we will learn today is that sometimes although we maybe can't really

70
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,060
travel back in time but there are ways to go back to a moment where things were working yeah

71
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,580
but that's basically the point of the first week so

72
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,380
we learned all about something called version control that provides this code

73
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,780
time machine not only for you to see backwards in time but to go backwards in time when you need to

74
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,540
can people add stories about when they've lost code or stuff like that and you need to

75
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,100
need to fix it or maybe that's a bit too much

76
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,140
um so data sometimes i mean

77
00:13:51,220 --> 00:14:00,820
in that sometimes the data maybe gets changed for whatever pre-processing step and then you know so

78
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,940
even though we will talk more about code but but i feel that sometimes especially if the data is

79
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:13,860
small enough that can live with the together with the code i find it very useful yeah my standard

80
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,900
example i always give is that i'm using version control and i say well it's not perfect i'm not

81
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,660
going to record my stuff it becomes my code because i'm not going to record my stuff because it's a

82
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,180
it becomes a few days and stuff is broken

83
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,920
and I've changed too much

84
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,280
and I don't know what happened

85
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,140
and I end up spending several more days

86
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,540
trying to just go back to where I was before.

87
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,940
But, oh well.

88
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,900
So, [name], how long have you been teaching in Code Refinery?

89
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,580
I don't remember.

90
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,200
I remember it was before this online system,

91
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,220
so before COVID, basically.

92
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,540
2019 could have been one of the first Code Refineries.

93
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,500
And you, how long have you been with Code Refinery?

94
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,120
Maybe 2017.

95
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,780
We hosted the first in-person Code Refinery in Espoo

96
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,740
on the Aalto University campus.

97
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,820
And then we did it around once a year,

98
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,780
or no, twice a year until COVID

99
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,600
and then twice a year,

100
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,380
but with everyone.

101
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Does anyone have any general questions

102
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,380
for us to talk about?

103
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,060
You can ask, well, up here or down below, whatever.

104
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,860
And if you just started listening to the stream,

105
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,520
so we will go through the full introduction

106
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,060
on how to use this shared notes document

107
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,640
and how to enjoy the stream fully.

108
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,960
It's nice to see that there's so many countries this time.

109
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,580
Usually we span across kind of the Nordics,

110
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,580
Finland, Sweden, and Norway,

111
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,020
but there's quite many people from Germany this time

112
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,700
and Netherlands.

113
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,520
Yeah, your outreach did pretty good.

114
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,360
So we've got about one more minute left.

115
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,660
So, [name], do you want to tell a little bit about yourself

116
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,420
and how you got where you are while we're waiting?

117
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,420
Yeah, I think that, and this is a similar story,

118
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,660
I wanted to stay in research,

119
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,660
but I didn't want to follow the standard academic path,

120
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
become a PI, professor, whatever.

121
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,660
The fun stuff for me, it's when you get your hands on data

122
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,480
and do some brainstorming,

123
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,520
wrangling of data,

124
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,880
or also teach others and help others working with their data.

125
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,960
And so I'm really enjoying my work behind the scenes.

126
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,920
And what about you, [name]?

127
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah, I mean, same.

128
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,600
I guess I was somewhat like you,

129
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,320
but less so wanted to follow the academic career path,

130
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,520
but being involved in research and helping people,

131
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,960
definitely a very nice thing to do.

132
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
And now we're here streaming.

133
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,840
Who would have thought?

134
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,560
Anyway, my clock just turned 10 o'clock

135
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,480
and I see [name] appearing.

136
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
Should I switch to your screen and we can begin?

137
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm sharing.

138
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hello, [name].

139
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Hello.

140
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,040
I just heard an echo somehow,

141
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,200
or two microphones picking up.

142
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,160
Okay, yeah.

143
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,200
So I guess, yeah.

144
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,360
So I'll head out for the intro and see you later.

145
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,120
Thank you.

146
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,960
See you in a bit.

147
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
Okay, bye.

148
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,560
So hello everyone,

149
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,320
and welcome to this,

150
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,000
what we just found out to be the 11th

151
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,480
of our big code refinery workshops,

152
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,760
big meaning beyond 100 people

153
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,640
and online and open for everyone.

154
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,720
So we'll be going through some practicalities now.

155
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,800
So maybe first, hi, I'm [name].

156
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I'm a research software engineer at CSC in Finland.

157
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,160
And I'll be teaching with together with [name],

158
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,160
actually day four of reproducible research and social coding.

159
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,960
And now for the first 20 minutes,

160
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,080
we'll be looking at the intro.

161
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,040
So you have the link to the intro also

162
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,600
in the collaborative notes.

163
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,600
And yes, and it's also linked from the site.

164
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,920
So if you go to the schedule where you can find

165
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,280
exactly what we will be showing now,

166
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,560
and from the schedule,

167
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,240
you can also find every day's materials

168
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,680
that we'll be going through.

169
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,080
So the schedule is a good page to have open on the sites.

170
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
So first, why are we actually here?

171
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
So what is this about?

172
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,040
So code refinery is not the general coding class,

173
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,040
but it's everything or a lot of things beyond that.

174
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,440
So we will not be talking about how to code something

175
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
in a specific language,

176
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,680
but we will go through things that help you

177
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,880
around the actual writing code.

178
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Like this picture shows you very nicely.

179
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
That's by our friend Heidi Seibold.

180
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
And we always like to use it because it shows

181
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
like the six helpful steps to reproducible research.

182
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,840
And that's basically where all of our lessons fit in somehow.

183
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,760
So we talk about getting your files and folders in order.

184
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,400
How do you do that?

185
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
How do you use good names, files, folders, and functions?

186
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Documenting from README to something more extensive

187
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,640
and when that might be needed.

188
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
We will talk about version control a lot

189
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,120
now the first three days in particular.

190
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,480
And then we'll also talk about stabilizing

191
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,560
the computing environment and software,

192
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,080
and then how to publish your research outputs.

193
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,520
And here it's in particular about code.

194
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,080
So what's code refinery?

195
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,400
We are a Nordic project that are teaching these kind

196
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
of basic scientific computing tools.

197
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,320
We are funded by the Nordic infrastructure collaboration

198
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,000
and our partner organizations.

199
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
And a bit below you can see our current partners.

200
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,920
We are actually starting our fourth phase in May.

201
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,600
And we have existed since 2016

202
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,920
and have been running workshops since then.

203
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,360
We are running this workshop and we are also running

204
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,480
others like it.

205
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,200
For example, Python for scientific computing.

206
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,880
We have been doing tools and techniques for HPC

207
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,200
was one of the collaboration projects that we were doing.

208
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
So if that's all sounds interesting,

209
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,240
please go on our website and check out

210
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,040
all of the other materials as well.

211
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,360
And we are also a community of research software enthusiasts

212
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,440
and you can join that and more about that later.

213
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,920
But for now, practical matters, how to attend.

214
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,800
You may have already found out

215
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,000
that this is not your usual workshop.

216
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,520
So we're not all in a Zoom room,

217
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,080
but we are talking to you via a stream.

218
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,640
That also means that we don't have a Zoom chat

219
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
where you can interact like you are maybe used to.

220
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,600
But instead of that, we have our collaborative document.

221
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,840
So how this will work is that everyone,

222
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,320
no matter if you're doing this on your own or with a team

223
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,840
or with a group of strangers in some place,

224
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,120
you will watch the live stream

225
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,320
and there will be instructors talking and showing demos.

226
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,200
And in week one, we will also have exercises

227
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
where we will be quiet on stream.

228
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
We will give you some time to run through the exercises.

229
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,200
Almost all of them, or most of them have also solutions.

230
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,320
So you can go through them also yourself.

231
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,120
And you can always ask questions

232
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
whenever they come up during exercises, during classes,

233
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,280
the teaching, and also a little bit after the workshop still.

234
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,520
And we will not have any dedicated team exercises in week two,

235
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,840
but more interaction via the collaborative notes.

236
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,800
And the materials for week two

237
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,880
will also include exercise materials,

238
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,680
which you can run through on your own pace after the workshop.

239
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,000
We plan to have a minimum of 10 minutes break every hour,

240
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,360
and the materials are always available

241
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,280
for everyone.

242
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
And they're linked from the workshop page.

243
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
And all the recordings will be available on Twitch

244
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,040
right after the workshop.

245
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,920
So don't worry if you need to go for an hour or so

246
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,120
to do something else, you can always come back

247
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,560
and then re-watch the part that you missed right away on Twitch.

248
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,240
Or also we try to put all the recordings on YouTube

249
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,640
latest the day after the workshop.

250
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,080
And there will be a playlist with the 2025 workshop.

251
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,680
The collaborative document [name] and [name]

252
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,960
have already shown it a little bit.

253
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,080
Maybe we can switch there now as well.

254
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,160
So everyone who registered got at least one,

255
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,680
probably more emails from [name] with all the links

256
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,680
where you've found also this link to this stream.

257
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,320
And then there was also a link to the notes.

258
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
And that's this one.

259
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,760
So there is a lot of information in the top.

260
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,200
There's also a suggestion on,

261
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,480
how you can set up your laptop screen

262
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,080
to be able to watch what we are doing.

263
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,560
And at the same time do exercises and have the notes open.

264
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
So we are sharing in this kind of,

265
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,400
you may have noticed this narrow format

266
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
to enable you to have multiple things

267
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,400
even on a small laptop screen.

268
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,800
One important note on the notes,

269
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,000
please do not put any names or any other identifying

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,640
information on this page,

271
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,320
because as you see, we will be showing it on stream

272
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,280
and we will also be archiving it later.

273
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,360
In case there is some identifying information

274
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
or something, we will remove that before archiving,

275
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,200
but it will still be visible on stream.

276
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,560
But please don't hesitate to ask any kind of questions.

277
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,960
This is an anonymous document.

278
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,760
Your name is not visible by default.

279
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,440
And how you edit this document is that you have to find

280
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,880
now this little pen symbol, and it might be,

281
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,760
up there where it is on our screen,

282
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,160
or it might be somewhere on the left together

283
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,680
with some other symbols,

284
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,960
but it's always this little pen symbol.

285
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,640
And that switches you to the edit mode of this document.

286
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,440
And the document itself is markdown based,

287
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,160
but you don't really have to worry about it.

288
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
So you can just write plain text

289
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,680
as you have been doing here already in the icebreaker.

290
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,800
And if you haven't answered the icebreaker yet,

291
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
now is a very good time to also get used to the collaboration

292
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:25,120
collaborative document and tell us what's the weather like where you are.

293
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,120
And hopefully there's also some people sending a little bit of sunshine.

294
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,880
Then there's also another icebreaker,

295
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,280
which introduces one way of how we can do polls with this collaborative notes,

296
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,000
meaning we have a question and then you can answer your option by

297
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,640
adding an O to your option.

298
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,320
Then we will also use this document to distribute links.

299
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,320
Like I mentioned, the links are also all available from the schedule,

300
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,120
but we will also share them in the collaborative notes and always put

301
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,520
sections in that you always know where we are.

302
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,120
And during exercises and breaks, we will also write here

303
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,240
when we will be back on stream and when it will continue.

304
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
So you always know what's going

305
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,640
on. So if you have to leave, just scroll all the way down to the

306
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,040
collaborative notes and then you'll see where we are at at the moment.

307
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,640
Let me just check that I haven't forgotten anything.

308
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,840
Sometimes

309
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,560
you might have to refresh or update the document to get all the latest

310
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,120
information, especially if there's many people editing at the same time.

311
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,440
We recommend that whenever you're not typing,

312
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,360
then you go into this view mode, which is indicated by this little eye symbol.

313
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,320
Again, it might be up to the right or somewhere up to the left

314
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,080
to have like the nicely rendered version of this document where you can follow

315
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,000
everything that's happening and only whenever you write a question or add

316
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,360
anything to our polls, you go into the edit mode.

317
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Yes.

318
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,120
So then back to the intro material,

319
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,000
the practical setup for the workshop.

320
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,360
So we recommend that you create a directory for this workshop on your

321
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,560
computer so that it's easy later to clean up.

322
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,040
That can be wherever you want to have it.

323
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,080
There will be then some exercise materials in there and so on so that you have it all

324
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,400
in one place and can easily handle or move it around or remove.

325
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,320
After the workshop, you can put it all into one screen arrangement.

326
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,000
I already talked a little bit about this.

327
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,440
We have this narrow theater mode for Twitch,

328
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,680
so you can also hide the chat and choose this theater mode on your laptop.

329
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
And then you can have the lesson notes,

330
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,080
materials, your terminal or your Visual Studio code or whatever you're using for

331
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,400
the exercises there and watch everything at the same.

332
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
At the same time.

333
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,120
But on that note, we also are aware that there is a lot of things to follow.

334
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,600
So we have the Twitch stream.

335
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,280
We have the lesson materials.

336
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,560
There might be different things be shown on stream.

337
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,960
So what we would suggest is that the live stream is the first priority.

338
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,880
So that's where the teaching is going to happen.

339
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,440
Then the collaborative documents you can use to find info,

340
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,280
like the link to the exercises that are happening right now.

341
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,120
Or when the break ends or this or if whenever you have a questions.

342
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,680
Otherwise, you don't have to follow everything because I said it will be

343
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,040
it will be archived and you will be able to access it also after the workshop.

344
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,520
So no worries of missing anything there.

345
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,840
And then the lesson materials web page you can have open and use as needed.

346
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,080
So the instructors will show most of this on stream, but sometimes it might be nice

347
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,400
to just copy paste something from there or

348
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,200
look look a little bit further up than where the instructors are currently showing on stream.

349
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,280
OK, then.

350
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Some things that can and

351
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,360
potentially will go wrong in this workshop.

352
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,480
So one very important thing is I hope you can all hear me all right.

353
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,080
If that ever is not the case, because we have many different instructors coming here during

354
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,320
the week, we are trying to have the audio balanced and a good audio quality.

355
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,320
But if that's ever not the case or if there is some screen not visible,

356
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,120
if you notice an instructor is talking about something that you are not seeing

357
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,560
on the stream, please let us know.

358
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,120
And the collaborative notes is the way to do that.

359
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,920
So write it in the bottom of the collaborative notes.

360
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,240
If either the quality is bad, too loud, too low

361
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,240
and

362
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,240
anything like that's happening,

363
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,680
we may deviate from the schedule.

364
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,960
We will try to stay on track as good as we can.

365
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,080
But sometimes things just take a little bit wiser.

366
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,440
Then we'll try to catch up.

367
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,040
The collaborative document may lag a little bit.

368
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,320
I mentioned already then just wait a moment.

369
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,040
It will probably calm down after a moment.

370
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,920
Suddenly dies.

371
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,400
That might happen when [name]'s computer crashed.

372
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,840
Then it's about five minutes time until it comes back.

373
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:01,400
So don't worry. Go have a quick coffee and then we'll resume in about five minutes.

374
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:10,120
If you have any tool not set up, if you have any issues with the with the tool,

375
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,200
then don't worry.

376
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,040
You can watch the stream.

377
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,320
And just like follow along or think along and then do the installation after the

378
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,560
workshop and then do the exercises then as well.

379
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,960
So we have a big bunch of installation instructions.

380
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,480
They're also linked from here again.

381
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,640
That's better than trying to fix it on the go.

382
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,440
You can't attend every day. That's also fine.

383
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,880
You can attend only the parts that you are interested in.

384
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,600
The materials are always available.

385
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
The videos are always

386
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,680
available so you can catch up.

387
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,760
And also all the lessons in week two, for example, are self-contained.

388
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,960
So you can you can like join whichever session is of interest to you.

389
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,720
Who is here today?

390
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:06,480
We have about ten course coordinators, instructors and facilitators for this

391
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:13,000
workshop, you'll get to know them during the whole of this and next week.

392
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,040
Many are

393
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
research software engineers.

394
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,480
And if that sounds something that is interesting to you, we'll be talking a

395
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,160
little bit more about that also in the workshop outro on day six.

396
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,080
We have over 350 actually now registered

397
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,960
participants from over 20 different countries, which is very exciting.

398
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,640
And we also have learners from all levels and backgrounds.

399
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,680
And with that also just a word on that.

400
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,040
So everyone here is on different

401
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,520
level and that's expected people may come here in the beginning of their Ph.D.

402
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,600
while still studying as a professor or in any kind of

403
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,080
situation that they found out about this workshop.

404
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,360
And that's fine.

405
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,800
And it's expected and everyone will be learning different things.

406
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,160
And it's completely fine to just lean back and enjoy the show like you don't have

407
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,200
to do any exercises, this is like up to you, however you learn best.

408
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,800
Everyone can be both a teacher and a learner.

409
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,080
So if you see a question in the collaborative notes that you can answer,

410
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,560
go ahead and help us answering in many occasions.

411
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,200
It's also quite interesting to see different opinions.

412
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,720
Big question is always like, what's the best editor, for example?

413
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,240
And if you have an opinion about that, then please chime in to these kind of questions.

414
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,880
And yeah, let us know in the collaborative

415
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,160
document if something isn't going right and if it's a bigger question,

416
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:55,320
a bigger technical issue or something, it's always OK to say that we can discuss later.

417
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,920
In the worst case and if you find there is a problem with someone,

418
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,320
either an instructor or a fellow learner, we have a code of conduct on our web page

419
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,840
and there's also a form where you can let us know about anything that might have

420
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,840
happened there.

421
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,760
OK.

422
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,800
And then final notes from me for today,

423
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,120
please register if you haven't yet, because then you will get the link

424
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,440
to the collaborative notes and you can be in contact with the instructors.

425
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,400
You can ask questions

426
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,520
and you will get also all the wrap up emails of each day and the preparation

427
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,280
instructions for the next day.

428
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,040
And the link is also here to a workshop web page where you can also find the

429
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,600
schedule and the links to all materials.

430
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,640
I mentioned already about the collaborative notes.

431
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,600
If you want a certificate for this workshop,

432
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,840
there are instructions also on our web page.

433
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,240
You can go there and check that out

434
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,560
and follow the instructions there.

435
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,440
And Code Refinery is an open project, so you can join if this is something

436
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,920
that seems very interesting to you.

437
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,960
We always need volunteers and partners to continue with this workshop.

438
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,560
So if after this workshop you're saying, this is so cool and I want to know more

439
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,840
and I want to want to help with this, you're very welcome to join.

440
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:30,880
We have a whole page called join us where you can find whatever way fits you best.

441
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,720
And then we also have our support at Code Refinery dot org email address

442
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,840
where you can send any questions regarding the workshop or the project as well.

443
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,600
And as a last thing, we are also on social media,

444
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,920
Mastodon, Blue Sky, LinkedIn, and we are always super happy to read

445
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,360
any experiences from the workshops.

446
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:03,040
And with that, I will give to [name] and [name] starting with the workshop.

447
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,120
Have fun. Bye bye.

448
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,200
Hello, let me get set up here.

449
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,840
So on the notes, we had a few questions.

450
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:34,000
So setting up the directory for the files and stuff like for storing all

451
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,840
the stuff from the workshop, we will talk more about that when we get there.

452
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,840
But it's not an issue until

453
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,800
tomorrow, so don't worry too much.

454
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,040
And yes, so like [name] said, we store, we have the recordings.

455
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Okay, sorry.

456
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Let me try to share my screen on this other computer.

457
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,040
Hmm.

458
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,120
Okay.

459
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,960
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff for the streaming when I'm both talking and doing.

460
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,880
Okay. Yeah.

461
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:26,120
So it's me, [name], and my co-teacher, [name].

462
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,120
And we're here for the first part of the

463
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,720
workshop, which is the introduction to version control.

464
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,760
Yeah, I love everyone.

465
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,800
So, yeah, so I'm a staff scientist at Aalto

466
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,800
University working in what's essentially the high performance computing and

467
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,040
research software engineer team and I'm [name].

468
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm an application expert at Upmux and nice in Sweden.

469
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,840
Very happy to be teaching it for you together with [name].

470
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Yeah.

471
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,120
So let's see.

472
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,840
So if we start on our schedule here,

473
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,640
and we scroll down or the course page, we scroll down to the schedule.

474
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,800
Note that the schedule translates the times to what the browser thinks is your

475
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,960
time zone, so don't get confused with that.

476
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,800
And we come to introduction to version control.

477
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,680
I'll open that and switch here.

478
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,120
So, yes, so this is where we all start.

479
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,840
So the whole workshop is somehow

480
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
all about version control.

481
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,640
So the first week is more using it.

482
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,720
And then the first week is more learning how to use it.

483
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,520
And the second week is really applying it in a lot of cases to really drive it in

484
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,240
and see how it can benefit the actual work.

485
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,360
So the first

486
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
week,

487
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,840
starting about a year ago, we reorganized the lesson sum.

488
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,520
So previously, we started from the command line and did everything in some

489
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,600
sort of like basic order, but now we have a different plan.

490
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,000
So now the general idea is the first day

491
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,680
we get used to just the concepts by using the GitHub web interface.

492
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,960
The second day we go to the command line or VS code on your own computer and we

493
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,840
repeat the same things and show sort of a more realistic working.

494
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,080
method where you're editing code and things locally.

495
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,160
And then on day three, we sort of combine them.

496
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:56,240
So we do some editing ourselves, but then we also do collaborative work.

497
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,600
So we use GitHub and then we all contribute to the same exercise

498
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,320
repositories and practice making bigger projects.

499
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,440
But every day you'll see in the lessons we have these tabs where you can choose.

500
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,880
Do you want

501
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,440
to try to do the exercise from the GitHub web interface or from the command line or

502
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
from VS code or from R studio?

503
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,680
And I think that's the main options, but there might be even more added later.

504
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,600
Yeah, exactly.

505
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,760
And if you already have a preferred ID that has integrated, you're free to use that.

506
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,320
So that's that's perfectly fine.

507
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,800
Yeah.

508
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,880
Yeah, so that's a.

509
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,840
Yeah, so so even though we have

510
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,280
this general workflow, you can look at the other things and try

511
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,880
to get a preview of what comes before or use the older method

512
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,120
like the GitHub web interface if you're not set up for the local work.

513
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,680
There's a lot of options here and we'll

514
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,160
try to make it clear what you should be doing at each point of time.

515
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,840
So with that being said, are there any other starting notes before we begin?

516
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,080
Let's see.

517
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
Yeah.

518
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,880
So just to mention that today you only need a GitHub account and a way to actually

519
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,720
sign into your GitHub account and you can follow along just using that.

520
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,840
So no need to have VS code or or anything else set up.

521
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,120
Right. Yeah.

522
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,720
And I guess at the end of the day, we should talk a little bit about how to prepare for day two.

523
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
Yeah. Yes.

524
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,040
Okay.

525
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,160
Let's not forget that.

526
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:49,680
So with that being said, I will scroll down a little bit and we begin with motivation.

527
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,960
Yeah, [name], so tell us, why do we actually want version control?

528
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,640
Well, my favorite example was part of the icebreaker.

529
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,120
So the fact that several times a year,

530
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:10,000
my friends, as in people that I would think would know version control, come to me and say, yeah,

531
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,600
I've just lost some code I've done.

532
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:22,000
And now I have to go spend a lot of time to figure it out or make it again or whatever.

533
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,080
And it's just a bit unfortunate.

534
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,880
Like, I feel bad for them, but also I understand because I've been in those places, too.

535
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:37,520
I used to often lose my code because I didn't have this code time machine to go back or I did.

536
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,000
But I only wanted to use it when it was.

537
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Perfect.

538
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,360
And not when it was.

539
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,960
There

540
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,760
are not when not all the time, but let's see.

541
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,400
So basically what we get here when we.

542
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Scroll down on this page, it is about keeping track of changes

543
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,920
and the changes are what makes the time machine.

544
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:10,000
So, for example, this is a screenshot from the GitHub Web interface and you see here there's

545
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,920
dates, so

546
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:19,160
something made on June 22nd, 2023, October 21st, 2021 and so on.

547
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:27,120
Going back, we see a quick description of what it is, who did it and then

548
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,520
some other things so we can copy link and identifier for it and things like that.

549
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,560
So this is the history actually of a GitHub repository.

550
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,920
Yes, correct.

551
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,520
And this is our ultimate goal.

552
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,120
So once we have the history in the structured form, it becomes really easy

553
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,200
to say, oh, I want to go back to what we had in twenty eighteen

554
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,000
and see if it's any different than what we have now and so on.

555
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,840
So by the end of today, we hope that you can make one of these

556
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,760
histories yourself and understand why it's useful.

557
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,840
And when we scroll down more, this is what it looks like from the

558
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,640
command line from the terminal.

559
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,520
So it's the same kind of information.

560
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:22,800
We see a commit ID, author, name, description of it, and it sort of goes on down.

561
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,920
Same data.

562
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
So why do we keep track of versions?

563
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,560
I think this is probably something I've already said, but.

564
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,880
Yeah, I mean, basically.

565
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,680
If you want, you can see all kinds of

566
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:46,280
problems here, which you probably heard before or will hear here in your career,

567
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,720
but which can be easily answered with having this kind of history.

568
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,800
Are there any here that are especially bad?

569
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,600
This my laptop is gone.

570
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,960
Where's my thesis gone?

571
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,360
That's I mean, I remember here.

572
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,840
Yeah, like when I was doing my thesis, I remember hearing stories of

573
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,120
yeah, my laptop's been stolen and my thesis is gone and just like, well, nothing to do.

574
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,560
So I was very how would you say it?

575
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,160
Strict in using version control and pushing it to make a copy on another server.

576
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,720
So I know that no matter what happens to my laptop, I'd be able to get all that stuff back.

577
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,480
And there's plenty more.

578
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,480
I think that identifying a version that authors use in a certain paper is very useful.

579
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,600
As I mean, especially with the larger

580
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,000
software that is being developed constantly and new features being added,

581
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,200
it's important to know what exactly has been used in a different in a certain version.

582
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,480
Yeah.

583
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,240
So, yeah, that's important.

584
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,760
And we'll teach you actually how you can refer to a particular version of your code

585
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,480
or repository doesn't have to be code.

586
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,120
It can be whatever really.

587
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Okay.

588
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,120
Well, that reminds me.

589
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,000
So when talking about an old version of the paper,

590
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,680
one thing I usually hear people complaining about is I've got my

591
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,840
paper reviews back and now I need to do some updates.

592
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,480
But they've kept working on their code for other projects and now they can't

593
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,520
reproduce what's in the paper anymore and they're getting different things.

594
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,560
And that's just

595
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,320
well, tragic, maybe like,

596
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,320
how how is it different?

597
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,960
So we have to think something's probably improved there.

598
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:51,040
But if you can't easily find it, then how can you be confident in what you've got?

599
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,360
So once we have this version control, it's not just the history.

600
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,400
So there's other things.

601
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,440
So rollback is kind of obvious.

602
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,040
So we have an old version we want to go to and we can say revert me to that version.

603
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,200
We can also do branching and work on two things at the same

604
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,320
time, merging and collaboration.

605
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,440
So, for example, if you have a project where you're working with multiple people,

606
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,040
two people add different features as represented by the hat and sunglasses.

607
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,840
And you can combine them later.

608
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,440
I have a feeling that part of the how would you say, not problem,

609
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,800
but like one of the barriers to good scientific collaboration is that it's hard

610
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,360
to share code like this.

611
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,280
Many people aren't good at it.

612
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,800
So you end up having two copies of the code and they don't really sync.

613
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,200
I know that's been a problem with some of my previous collaborators before.

614
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Yeah, so a bit on branching, so one can see branching as a kind of like

615
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,600
a different line of work for the same code, maybe a new feature that you're

616
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,920
trying to implement and you don't want to keep it in your main branches.

617
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,320
You're maybe not sure if that's something

618
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,760
that's something actually you want to keep.

619
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,000
So you can view all the so you can view

620
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,600
the sunglasses as like a feature that that your project may have.

621
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,080
And you will show you later how you can

622
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,560
actually merge these together on your main branch.

623
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,160
If if you're happy with it.

624
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,640
Yeah.

625
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,240
So kind of like an experimentation.

626
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,240
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,480
Okay.

628
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,360
Once we have this more reproducible, just like with the paper review thing,

629
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,640
so you can understand where all the changes are.

630
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,600
So this view here, I guess the picture is kind of small,

631
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,360
and I can't really zoom in.

632
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,760
You can open the link, browse this example online,

633
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,560
and then it's going to have it.

634
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,560
Oh, this works very nice.

635
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
This works.

636
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,680
So what we see here on the right side is all the code.

637
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:20,960
And on the left side, we see exactly when each line of code was last edited.

638
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,640
So this is a file that has been opened.

639
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:31,240
One file in this repository called NetworkX.

640
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,680
Yeah.

641
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,280
I mean, what you see in the code doesn't matter right now.

642
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,800
So this is just an example.

643
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,480
We're going to go into more depth for all of these things later on.

644
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,920
Who's ever wanted to send someone a bit of code so they can see it,

645
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:56,320
but it's annoying to attach it to an email and tell them where to look or copy and paste.

646
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,200
With GitHub, we can do things like paste it into

647
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,480
like paste a link that highlights a certain bit of code.

648
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,080
How do we use Git?

649
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,200
What do we use it for?

650
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,160
So obviously there's code and software.

651
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,840
There's other scripts.

652
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,400
There's documents.

653
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,040
For example, if you're writing a paper in LaTeX, it works really well there.

654
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:28,640
But even other files that aren't plain text files, you can, in theory, track with version control.

655
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,880
Configuration file, website sources.

656
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,280
This lesson.

657
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,960
Itself that you're reading now is itself tracked in version control.

658
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,880
So you could say that the whole workshop is a lesson in how to use

659
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:51,880
the teaching tools in the workshop if you want to be recursive about it.

660
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,080
One question.

661
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,560
So what would be the advantage of actually using version control like it instead of

662
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,280
using different zip files which are dated?

663
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,280
Yeah.

664
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,720
So, yeah, you could always go and make a backup copy manually like this where you

665
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,920
basically, well, are archiving different things.

666
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,680
But with all these archives, you can go back to a certain time.

667
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,360
But what if you want to see what the differences are?

668
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,560
That's sort of hard.

669
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,240
What if you want to compare over time?

670
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,480
What if you want to see what's in each of these?

671
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,400
What if you want to search for a certain change you've made and so on?

672
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,000
That's more difficult.

673
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,080
So this is better than nothing.

674
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,960
But compared to being able to run one command and save all your work in the same

675
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,600
place, it's not quite so convenient.

676
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,200
Yeah.

677
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,920
And one thing I would add, if you actually have a project which is quite large in

678
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:05,440
size, you don't want to make all these different copies of your project.

679
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:12,680
This actually is going to save only one version of one change to a file.

680
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,080
So it's going to keep

681
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:24,760
so it's going to ensure that your tracked project is actually light in size.

682
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,040
Yeah.

683
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,960
Yeah.

684
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,000
One big advantage, especially for big projects.

685
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:30,920
Yeah.

686
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,440
And this provides nothing with the branching and merging and things like that.

687
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,600
If I send someone a zip archive and they work on it, now I have two zip archives

688
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,360
and that's a bigger problem.

689
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,800
So.

690
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,280
Yeah.

691
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,800
But we know that not everything is perfect, so there are difficulties.

692
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,600
And the point of our lesson here is to try to make it easier.

693
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,400
So it's another thing to learn.

694
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:04,080
But I think everyone here would agree that it's well worth the time spent to learn

695
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,240
it.

696
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,600
If you want to do anything else in your career with code and so on, it's better

697
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,040
to learn quickly.

698
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,480
If you have collaborators that don't want to use version control, well,

699
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,680
I'm sorry, but, you know, that is a pretty common thing.

700
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,680
When I was doing my academic work,

701
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,880
it was always hard to find someone that wanted to take the time to do it.

702
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,040
But I mean, if you help them, maybe they will begin working.

703
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,680
I've often done a thing where I've had version control of a manuscript

704
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:45,400
and I would send my advisor a copy by email, but I would track locally

705
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,520
what version they last got so I can merge it myself on my end.

706
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,400
And this last point here about advanced

707
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:01,640
things being difficult is definitely a bit of a problem somehow.

708
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,440
But I think that our philosophy here is that

709
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,480
the basic things should be easy and don't worry about the advanced things.

710
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,680
Even if you use Git in the most basic way,

711
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,640
it will save you time compared to other things.

712
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,840
And you don't need to worry about advanced stuff.

713
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:24,280
So we are really trying to make this a user friendly and practical starting course.

714
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,240
And to be honest, when you need to do something advanced

715
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,440
and you don't know, you can ask someone else or learn it when you need to.

716
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,320
There's no need to for everyone to know everything.

717
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,200
Yeah, exactly.

718
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,400
I think, I mean, it is so beneficial if you just even if you use it in a very basic

719
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,800
way, so you don't have to know all the commands.

720
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,400
I don't know all the commands.

721
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,920
You can just take it slow,

722
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,000
learn to do some things, and then you'll grow from there.

723
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,720
So there is no need to learn everything from the beginning.

724
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,160
Yeah.

725
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,640
And there are other things besides Git for version control, but

726
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,560
we focus on Git because it's the most popular one,

727
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,080
which means that it's in the most places already.

728
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,040
And well, in the end,

729
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,280
teaching the more common thing is more

730
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,520
useful because that's what you're more likely to use.

731
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,840
We want to be practical and not pedantic.

732
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,400
But it does have some good features like the distributed nature,

733
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,560
although it's not the only one that's distributed.

734
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,200
Right now.

735
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,240
So with that being said,

736
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,960
should we check the notes and see if there's any questions?

737
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,800
Yes.

738
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
There should be a motivation section here.

739
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,480
Most of these, is there a limit to the size of files and documents?

740
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,800
No, not really.

741
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,360
I mean,

742
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,800
there's only the practical limit of how big of stuff you want to control.

743
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,040
Yeah, maybe.

744
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,160
So one good point is that

745
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:21,240
if you have the repository on your laptop, then it's not really a size limit.

746
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,160
But if you put things on a different platform like on GitHub or GitLab or

747
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,760
anywhere else, there may be a limit for private repository.

748
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,800
Private repository.

749
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,720
So that is something that you may want to consider.

750
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,640
There is no limit, as I know, for public ones.

751
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,640
But if you are not ready to share it

752
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,360
with the world yet, then there may be some limits there.

753
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,880
And there is actually one link in the answer there.

754
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,840
So you may check.

755
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,680
And this also, so this limit actually changes over time.

756
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,720
So I think, well, one is more and more, I mean, this usually goes higher.

757
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,080
And higher over time.

758
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,600
Yeah.

759
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,680
Storage.

760
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,320
There's a really good question here.

761
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,720
Number nine, can I use Git for Word and PowerPoint?

762
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,520
So it's, I wouldn't even, it's designed for code and text files,

763
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,520
but you can store any kind of files in there.

764
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,520
So Git would look at the Word and PowerPoint things as just binary documents.

765
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,720
And you don't get things like the

766
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,360
differences and merging to look so good.

767
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,200
But I've done this before when I've worked

768
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,280
with people who want to write a paper and they're only using Word.

769
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,400
I have my own private repository where I'm tracking things.

770
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,840
And you can also use extensions that let

771
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,560
you show differences between versions and things like that.

772
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah, exactly.

773
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,080
So the difference between GitHub and GitLab.

774
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,640
I think that's probably being

775
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,800
answered there and we'll answer it later.

776
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,480
So maybe we should go on.

777
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,120
Yeah.

778
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:14,720
So I think, yeah, everyone wants to know how they actually get to work with Git.

779
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,600
So maybe I'm going to get the screen share from you.

780
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:25,360
And let's look further into a repository.

781
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,920
And we are going to start with a repository on GitHub.

782
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,640
So I hope you can all see my screen here.

783
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,880
So you find this lesson.

784
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,640
So we are going to continue with modifying an existing project.

785
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,840
And I'm going to now zoom this in.

786
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,920
And the very first thing is copy and browse an existing project.

787
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,880
And as I said, we are going to look at something which is stored on GitHub.

788
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,720
And what we will be doing is to make a copy.

789
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,360
Of an existing one that we have prepared for you.

790
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,800
And in GitHub terms, when I say making a copy, what I mean is making a so-called

791
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,240
fork of this repository and the one note here.

792
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,080
So usually when we refer to a repository,

793
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:27,160
so a copy of our project on a cloud platform like GitHub, we usually refer to it as a remote.

794
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,680
So if you see remote, then think of it as a repository in the cloud.

795
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:43,640
So what we're doing now, are we looking at GitHub to see something that exists?

796
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,320
And we make our own copy, which is the fork.

797
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,440
Exactly.

798
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,560
And we will share exactly which repository we look at.

799
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:59,760
And throughout these lessons on Git, there will be different ways you can follow this along.

800
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,360
Some parts can only be done on GitHub.

801
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:11,880
But other times you can do this via the command line or using other IDEs like

802
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,560
VS Code or other IDEs which have Git integrated.

803
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,840
But what we'll do in this first lesson is to show you how you can do it on GitHub.

804
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:32,680
And throughout the lesson, I'll let you know if other options are actually more suitable for the things that we do.

805
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,080
But again, now we'll be focusing on GitHub.

806
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,880
So the first thing we will do is to create a copy of an existing repository.

807
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,880
So create a fork of this repository.

808
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:53,280
And so think of, again, I mean, as there is a repository as copies,

809
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,680
different copies taken at different times of our project.

810
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,680
And the project we will be working with is called Recipe Book.

811
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:11,880
And it's under a GitHub user organization, which is called CR Workshop Exercises on GitHub.

812
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:19,080
And so what we'll do by forking is to make another copy of this repository.

813
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,080
So with all these different commits and branches that it may have,

814
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,080
but not residing in this user space, but in our own user space.

815
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,880
And so we'll copy this

816
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:41,200
under our own organization or user space on GitHub.

817
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:48,760
So which is the repository that we are going to copy or fork?

818
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,560
So it's this one here.

819
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:58,200
So github.com CR Workshop Exercise Recipe book.

820
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,000
So you may just open this.

821
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,640
This in in a browser and

822
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,000
for the sake of.

823
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,960
So I will be working with this repository instead,

824
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,640
which at this point is identical with Recipe Book.

825
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:21,320
And the reason is because, well, I don't want some some

826
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,520
other usernames to want to show up as we are now streaming this.

827
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,520
But no worries, these two repositories are identical.

828
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,240
At this point.

829
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,280
So I am going to open this in a new tab and go to that tab.

830
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,320
It's a bit tricky.

831
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,600
Yes, so so I have CR Workshop Exercises Recipe book recorded

832
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:53,600
and I am going to just check a little bit what this repository is is all about.

833
01:02:53,800 --> 01:03:00,280
So I will just decrease the font size a bit so that you see that.

834
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,640
This looks a little bit I mean,

835
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,600
being zoomed out, you lose some of the information that is on the page.

836
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,240
But basically we have a content

837
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,720
of the repository.

838
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,360
So all the files and directories that we are tracking with git.

839
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:25,240
Then we have some information about about the repository by default.

840
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,440
GitHub is actually going to show the content of the readme file.

841
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,640
And it's usually nice to have a readme

842
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,720
file for your repository so that people know, oh, what is this all about?

843
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:44,320
So this is just a repository that tracks different recipes and it's categorized.

844
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,320
Well, they are all stored into different directories, and I can see that if I go

845
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,960
to these different directories, then I may find different files.

846
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,720
So so what we are going to do now is actually

847
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,920
not to work in this repository.

848
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:07,760
And why, you know, why, why, why wouldn't I want to work on this repository?

849
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,120
Yeah, so this reminds me like what you're

850
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,080
showing here seems like something I do quite often.

851
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,400
So there's some new project, new code.

852
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:22,400
And I want to see, OK, like, do I want to use this person's project in my own work?

853
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:28,600
So I go there and first I'll browse it and see what's in there.

854
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:34,080
And then I decide, yes, OK, I want to try using this myself

855
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,000
and maybe I want to modify it.

856
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,560
But I guess I can't modify someone else's work on GitHub.

857
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,000
So I make my own copy.

858
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,240
Yeah, and that's what is going to happen here.

859
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,520
So what we are going to do is to fork this repository.

860
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,400
So make our own copy of this repository.

861
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,920
And actually, GitHub is very smart in showing

862
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:04,960
what different tabs do if you just hover over with the

863
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,280
mouse over them. So I'm going to click on this fork.

864
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,760
So I click on fork.

865
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,280
And again, I mean, you should not use this

866
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,320
recipe book recorded, but you should use the recipe book.

867
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,920
So then I am prompted to choosing an owner.

868
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,120
So under which

869
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,320
user space do I want to have this copy

870
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,640
of this repository? And I'm going to choose mine.

871
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:39,720
OK, first I'm going to rename this because I already have a copy of this repository.

872
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,960
I'm going to call it 25.

873
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,080
And so let's choose.

874
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,960
Oh, I cannot fork twice.

875
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,880
OK, maybe I should remove my other fork.

876
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,120
Oh, OK.

877
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,200
Yeah, this is.

878
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,240
So bear with me.

879
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,680
So what I'm going to do.

880
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,200
I'm going to delete my other fork.

881
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,680
So basically what happened is when you were practicing.

882
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,600
Exactly.

883
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:19,320
And I wanted to do that because I, you know, I pushed something.

884
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,240
So then you know how to actually I'm going to click on settings.

885
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,120
No.

886
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,120
Oh, this is a bit.

887
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,200
These settings.

888
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,200
And somewhere here there should be a danger zone.

889
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,400
And then I'm going to click delete this repository.

890
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,400
And you should be certain this is what you want to do because there is no going back.

891
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:50,200
And then so this is a bit more advanced than.

892
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,480
Then we intended.

893
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,680
At least.

894
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,520
Step.

895
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,400
You really need to be sure you want to remove repositories.

896
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,360
So, yes.

897
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,040
So sorry for this.

898
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:16,320
And then let's go back to to these original.

899
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,920
Repositories are for this, I have.

900
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,680
So, yes.

901
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,080
So now I'm going to fork this from C.

902
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,120
Our workshop exercises.

903
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:35,080
And I have the owner selected a reposter name, which I may keep the same or I may change.

904
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,800
And then the description is taken from the original repository.

905
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,960
And I'm going to keep that.

906
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:42,920
I think it's a good one.

907
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,200
And then I'm going to deselect this.

908
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:51,520
And the reason why I do this, because I want to copy all the branches that this

909
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,920
repository had and then click on creating.

910
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:03,080
So what then what happens is I'm going to have this recipe book in my under my

911
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,640
GitHub username and then it looks exactly the same.

912
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,520
I even get an information that this is a repository which has been forked from

913
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,280
another one, but the content is exactly the same.

914
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,480
The advantage is that I actually have control over this reposter.

915
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,760
I can change this as I want.

916
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,920
Do any modifications I may wish and share them back.

917
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,440
As we'll see later.

918
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,760
So, yeah.

919
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,200
So then this is yeah.

920
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,280
And this is possible because it's on GitHub and because it's public.

921
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,040
Could I do this with a private repository?

922
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,840
So

923
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,160
you can not do this with a private

924
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:53,480
repository unless you have you have permission to fork from that one.

925
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,000
So you have to be.

926
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:02,440
You may need to be added actually as a member to that.

927
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,880
OK,

928
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,840
to that repository before being able to fork.

929
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:08,760
Yeah, yeah.

930
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,000
So you still have the permission things going on here.

931
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,840
OK, yeah.

932
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,240
OK, OK, then so.

933
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:25,160
So, by the way, I'd like to say there's a emergency update of the notes document.

934
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,360
So it's offline right now.

935
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,160
I've been watching this in another chat, so don't don't panic if you can't ask

936
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:38,920
questions right now, but hopefully we will be back in five or 10 minutes.

937
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,880
Yeah, so then

938
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,640
so now that we have our fork.

939
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:53,120
What we are going to do is to investigate this repository that we have forked.

940
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,120
And one thing before we.

941
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,480
Do that. So these copy.

942
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,600
So now this repository that we have copied

943
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,680
from, we usually call it the upstream repository.

944
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,560
So it's just another fancy name, GitHub term for or a git term actually for

945
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,600
four repositories that we have copied from.

946
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,880
So upstream.

947
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:24,280
And and then so the exercise that we'll be doing in the following is to browse

948
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:31,560
through this fork that we have copied, investigate the commit history,

949
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,440
check, I mean, how we can find different different

950
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,720
different terms in in different files.

951
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,600
Check, I mean, who has modified the what in this repository?

952
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,200
And we are going to do this for 20 minutes, I think.

953
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,400
20 minutes and hopefully

954
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:04,800
the collaborative document is going to be back online fast so that you can get to

955
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,840
ask us questions, but yes, I'm going to time for a break.

956
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,800
Should we say maybe break plus exercise time?

957
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,600
Um.

958
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,120
And then.

959
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,680
Yes, so let's say that.

960
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,480
So break and exercise until

961
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,320
15 past or no, that's a bit short.

962
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,320
And that's 20 past to 20.

963
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,920
So that's.

964
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:42,040
10 minutes break and 15 minutes exercise.

965
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:47,280
I guess we can start with that, but the notes is working again.

966
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,720
OK, great. It works.

967
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,800
OK, cool.

968
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
If at any point you don't know what to do, please ask us.

969
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,160
It's in a collaborative document and.

970
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,680
And yeah, hopefully you will enjoy this first exercise.

971
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,040
Yeah.

972
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:09,240
OK, so we sent the notes and you can read further instructions there.

973
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,240
See you in a little bit.

974
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:13,760
Bye.

975
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:53,000


976
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:23,000


977
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:53,000


978
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:23,000


979
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:53,000


980
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:23,000


981
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:53,000


982
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:23,000


983
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:53,000


984
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:23,000


985
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:53,000


986
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:23,000


987
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:53,000


988
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:23,000


989
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:53,000


990
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:23,000


991
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:53,000


992
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:23,000


993
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:53,000


994
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:23,000


995
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:53,000


996
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:23,000


997
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:53,000


998
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:23,000


999
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:53,000


1000
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:23,000


1001
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:53,000


1002
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:23,000


1003
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:53,000


1004
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:23,000


1005
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:53,000


1006
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:23,000


1007
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:53,000


1008
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:23,000


1009
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:53,000


1010
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:23,000


1011
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:53,000


1012
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:23,000


1013
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:53,000


1014
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:23,000


1015
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:53,000


1016
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:23,000


1017
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:53,000


1018
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:23,000


1019
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:53,000


1020
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:23,000


1021
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:53,000


1022
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:23,000


1023
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:53,000


1024
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:23,000


1025
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:53,000


1026
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:23,000


1027
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:37,840
I hope it has been tricky because it's always tricky.

1028
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,720
Sorry, I did it wrong.

1029
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,760
Can you start again? I didn't start the audio properly.

1030
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,640
OK, OK.

1031
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,600
Yeah, we are back.

1032
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,040
Welcome back, everyone.

1033
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,920
I hope that you got to try the first exercise.

1034
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,720
I'm sure it has been a bit tricky,

1035
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:59,480
especially for those of you that are new to the GitHub interface.

1036
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:02,560
But but I was thinking that actually

1037
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:08,000
in the following minutes, I'm going to walk you through the solution.

1038
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:13,840
And so I am now in this repository again

1039
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:20,480
that I have forked the recipe book recorded and you are working with the recipe book

1040
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,960
one, that's OK.

1041
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:28,400
So the first thing that you were asked to do is to browse the commit history.

1042
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:36,600
So then one way to browse the history is to

1043
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,560
well, simply look at the.

1044
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,240
Oh, looks a bit different.

1045
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,520
Look at the commits.

1046
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:49,920
I'm going to move the make this a bit larger.

1047
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,920
So.

1048
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:59,200
So here I have,

1049
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:07,120
for example, the last the latest commit that has been done by us and

1050
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,120
[name], I have lost the commits.

1051
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:13,400
Where were they?

1052
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,080
It was supposed to be somewhere here.

1053
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,360
So

1054
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,120
the history, could it be the.

1055
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,480
The clock icon?

1056
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:25,520
Yes. Sorry.

1057
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:32,040
It's because whenever I have the the window smaller, then it just doesn't show everything.

1058
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:36,440
So I have the latest commit, which was done seven months back.

1059
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:42,240
And then clicking on this clock, then I can actually go and see not only

1060
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:47,920
the latest one, but all the all the commits that have been done for this repository.

1061
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,520
Let me scroll this back.

1062
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,640
So then if you remember from the

1063
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,000
motivation part.

1064
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,360
So I see

1065
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,640
the commit message.

1066
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:02,520
So this is actually what is shown in bold here.

1067
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:08,120
The time of the commit and the committer and also a hash.

1068
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:13,000
And actually, it's only part of the hash that each command has.

1069
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:21,240
So it's like a unique identifiable for a commit, which is think of it like like a snapshot of of the state

1070
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:24,000
of the repository at that particular time.

1071
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,920
So September 1st.

1072
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:30,760
And then I can see the whole history from the latest to the first commit.

1073
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,840
I can also change the branch.

1074
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:39,640
So there are different branches for this particular repository.

1075
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:46,600
There is a lasagna branch, which again, I mean, has its own history of commits.

1076
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,400
So this is one way of looking at the history.

1077
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:56,400
There is another feature that GitHub has in order to see the history of a repository.

1078
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:03,360
If you go here, so the top menu and then click on insights and then network,

1079
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:10,880
then there is a graphical visualization of of the repository.

1080
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,560
So I.

1081
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,160
So we have worked on the.

1082
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,400
Repository.

1083
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,240
So today, the 25th of March.

1084
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:27,480
So this whole history of commits is actually

1085
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:32,360
the one that has been on the original upstream repository.

1086
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:38,400
So the one we worked from and then and then there are some some new

1087
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:43,120
commits that I have introduced and we'll talk about them in the next episode.

1088
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:50,320
But so all this line, so the black one with the different circles, it's like one line of

1089
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:57,240
commits, one branch in this repository and time is going.

1090
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,920
So from left to right is increasing time.

1091
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:04,120
And then there is another branch here shown in blue,

1092
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:10,080
a branch which is called Alex Fruit Salad, which has a couple of commits.

1093
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:16,960
So it's a branch which has been formed at some point in time

1094
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:20,240
and then it got merged back.

1095
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,880
In version doesn't say the time.

1096
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:28,200
I think I have to zoom in a bit, but we'll show you exactly how you can

1097
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:34,280
actually form these branches and then merge them together in in the main one.

1098
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:38,640
So that's another way of looking at the history.

1099
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:43,840
So how can I actually find out when a recipe was last modified?

1100
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,840
So I go back to code.

1101
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,320
And let's pick up one.

1102
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,560
Recipe.

1103
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:57,160
So I go into one of the directories, let's see this vegetarian lasagna.

1104
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,920
So then sorry, let's get back.

1105
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:06,400
So I see that this particular file has been last modified.

1106
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:12,440
So so on the last commit date, some time last year, if I do open it,

1107
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:17,080
then I can also get a hash of of the commit.

1108
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,920
So it has been modified by

1109
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:25,640
Bust, which will tell you all about Collaborative Git, the third day.

1110
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:30,280
So and then what these are the contents.

1111
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:33,960
I can see the history, which will tell me

1112
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,120
all the different commits that actually modify this file.

1113
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:40,920
So it's not only the one on

1114
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,280
the fifth.

1115
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:47,080
It's not only this commit, but there has been some other changes before.

1116
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,080
So

1117
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,040
let's quickly see the guacamole recipe.

1118
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:56,520
So I go back to the

1119
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,040
so I go back to code.

1120
01:44:59,240 --> 01:44:59,880
So let's see.

1121
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,960
I actually do not know where the guacamole recipe is.

1122
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:09,480
Then I can click on this button, go to file and start typing guacamole.

1123
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:17,080
And then GitHub is going to search for this repository and open this file or that

1124
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,000
that

1125
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:24,160
well, in this case is the guacamole MD file.

1126
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:30,720
So what we were to do here is that to see how many changes this file had.

1127
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:35,720
And then again, as for the previous one, I'm going to click this history button.

1128
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:40,440
And I see there are several different commits by

1129
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,360
different

1130
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:49,000
committers. So both Bust and Jamie Garcia that has committed to

1131
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:55,000
that has introduced changes to this guacamole recipe and committed it.

1132
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,160
So

1133
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:04,120
step number five, which recipes include the ingredient salt.

1134
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:09,360
So, of course, if you don't many people had problems with this indexing.

1135
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,200
Yes, exactly.

1136
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,680
So

1137
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:17,080
there is a search button at the very top

1138
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,000
towards the right.

1139
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,760
Of of the page.

1140
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:27,000
So if you want, click that button, then I can search actually in many different

1141
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:32,760
repositories by default, GitHub is going to suggest that I search within this

1142
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:40,360
particular repository, but I can search through the entire GitHub.

1143
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,280
But by default, again, it's this it's this particular one.

1144
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:49,000
And then I'm instructed to search for recipes that include ingredients salt.

1145
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:51,240
So this is

1146
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:54,000
so GitHub actually needs to index the

1147
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:57,240
repository before it can actually search for it.

1148
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:03,440
So the very first time you do the search, it's it may take a couple of minutes.

1149
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:07,920
So as it does have to index this repository.

1150
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:12,960
So if I look for a search, I see that actually there are many recipes that include

1151
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:18,760
this term, so in salads mixed and sides and so on.

1152
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,360
So

1153
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,200
that is one way to search

1154
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,120
the contents of the files.

1155
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,560
So if you remember before

1156
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:33,360
clicking that button, go to clicking the button, go to file,

1157
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:38,640
which sometimes actually shows like a search button, it doesn't check the content,

1158
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:43,560
but it actually checks the name of the files which match a certain syntax.

1159
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,320
So it is different.

1160
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,880
So

1161
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:50,760
so

1162
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,760
so number six, again, we are going to go to the guacamole recipe,

1163
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,560
which I remember now it is in sides, guacamole.

1164
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:05,320
So let's say that I want actually to know who has

1165
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,400
edited this file and who.

1166
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:16,520
So we remember that if we check the history, then we got the

1167
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:22,440
the name of the committers for this file and when they have committed.

1168
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:26,880
But let's say that I actually want to know which changes they have introduced.

1169
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:34,440
So one way of doing that is by clicking on this

1170
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:38,120
name, sorry, on this tab called Blame.

1171
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:46,320
And this comes from the from the git blame command, which is actually similar to the git

1172
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,560
annotate command.

1173
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:52,320
So what it actually does is to

1174
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,800
to break this

1175
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:02,000
guacamole MD file into different lines and showing each lines have been modified by whom.

1176
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:06,280
So the top of the file has been

1177
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:10,880
changed by Bust.

1178
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:16,440
And and then and it also what says when and then again,

1179
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:22,760
I mean, there are different changes which have been introduced at different times.

1180
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:28,440
So it's going to show by default, so the last the

1181
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:35,840
so when a certain line or a group of lines have been modified last.

1182
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,200
OK, then, so

1183
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,240
can you actually use these recipes yourself?

1184
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:45,560
And this is something that we'll talk a lot.

1185
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,480
Well, we'll talk about next week.

1186
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,200
So licensing.

1187
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:57,400
What can you actually do with a repository that you have?

1188
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:01,800
So the important thing is to look at the license.

1189
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,440
And you can see this either

1190
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:12,560
on the right part of the repository or you can also

1191
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,320
find it close to the README file.

1192
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:23,200
So if the repository has a license file, which is recommended, then you can

1193
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:28,600
you can check what you are allowed to do with the repository.

1194
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,440
What changes can you do and how you can share them?

1195
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,880
So I'm going to click on the license file.

1196
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:43,240
And let's say that I actually don't know what this Creative Commons license actually means.

1197
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,160
So GitHub does

1198
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:50,240
provide a very nice summary if you open the license file.

1199
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:55,800
So this is a so the Creative Commons zero is a very permissive license.

1200
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,480
You can use it commercially.

1201
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:00,000
You can modify it and distribute it.

1202
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:04,000
And yes, basically, you can

1203
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,400
you can do

1204
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:08,840
you can do almost anything.

1205
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,880
It's not so suitable if you actually want to use this in a pattern.

1206
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,280
So depending on what is the ultimate

1207
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:20,880
goal of your project, then you may think of different licenses.

1208
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:24,400
And then again, in next the next week,

1209
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:30,120
we are going to have one lesson which discusses different licensing.

1210
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:34,680
So the very final thing to show before we

1211
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:40,680
go further is to browse issues and pull requests in the upstream repository.

1212
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:45,040
So remember, the upstream repository is the one that we have

1213
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:48,160
forked from, the one we have copied from.

1214
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:52,200
So let's say I don't remember what that link was.

1215
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:57,840
So if I go to my main page of the repository, then I can see that, OK,

1216
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,720
it has been forked from this repository.

1217
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:05,800
So I'm going to click on that and then I'm going to see.

1218
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,680
So the top menu shows the issues.

1219
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:13,000
There are two issues to this repository.

1220
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,000
And well, the recipe

1221
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:18,240
book repository, I'm sure, has many more issues.

1222
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:21,880
But this one in particular has two.

1223
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,640
And

1224
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:30,000
issues, you can see issues as like, let's say that you have some questions about

1225
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,760
this particular repository, maybe some features that you think that you would

1226
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:45,000
like to introduce, opening an issue is one way of starting a discussion on a project.

1227
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,200
Then there are some pull requests as well.

1228
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,680
And how to actually create these pull requests and why they are useful.

1229
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,240
We will be doing that in the first episode.

1230
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:04,000
So, [name], anything else that we should discuss before actually

1231
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:10,480
seeing how we can do commits now that we browse through the repository?

1232
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:14,200
There is a lot of good questions in the notes that

1233
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,960
we're monitoring.

1234
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:20,160
I don't see anything that

1235
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,160
maybe it's better to go to commit because

1236
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,480
some of the questions are starting to be about how you commit and messages and so

1237
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:31,600
on. So if we go to that, we can start answering them.

1238
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:34,320
Exactly. So

1239
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,480
committing changes.

1240
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:39,320
How do you actually commit changes?

1241
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:40,560
So

1242
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:43,360
we have started from this

1243
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,760
existing repository on GitHub.

1244
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,600
But let's assume that now we actually want to introduce our own changes.

1245
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:57,400
In this case, we want to add some new recipes or modify existing ones.

1246
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:05,200
So we can do that.

1247
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:14,040
So I'm going to scroll down a little bit as we have discussed that.

1248
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:21,640
So let's say that we have an existing repository with different commits.

1249
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:28,760
Let's say we have a series of commits on the main branch, so the main line of development.

1250
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:35,560
And then we want to create a new branch.

1251
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:40,360
So let's say that we have some features that we want to introduce and we do not

1252
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,760
want to do it on the main branch because maybe, well, we don't.

1253
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:50,000
We still want to ensure that this main branch produces results that we want.

1254
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:55,240
And we just want to introduce some experimentation to our project.

1255
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:59,120
So then we can create a new branch

1256
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:04,360
that we refer to in this case as your branch.

1257
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:09,760
And so our repository is going to

1258
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,360
look like this. So we have a series of commits that

1259
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:19,240
we add on this branch that we call your branch.

1260
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:23,240
But at any point in time, we can actually

1261
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:30,560
go back to the main branch and do further commits on this main branch.

1262
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:36,080
So then what we'll have is, so except the initial commits that we had,

1263
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:42,240
we have the new ones on your branch and then we have additional commits on main.

1264
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,600
So this is what the

1265
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:46,000
we'll want to

1266
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:51,400
do in in this repository recipe book.

1267
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:56,080
And again, there are different ways that one can do that.

1268
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:00,760
One can use GitHub and that's what we'll demonstrate.

1269
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:09,960
But one can also use the command line or work in an IDE as well.

1270
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:11,240
So it's up to you.

1271
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:13,720
But again, we'll show how you can do this.

1272
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,120
You can do it on GitHub.

1273
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,760
So

1274
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:23,120
we will continue with the same repository, the recipe book one.

1275
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,960
And

1276
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,640
and then

1277
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,040
what you need to make sure is that you work on your fork.

1278
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:34,840
So you work in your username recipe book.

1279
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:42,000
And then what you will do is to create a branch and add a recipe in that branch

1280
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,600
and then modify.

1281
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,320
That

1282
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:51,000
recipe in on that particular branch that you created.

1283
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:56,120
And further on, switch to the main branch and

1284
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:59,400
and add yet another commit.

1285
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,800
So

1286
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:10,160
[name], so let's say how long time should we say for this particular exercise?

1287
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:13,600
So we have 20 minutes

1288
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:17,040
until the scheduled lunch break.

1289
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,800
Should we

1290
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,280
say 20 minutes and then go to lunch and we don't say anything else?

1291
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:25,600
Or should we say

1292
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:30,960
we come back for a brief wrap up?

1293
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:35,320
So let's do a brief wrap up before the lunch.

1294
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,960
I think that's that would be good.

1295
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:43,120
Or we do the wrap up just after the lunch when we come back.

1296
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:44,800
That's also an option.

1297
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,520
Yeah, let's do a wrap up after lunch.

1298
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:51,520
People can go to lunch early and beat the cues and so on if they want.

1299
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,880
So, yeah. OK.

1300
01:57:53,080 --> 01:58:00,880
Yeah. So exercise lunch and then we are back in one hour and 20 minutes.

1301
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:08,920
Yes. OK.

1302
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:13,440
Oh, so I'm adding the info

1303
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:18,280
to the notes doc where the exercise is.

1304
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,160
We will keep

1305
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,840
answering questions as usual.

1306
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:28,760
Keep asking.

1307
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,440
Yeah.

1308
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,680
Any final stuff?

1309
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:38,080
So summary is.

1310
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:43,280
Now we're adding commits to something.

1311
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,680
And yeah.

1312
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:49,560
OK, so see you after lunch.

1313
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:50,760
You. Bye.

1314
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:13,480


1315
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:43,480


1316
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:13,480


1317
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:43,480


1318
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:13,480


1319
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:43,480


1320
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:13,480


1321
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:43,480


1322
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:13,480


1323
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:43,480


1324
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:13,480


1325
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:43,480


1326
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:13,480


1327
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:43,480


1328
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:13,480


1329
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:43,480


1330
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:13,480


1331
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:43,480


1332
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:13,480


1333
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:43,480


1334
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:13,480


1335
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:43,480


1336
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:13,480


1337
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:43,480


1338
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:13,480


1339
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:43,480


1340
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:13,480


1341
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:43,480


1342
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:13,480


1343
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:43,480


1344
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:13,480


1345
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:43,480


1346
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:13,480


1347
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:43,480


1348
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:13,480


1349
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:43,480


1350
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:13,480


1351
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:43,480


1352
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:13,480


1353
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:43,480


1354
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:13,480


1355
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:43,480


1356
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:13,480


1357
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:43,480


1358
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:13,480


1359
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:43,480


1360
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:13,480


1361
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:43,480


1362
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:13,480


1363
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:43,480


1364
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:13,480


1365
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:43,480


1366
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:13,480


1367
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:43,480


1368
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:13,480


1369
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:43,480


1370
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:13,480


1371
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:43,480


1372
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:13,480


1373
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:43,480


1374
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:13,480


1375
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:43,480


1376
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:13,480


1377
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:43,480


1378
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:13,480


1379
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:43,480


1380
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:13,480


1381
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:43,480


1382
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:13,480


1383
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:43,480


1384
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:13,480


1385
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:43,480


1386
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:13,480


1387
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:43,480


1388
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:13,480


1389
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:43,480


1390
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:13,480


1391
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:43,480


1392
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:13,480


1393
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:43,480


1394
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:13,480


1395
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:43,480


1396
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:13,480


1397
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:43,480


1398
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:13,480


1399
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:43,480


1400
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:13,480


1401
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:43,480


1402
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:13,480


1403
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:43,480


1404
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:13,480


1405
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:43,480


1406
02:45:13,440 --> 02:45:13,480


1407
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:43,480


1408
02:46:13,440 --> 02:46:13,480


1409
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:43,480


1410
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:13,480


1411
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:43,480


1412
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:13,480


1413
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:43,480


1414
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:13,480


1415
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:43,480


1416
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:13,480


1417
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:43,480


1418
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:13,480


1419
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:43,480


1420
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:13,480


1421
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:43,480


1422
02:53:13,440 --> 02:53:13,480


1423
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:43,480


1424
02:54:13,440 --> 02:54:13,480


1425
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:43,480


1426
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:13,480


1427
02:55:43,440 --> 02:55:43,480


1428
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:13,480


1429
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:43,480


1430
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:13,480


1431
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:43,480


1432
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:13,480


1433
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:43,480


1434
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:13,480


1435
02:59:43,440 --> 02:59:43,480


1436
03:00:13,440 --> 03:00:13,480


1437
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:43,480


1438
03:01:13,440 --> 03:01:13,480


1439
03:01:43,440 --> 03:01:43,480


1440
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:13,480


1441
03:02:43,440 --> 03:02:43,480


1442
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:13,480


1443
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:43,480


1444
03:04:13,440 --> 03:04:13,480


1445
03:04:43,440 --> 03:04:43,480


1446
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:13,480


1447
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:43,480


1448
03:06:13,440 --> 03:06:13,480


1449
03:06:43,440 --> 03:06:43,480


1450
03:07:13,440 --> 03:07:13,480


1451
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:43,480


1452
03:08:13,440 --> 03:08:13,480


1453
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:43,480


1454
03:09:13,440 --> 03:09:13,480


1455
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:43,480


1456
03:10:13,440 --> 03:10:13,480


1457
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:43,480


1458
03:11:13,440 --> 03:11:13,480


1459
03:11:43,440 --> 03:11:43,480


1460
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:13,480


1461
03:12:43,440 --> 03:12:43,480


1462
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:13,480


1463
03:13:43,440 --> 03:13:43,480


1464
03:14:13,440 --> 03:14:13,480


1465
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:43,480


1466
03:15:13,440 --> 03:15:13,480


1467
03:15:43,440 --> 03:15:43,480


1468
03:16:13,440 --> 03:16:13,480


1469
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:43,480


1470
03:17:13,440 --> 03:17:13,480


1471
03:17:43,440 --> 03:17:59,000
OK, welcome back, everyone.

1472
03:17:59,200 --> 03:18:01,480
I hope you had a good break.

1473
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:05,360
So just before

1474
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:08,000
this longer break,

1475
03:18:08,200 --> 03:18:11,360
we're supposed to do an exercise

1476
03:18:11,560 --> 03:18:12,880
on GitHub.

1477
03:18:12,920 --> 03:18:16,080
For this recipe book repository.

1478
03:18:16,280 --> 03:18:20,800
And I will quickly walk you through a solution.

1479
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,560
So I will.

1480
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:26,160
Go back to my fork.

1481
03:18:26,360 --> 03:18:32,560
And the first thing that we were to do is to make sure that

1482
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:37,120
you are that we are on the fork and that is correct.

1483
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:39,520
So I can see my username there.

1484
03:18:39,720 --> 03:18:42,720
So I'm not under the CR workshop.

1485
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,640
So I will show you how to find it.

1486
03:18:45,840 --> 03:18:48,160
So as you can see, the users.

1487
03:18:48,360 --> 03:18:50,840
Let me find my name and my user profiles.

1488
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:52,280
Let me see.

1489
03:18:52,520 --> 03:18:55,200
So let's see where from the rest of.

1490
03:18:55,400 --> 03:18:56,600
Open diggers.

1491
03:18:56,800 --> 03:19:00,320
We're going to have a detailed niec but it when we want to make sure

1492
03:19:00,960 --> 03:19:02,880
we don't go into all the different

1493
03:19:03,080 --> 03:19:05,160
나뉘지?

1494
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:08,080
We go to.

1495
03:19:08,280 --> 03:19:11,120
We can show OK that's it?

1496
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:15,920
which actually is the name of our default branch.

1497
03:19:16,500 --> 03:19:21,760
And I can switch to a new branch, sorry, to another branch,

1498
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:28,120
or I can actually create a new branch by just typing the name of it in the search one.

1499
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:31,420
So I will call, how should I call this new branch?

1500
03:19:31,500 --> 03:19:37,060
I will just call it new branch, which is a very bad name for a new branch.

1501
03:19:37,060 --> 03:19:44,960
But I will, I'll give you this bad name so that I can show you later how you can rename.

1502
03:19:45,200 --> 03:19:46,960
So that's what we have.

1503
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:48,860
I'm now on this new branch.

1504
03:19:50,620 --> 03:19:58,640
And then what I am to do next is to add a recipe.

1505
03:19:59,300 --> 03:20:02,820
So this seemed to be a common question in the notes.

1506
03:20:02,820 --> 03:20:07,040
So something about making the new branch and then committing.

1507
03:20:07,060 --> 03:20:10,580
On it and getting the commit to show up in the right place.

1508
03:20:10,980 --> 03:20:16,240
And I know this is also often a problem with doing it other ways.

1509
03:20:16,520 --> 03:20:25,880
So it's important that before you add changes, you do check on which branch you are.

1510
03:20:26,520 --> 03:20:32,060
So if you are working on GitHub, then you see this just under the repo info.

1511
03:20:32,680 --> 03:20:35,620
So in the code menu.

1512
03:20:35,620 --> 03:20:43,520
And then this is the branch of the, the name of the branch under this source control symbol that you may also recognize in other IDEs.

1513
03:20:43,940 --> 03:20:51,780
It's like having this, well, it's a symbol for, for actually merge the, merge the branches.

1514
03:20:52,840 --> 03:21:00,540
So, so yes, do make sure that this name corresponds to the branch where you actually want to introduce changes.

1515
03:21:00,620 --> 03:21:01,680
That's important.

1516
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:05,080
Just because you created the branch doesn't mean that you are on the wrong branch.

1517
03:21:05,080 --> 03:21:10,440
But on GitHub, the moment you do create the branch, it will switch to it directly.

1518
03:21:12,240 --> 03:21:13,860
And, and, oh, and now.

1519
03:21:13,980 --> 03:21:14,400
Oh, what happened?

1520
03:21:14,480 --> 03:21:15,680
It happens all the time.

1521
03:21:15,940 --> 03:21:21,880
When I, when I click, it just goes to, I don't know, goes bananas.

1522
03:21:22,420 --> 03:21:24,820
So now I'm on the main branch.

1523
03:21:24,940 --> 03:21:26,040
Actually, that's not what I want.

1524
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:32,660
So let me switch to this new branch.

1525
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:34,660
You see, I mean, sometimes GitHub behavior.

1526
03:21:35,080 --> 03:21:35,680
It's funny.

1527
03:21:36,400 --> 03:21:41,780
So it happened previously as well.

1528
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:47,240
That's why sometimes I don't like to work with the web interface because it just does what it wants.

1529
03:21:47,860 --> 03:21:51,700
So here I switch to the branch I actually want, new branch.

1530
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:55,820
And then I want to add some changes there.

1531
03:21:55,960 --> 03:21:58,260
So I will follow the instructions in the exercise.

1532
03:21:58,260 --> 03:22:04,480
So I was to, to, actually,

1533
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:05,060
I should have created a new branch.

1534
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:07,140
So sorry for that.

1535
03:22:07,280 --> 03:22:09,240
But the name is not super important.

1536
03:22:09,880 --> 03:22:15,320
So, but I should do, let's see, create a site recipe.

1537
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:22,200
And so, yes, I am now in these sub-directory sites.

1538
03:22:22,340 --> 03:22:23,360
I'm going to add a file.

1539
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:26,780
So I find it just under, under the menu, add file.

1540
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:28,740
And what can I see?

1541
03:22:28,740 --> 03:22:33,820
I can click the plus to create a new file, or I can actually upload a file.

1542
03:22:34,080 --> 03:22:34,940
If I have one.

1543
03:22:34,940 --> 03:22:44,660
I don't, I'm going to edit it on GitHub, which is okay for short files, but for longer ones,

1544
03:22:44,660 --> 03:22:51,420
I mean, of course it's more convenient to upload, but this, it really depends on what you want to do here.

1545
03:22:51,440 --> 03:22:52,880
I should also name my file.

1546
03:22:52,880 --> 03:23:01,580
So I'm going to use mixed nuts and I'm going to give it the same extension as all, as the other files in my repository have.

1547
03:23:01,680 --> 03:23:04,920
So when a Markdown file in short.

1548
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:09,800
It has an empty extension and then I'm going to enter a recipe.

1549
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:19,620
So let's see, I do have a template somewhere there, but let's call it, let's give it a title, mixed nuts.

1550
03:23:19,720 --> 03:23:20,780
And what should we have?

1551
03:23:21,440 --> 03:23:33,360
So I should have some ingredients and maybe some of you actually notice that unless I have this line, there, there are some GitHub actions, which will fail.

1552
03:23:33,660 --> 03:23:34,680
Then we'll see that later.

1553
03:23:34,680 --> 03:23:36,420
So, um, what went here?

1554
03:23:37,320 --> 03:23:38,580
What's your favorite nut?

1555
03:23:40,440 --> 03:23:45,720
Uh, cashews, pecan, walnuts.

1556
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:47,820
Yeah, walnuts.

1557
03:23:49,940 --> 03:23:52,560
And then let's add some instructions.

1558
03:23:55,840 --> 03:24:01,260
Let's say, um, I think it's adding extra, yeah, those bullet points there.

1559
03:24:01,260 --> 03:24:03,840
Um, let's see.

1560
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:16,240
Uh, yeah, nice and simple and typos is always.

1561
03:24:16,240 --> 03:24:20,100
So now I have my file here.

1562
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:26,000
So the next thing to do is to commit this, uh, change, then I click on this red.

1563
03:24:26,480 --> 03:24:28,620
Um, uh, bottom here.

1564
03:24:28,620 --> 03:24:29,540
So I, and.

1565
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:30,920
Uh, then here.

1566
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:32,900
And something is not working right now.

1567
03:24:32,920 --> 03:24:33,520
Let's go.

1568
03:24:33,520 --> 03:24:33,940
Let's go.

1569
03:24:33,940 --> 03:24:43,180
it is with a pop-up window asking for a commit message and uh and uh i get the default but i can

1570
03:24:43,180 --> 03:24:54,960
also write my own commit message so let's say add recipe for mixed nuts yeah okay so you're

1571
03:24:54,960 --> 03:25:02,020
and there was a question about what or how to write it and this is a common one it's like

1572
03:25:02,020 --> 03:25:14,700
imperative you are adding this yeah yeah so um this is a short uh change to our repository so

1573
03:25:14,700 --> 03:25:19,920
so it does not necessarily need an extended description but for example if you

1574
03:25:19,920 --> 03:25:25,100
do a lot of changes in your file then you might want to explain actually why you've

1575
03:25:25,100 --> 03:25:32,000
done those changes and what those changes are so one can add

1576
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:42,100
an extended description here. But it is important to have a commit message which will identify

1577
03:25:42,100 --> 03:25:47,560
in short the summary of your changes so that you can more easily find a certain commit

1578
03:25:47,560 --> 03:26:00,380
in your history of commits. So this also shows as a top line in the commit message when you

1579
03:26:00,380 --> 03:26:07,100
display the history of your repository. So it's important you have something concise

1580
03:26:07,100 --> 03:26:14,520
and suitable for these changes. And then I'm going to check that the branch that this should

1581
03:26:14,520 --> 03:26:21,180
be committed to is the one that I actually want. So the default is the one that we had

1582
03:26:21,180 --> 03:26:25,920
under code, but I can also create a new one. That is not the case. I do want to commit

1583
03:26:25,920 --> 03:26:29,380
under this one. And then I just click commit changes.

1584
03:26:29,380 --> 03:26:30,380
Yeah.

1585
03:26:30,380 --> 03:26:31,380
Okay.

1586
03:26:31,380 --> 03:26:41,380
So then I'm actually, I get this interesting message saying that my branch is ahead of

1587
03:26:41,380 --> 03:26:47,040
the upstream repository. So the one I copied from. This is a nice way to see, I mean, how

1588
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:59,040
does your repository stand with respect to the upstream? Do you? And yeah. So now we

1589
03:26:59,040 --> 03:27:00,320
are one commit ahead.

1590
03:27:00,320 --> 03:27:10,140
That means that I have one extra commit compared to these, to these repository. And as you

1591
03:27:10,140 --> 03:27:21,080
have forked from recipe book, you may actually get a different, a different message here.

1592
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:22,080
Okay, then.

1593
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:23,080
Yeah.

1594
03:27:23,080 --> 03:27:29,320
Now I should modify this recipe with a new commit on this, on the same.

1595
03:27:29,320 --> 03:27:39,320
On the same branch. So I will what I'm going to open this file again, and I'm going to

1596
03:27:39,320 --> 03:27:50,320
edit it. So I click on this edit. I don't want to add a new file. I just want to improve

1597
03:27:50,320 --> 03:27:58,880
it. So let's see. Seasoning. I'm going to say that we should have some seasoning, like,

1598
03:27:59,320 --> 03:28:00,320
salt or chili. What do you say?

1599
03:28:00,320 --> 03:28:01,320
Yeah, sure. I would like both of those.

1600
03:28:01,320 --> 03:28:21,320
Okay. So I like that. I'm going to commit this, and then I'm going to say ah, actually update

1601
03:28:21,320 --> 03:28:25,520
is not very useful.

1602
03:28:25,520 --> 03:28:27,320
I'm going to say add seasoning.

1603
03:28:27,320 --> 03:28:28,320
Oh.

1604
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:29,320
Ooh.

1605
03:28:29,320 --> 03:28:37,640
and then clear this one okay then so on the same branch commit changes so now what do i have i have

1606
03:28:37,640 --> 03:28:48,200
two new commits right on my new uh branch and then uh step four is to switch back to the main branch

1607
03:28:48,200 --> 03:28:56,120
and modify a recipe there as well so basically introduce a new commit there so i am going to

1608
03:28:56,120 --> 03:29:05,320
click on code go back to the main branch so select the main branch here it is and what should i do

1609
03:29:05,320 --> 03:29:19,080
here um let's open a recipe let's see what we have for salads here fruit salad i'm going to edit this

1610
03:29:19,080 --> 03:29:24,040
file um

1611
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:35,800
and let's say i actually don't want fresh means i'm going to take some whipped cream instead

1612
03:29:39,720 --> 03:29:45,160
and commit changes and then remove

1613
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:48,380
it

1614
03:29:55,240 --> 03:29:56,120
okay and then

1615
03:29:56,120 --> 03:30:02,280
again make sure i'm the on the right branch that i am so what do i have now

1616
03:30:04,200 --> 03:30:11,320
i have uh one new branch sorry one new commit on main actually it's not very easy to see

1617
03:30:11,320 --> 03:30:19,560
here but let's go to to this history view that we looked at before so i have this uh

1618
03:30:19,560 --> 03:30:24,160
this new commit remove mined at cream on the main one while on this new branch i had a memory and then I worked a lot with sepertiy can i take physical keys to this new

1619
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:26,080
not very easy to see here but let's go to to this history a view that uh we looked at before so i have this uh this new commit remove mean cream on the main one while on this new branch i have just in the first moment as one of the stop

1620
03:30:26,120 --> 03:30:27,840
I had added two commits.

1621
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:37,260
Actually, there was a branch which was called a new branch before,

1622
03:30:37,400 --> 03:30:38,660
but I have new commits.

1623
03:30:38,740 --> 03:30:42,340
I added two new commits here, add seasoning and add recipe for mixed nuts.

1624
03:30:42,820 --> 03:30:44,300
So what do I want to do now?

1625
03:30:45,440 --> 03:30:50,520
I want to actually compare the changes I have introduced

1626
03:30:50,520 --> 03:30:55,980
to the change on the main branch.

1627
03:30:56,120 --> 03:31:01,920
So in the repo, and I'm going to scroll down a bit here so you can see.

1628
03:31:02,740 --> 03:31:05,460
So I'm going to go to code.

1629
03:31:06,620 --> 03:31:14,280
So here, where I have the name of my main page of my repository,

1630
03:31:14,280 --> 03:31:21,260
I'm going to take that back and actually click and edit, sorry, write compare.

1631
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:25,660
So GitHub, my username, the name of the repository.

1632
03:31:26,720 --> 03:31:32,220
And then the important name compare.

1633
03:31:32,460 --> 03:31:36,640
So this, as you will see, works a little bit like the git div command.

1634
03:31:37,220 --> 03:31:44,560
So it will allow us to compare different commits that we have in our repository.

1635
03:31:44,560 --> 03:31:55,100
And I can choose either a branch or a commit from the left here.

1636
03:31:55,200 --> 03:31:56,020
So let's say.

1637
03:31:56,120 --> 03:31:59,020
That I want to compare.

1638
03:32:00,400 --> 03:32:01,880
Oh, how did you get here?

1639
03:32:02,060 --> 03:32:02,920
You got to.

1640
03:32:03,200 --> 03:32:04,860
So the way I did here.

1641
03:32:04,860 --> 03:32:17,700
So from the main page of the repository, I am in the wrong one.

1642
03:32:18,740 --> 03:32:19,180
It's the.

1643
03:32:19,400 --> 03:32:20,180
I should have.

1644
03:32:20,280 --> 03:32:24,520
It's because it swaps between the fork and upstream.

1645
03:32:25,160 --> 03:32:25,800
Okay.

1646
03:32:25,800 --> 03:32:27,200
A bit widely.

1647
03:32:27,860 --> 03:32:35,800
But so under my username and the name of the repository.

1648
03:32:36,620 --> 03:32:39,440
So recipe book reported and then compare.

1649
03:32:41,820 --> 03:32:44,240
So, yeah, this is what one should get.

1650
03:32:45,160 --> 03:32:49,780
And then I am prompted with what I would like to compare.

1651
03:32:50,340 --> 03:32:54,620
Either compare against the upstream.

1652
03:32:54,620 --> 03:32:55,620
So this.

1653
03:32:55,800 --> 03:32:59,520
Is your workshop exercises and I can choose which branch in particular.

1654
03:32:59,520 --> 03:33:03,060
I want to compare from there or yeah.

1655
03:33:03,060 --> 03:33:04,500
And what I want to compare with.

1656
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:14,460
So by default, it took my own repository, my own fork, and then, and then the branch name.

1657
03:33:15,120 --> 03:33:19,380
So actually I can see that compared to the upstream.

1658
03:33:19,820 --> 03:33:25,660
So the main branch has a change and that change is in.

1659
03:33:25,660 --> 03:33:34,000
This fruit salad file and the change is so in red is shown.

1660
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:45,840
What is missing in my main branch and in red shows what I have added to my, to my commit.

1661
03:33:45,840 --> 03:33:50,260
So I added this line and I removed the other one.

1662
03:33:50,280 --> 03:33:55,520
So this is what is different and I can also use it.

1663
03:33:56,100 --> 03:33:58,100
So that will show, and I can also cookies.

1664
03:33:58,100 --> 03:34:12,460
And, and then I want to compare header toं playing at

1665
03:34:12,820 --> 03:34:15,660
I have no youremp would say I want to compare a certain commits.

1666
03:34:15,660 --> 03:34:18,740
Then you want to do that.

1667
03:34:18,740 --> 03:34:22,920
I'm going to go to the history view again.

1668
03:34:22,920 --> 03:34:23,180
Okay.

1669
03:34:23,180 --> 03:34:24,320
So let's say I want to.

1670
03:34:24,400 --> 03:34:24,560
Yeah.

1671
03:34:24,600 --> 03:34:25,420
Two different commits.

1672
03:34:25,420 --> 03:34:29,340
the right thing here. And this is what I find a little bit annoying with

1673
03:34:31,580 --> 03:34:39,180
GitHub, because I can't see everything, first of all. Compare. Ah, this is so annoying.

1674
03:34:42,860 --> 03:34:48,140
So then actually you know what I'm going to do so that you all see what I am typing.

1675
03:34:50,060 --> 03:34:51,980
I'm just going to type it here.

1676
03:34:51,980 --> 03:35:01,260
Let's see. Bear with me for one second.

1677
03:35:01,260 --> 03:35:04,540
Okay. I see you opened notepad here.

1678
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:11,420
I'm going to open a text editor so that I can actually see what I am typing. So

1679
03:35:11,420 --> 03:35:19,100
compare. And then I'm going to copy this hash, for example. Let's see. And then you don't see

1680
03:35:19,100 --> 03:35:19,660
everything.

1681
03:35:19,660 --> 03:35:21,900
Mm-hmm. But I see

1682
03:35:21,980 --> 03:35:33,580
So now, so I add the full hash, and I'll add two dots, and then copy another hash. So let's see.

1683
03:35:35,260 --> 03:35:36,940
Actually, what is in my...

1684
03:35:41,580 --> 03:35:43,660
So this is upstream.

1685
03:35:43,660 --> 03:35:51,660
So this is the upstream. So the problem is that this always changes back automatically whenever

1686
03:35:52,380 --> 03:35:52,780
Mm-hmm.

1687
03:35:52,780 --> 03:35:54,700
Whenever I am...

1688
03:35:59,260 --> 03:36:04,380
Whenever GitHub doesn't find the link that you are trying to

1689
03:36:05,180 --> 03:36:11,740
edit, then it kind of figures out for you what you should be typing. So let's

1690
03:36:15,420 --> 03:36:18,460
edit the right thing. So this is very annoying.

1691
03:36:20,460 --> 03:36:21,900
And maybe you explain...

1692
03:36:21,980 --> 03:36:23,100
I'm going to change this as well.

1693
03:36:26,300 --> 03:36:32,300
So let's go back to the end and add the other hash.

1694
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:46,300
Okay. So let's go to the new branch and the latest commit on that.

1695
03:36:47,580 --> 03:36:49,420
Okay. I see your two commits.

1696
03:36:50,620 --> 03:36:51,820
Yes. And now I'm going to...

1697
03:36:51,980 --> 03:36:53,020
I'll copy paste this.

1698
03:36:56,220 --> 03:36:56,300
Okay.

1699
03:36:56,300 --> 03:36:57,900
This is not element, I should say.

1700
03:36:58,700 --> 03:36:59,180
Yeah.

1701
03:36:59,180 --> 03:37:04,220
I don't like this a lot, but it's a way to show that you can compare two commits on

1702
03:37:04,220 --> 03:37:04,940
GitHub, so...

1703
03:37:04,940 --> 03:37:11,820
Here we have it. We have a change between that commit specifies first and that was

1704
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:21,260
on the main branch. And then we have another hash, which stands for the latest commit on the

1705
03:37:21,260 --> 03:37:30,140
new branch. And what is different is this new file mixed nuts with this content. So again, it's,

1706
03:37:31,500 --> 03:37:36,460
yeah, it is a little bit troublesome to actually add all these hashes, so I don't find it ideal,

1707
03:37:38,140 --> 03:37:47,580
but it is one way of doing differences. And the final thing is renaming a branch. So let's see

1708
03:37:47,580 --> 03:37:59,580
how we can actually do that. So going back to the history of my commits, I see, oh actually I should

1709
03:37:59,580 --> 03:38:05,260
see all, view all branches. Let's do that. View all branches. So then I have a list of all the

1710
03:38:05,260 --> 03:38:16,540
branches for my repository. So let's assume that this new branch actually had a bad name. It's not,

1711
03:38:16,540 --> 03:38:17,500
actually it is very,

1712
03:38:17,580 --> 03:38:27,900
very bad because it's not representative for what it includes. And I have to scroll a little bit

1713
03:38:27,900 --> 03:38:35,900
here so that I get to the most right part with these three dots, which, if I click on that,

1714
03:38:35,900 --> 03:38:46,380
allows me to rename the branch. So I'm going to give it another name, `[name]/hummus` [the branch name includes our name]. It's not,

1715
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:47,420
it's quite common,

1716
03:38:47,420 --> 03:38:47,500
actually, to rename a branch. So I'm going to rename it `[name]/hummus`. It's not, it's quite common,

1717
03:38:47,500 --> 03:38:47,580
actually, to rename a branch. So I'm going to rename it `[name]/hummus`. It's not, it's quite common,

1718
03:38:47,580 --> 03:38:55,100
actually, that a branch, especially for a repository that has several collaborators,

1719
03:38:55,100 --> 03:39:03,500
that the branch contains the name of the person that initiated that branch. Especially if you are

1720
03:39:03,500 --> 03:39:17,420
the only person working on that particular branch. Okay. So that was it. I can also have tags and then,

1721
03:39:17,420 --> 03:39:27,260
again, go into code. So you'll see me going back to the main code a few many times. So I can add

1722
03:39:27,260 --> 03:39:36,060
tags, for example, there. And there are no tags right now. So what is a tag? Tag is like adding

1723
03:39:36,860 --> 03:39:45,260
another identifier to a certain commit. So let's see, I can

1724
03:39:45,260 --> 03:39:59,660
I can choose a new tag. Let's see, version 0.1. And then I have to specify which branch do I

1725
03:39:59,660 --> 03:40:15,100
actually want to tag. And then also the commit that I want to tag. So I'm going to take the

1726
03:40:15,100 --> 03:40:29,420
keyed node. It doesn't matter, so this one. And I will describe this as first draft of my recipe.

1727
03:40:34,220 --> 03:40:35,580
And then publish release.

1728
03:40:40,300 --> 03:40:45,020
Okay. So, but now what was it?

1729
03:40:45,020 --> 03:40:56,540
I have? So I have this new branch, `[name]/hummus`, which I may actually merge into the main branch,

1730
03:40:56,540 --> 03:41:06,220
if I wish. And then if I am on GitHub, I see that I am prompted with a compare and pull request tab.

1731
03:41:06,220 --> 03:41:23,820
So what happens if I click on that? So I can then incorporate the changes that I have in the Homos

1732
03:41:23,820 --> 03:41:34,620
branch into the main one. So I merge these two lines of work into one branch again. So what I

1733
03:41:35,180 --> 03:41:36,200
have to do is...

1734
03:41:36,220 --> 03:41:40,740
Is what we're doing part of the exercise right now, or is it going further?

1735
03:41:40,740 --> 03:41:42,440
No, it's not part of the exercise.

1736
03:41:42,780 --> 03:41:47,360
So we are now moving further into, so let me show you.

1737
03:41:48,320 --> 03:41:56,540
So we are moving now into merging changes and contributing to the project.

1738
03:41:57,040 --> 03:42:02,320
Okay, so is this a demo right now of this part?

1739
03:42:02,320 --> 03:42:06,460
Yeah, you can probably longer, you can better just watch

1740
03:42:06,460 --> 03:42:10,920
and then you can get to do this as an exercise.

1741
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:11,820
Okay.

1742
03:42:12,200 --> 03:42:20,740
So what you need to be careful, especially when you're doing this on GitHub,

1743
03:42:21,120 --> 03:42:29,100
is to specify which repository you want to have a pull request against.

1744
03:42:29,900 --> 03:42:32,200
So because GitHub knows that,

1745
03:42:32,320 --> 03:42:46,560
this repository is a fork of the upstream one CR workshop exercises recipe book,

1746
03:42:46,760 --> 03:42:54,360
then it's going to have a pull request against this repository by default.

1747
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:56,180
But I actually do not want that.

1748
03:42:56,180 --> 03:43:01,760
I want to do a pull request against my,

1749
03:43:02,320 --> 03:43:05,760
repository, the main branch on my repository.

1750
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:11,500
So now you'll see that by selecting that I got back to my main one.

1751
03:43:13,140 --> 03:43:23,000
And then the branch that I want to merge into this one is the Anahomous branch.

1752
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:25,000
So that that was correct.

1753
03:43:25,540 --> 03:43:32,120
And then it tells me, so GitHub tells me that it's able to merge this automatically.

1754
03:43:32,320 --> 03:43:45,980
automatically. I can add a title, so merging humus into main, for example, and I can give

1755
03:43:45,980 --> 03:43:53,320
it a description and create a pull request. There are different options. So if I click

1756
03:43:53,320 --> 03:43:58,860
on this triangle, I can see that I can choose the default, create pull request, but I can

1757
03:43:58,860 --> 03:44:07,060
also create a draft. This is if you still want to work on your branch before the final

1758
03:44:07,060 --> 03:44:14,100
merge. That is not what we want right now. We want to ask for a pull request. So this

1759
03:44:14,100 --> 03:44:23,300
is what I'm going to click on. So again, what this means is that I want to merge the humus

1760
03:44:23,300 --> 03:44:26,360
branch into the main one.

1761
03:44:26,360 --> 03:44:27,640
Okay.

1762
03:44:27,640 --> 03:44:28,640
So then

1763
03:44:28,640 --> 03:44:37,440
it tells me that, okay, everything is ready to be merged, but I actually have to confirm

1764
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:44,840
the merge. And because I am the only person that is actually working on this repository,

1765
03:44:44,840 --> 03:44:52,080
I get to do this merge myself. But when you are working on a shared repository with several

1766
03:44:52,080 --> 03:44:58,140
people, usually the person that does the pull request is not the one that is merging.

1767
03:44:58,140 --> 03:44:58,640
Okay.

1768
03:44:58,640 --> 03:45:07,440
So that is just, yeah, it's just a practice. But for repositories that you are working

1769
03:45:07,440 --> 03:45:16,460
on yourself, you can do the PR and the merging yourself. So then I click on this and then

1770
03:45:16,460 --> 03:45:27,760
I can provide a commit message. So I'm happy with that. And I click on commit merge.

1771
03:45:28,640 --> 03:45:37,100
So then let's check actually our network graph, see how that looks.

1772
03:45:37,180 --> 03:45:39,740
And then I'll listen to your comments.

1773
03:45:39,920 --> 03:45:40,500
One second.

1774
03:45:40,500 --> 03:45:43,500
So we're insights.

1775
03:45:44,180 --> 03:45:46,420
Sorry, I clicked on settings instead.

1776
03:45:46,720 --> 03:45:48,060
So insights network.

1777
03:45:50,260 --> 03:45:54,100
It takes a bit of time when there are many new commits.

1778
03:45:54,360 --> 03:45:58,000
It's going to show up quickly.

1779
03:45:58,640 --> 03:46:11,460
So what I have is this blue branch.

1780
03:46:12,240 --> 03:46:14,800
It was my `[name]/hummus` branch.

1781
03:46:15,540 --> 03:46:21,700
And then what I did in this last commit is to merge it into main.

1782
03:46:21,700 --> 03:46:24,580
So GitHub is going to show it like, okay,

1783
03:46:24,760 --> 03:46:28,620
there is an arrow from the `[name]/hummus`.

1784
03:46:28,640 --> 03:46:30,420
Branch into the main one.

1785
03:46:31,020 --> 03:46:36,240
It also prompts me with the commit message for that merge.

1786
03:46:36,900 --> 03:46:44,240
And now you may wonder why there are so many other things under the main one.

1787
03:46:44,300 --> 03:46:52,660
So these are simply different forks that exist for the upstream repository.

1788
03:46:53,320 --> 03:46:58,620
So GitHub is going to collect all that information and put it all in the

1789
03:46:58,640 --> 03:47:01,280
network graph.

1790
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:02,300
Yeah.

1791
03:47:03,060 --> 03:47:03,400
Okay.

1792
03:47:04,240 --> 03:47:04,680
Okay.

1793
03:47:05,600 --> 03:47:07,280
So where are we now?

1794
03:47:08,340 --> 03:47:09,780
So let's see.

1795
03:47:10,720 --> 03:47:17,820
So what we did was to show how a merge can be done on GitHub.

1796
03:47:18,720 --> 03:47:21,760
So then what you can do now.

1797
03:47:22,320 --> 03:47:27,380
So you also had your several commits on a branch and some,

1798
03:47:27,740 --> 03:47:28,620
possibly some new ones.

1799
03:47:28,620 --> 03:47:29,760
And you are commits on main.

1800
03:47:30,100 --> 03:47:34,100
So your task is now to attempt to merge these branches.

1801
03:47:36,160 --> 03:47:40,160
So merge your branch into the main one.

1802
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:46,860
So everything you just did with the pull request and the merge is now the

1803
03:47:46,860 --> 03:47:49,080
exercise where people do it themselves.

1804
03:47:49,080 --> 03:47:49,420
Yes.

1805
03:47:49,860 --> 03:47:50,760
Following the instructions.

1806
03:47:51,040 --> 03:47:51,160
Okay.

1807
03:47:51,640 --> 03:47:51,940
Yes.

1808
03:47:52,180 --> 03:47:55,280
And you can do it as I have done it using GitHub.

1809
03:47:55,680 --> 03:47:57,140
That's one solution.

1810
03:47:58,620 --> 03:48:05,200
And if you're comfortable with the command line and you've worked a little

1811
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:06,180
bit with Git before,

1812
03:48:06,360 --> 03:48:10,000
then you may attempt this solution as well.

1813
03:48:10,440 --> 03:48:15,060
But I recommend that you try GitHub.

1814
03:48:17,200 --> 03:48:18,580
There's a good question.

1815
03:48:18,900 --> 03:48:19,660
Number 61.

1816
03:48:19,980 --> 03:48:23,820
Can you make a pull request from the new branch to the main branch of the

1817
03:48:23,820 --> 03:48:24,860
original repository?

1818
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:26,980
Yes.

1819
03:48:26,980 --> 03:48:28,260
And I think that.

1820
03:48:28,620 --> 03:48:30,360
Go ahead.

1821
03:48:30,560 --> 03:48:31,540
Yes, you can.

1822
03:48:31,640 --> 03:48:32,660
Yes, you can do that.

1823
03:48:32,900 --> 03:48:35,220
And that is actually very common.

1824
03:48:35,560 --> 03:48:41,720
You usually do a pull request against the upstream.

1825
03:48:42,940 --> 03:48:46,820
And that is the whole reason why you actually do a fork.

1826
03:48:46,980 --> 03:48:51,020
For repositories, you do not have the right to modify.

1827
03:48:51,020 --> 03:48:54,920
You do some line work in your own fork.

1828
03:48:57,200 --> 03:48:57,840
And,

1829
03:48:57,940 --> 03:48:58,020
and then,

1830
03:48:58,620 --> 03:49:04,140
you may you may ask for a pull request and have your changes integrated in

1831
03:49:04,140 --> 03:49:06,220
the upstream repository.

1832
03:49:07,320 --> 03:49:07,880
So yes,

1833
03:49:07,880 --> 03:49:10,260
that is possible and very common.

1834
03:49:11,540 --> 03:49:12,040
Yeah.

1835
03:49:12,240 --> 03:49:21,060
And this is done as part of step seven of the it's an advanced step optional.

1836
03:49:21,720 --> 03:49:23,580
You can do it,

1837
03:49:23,860 --> 03:49:25,380
but also on day three,

1838
03:49:25,380 --> 03:49:27,120
we do this a lot.

1839
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:32,120
But I'd recommend starting with doing it in your own repository,

1840
03:49:32,120 --> 03:49:34,360
because then you can merge it today.

1841
03:49:34,360 --> 03:49:39,520
We're not going to be merging stuff into the public repository.

1842
03:49:40,860 --> 03:49:41,060
No,

1843
03:49:41,060 --> 03:49:43,160
we'll show that more on day three.

1844
03:49:44,000 --> 03:49:44,500
Yeah.

1845
03:49:45,280 --> 03:49:45,740
Okay.

1846
03:49:45,740 --> 03:49:46,500
So then,

1847
03:49:46,500 --> 03:49:47,120
uh,

1848
03:49:47,120 --> 03:49:48,580
exercise time until,

1849
03:49:48,580 --> 03:49:49,080
uh,

1850
03:49:50,940 --> 03:49:52,520
10 to set a good time.

1851
03:49:52,520 --> 03:49:56,240
[name] until for 20 minutes.

1852
03:49:56,240 --> 03:49:56,740
Okay.

1853
03:49:57,120 --> 03:50:01,620
Or how long did you say until yes,

1854
03:50:01,620 --> 03:50:02,560
20 minutes.

1855
03:50:03,160 --> 03:50:03,580
Okay.

1856
03:50:03,580 --> 03:50:04,940
So until,

1857
03:50:04,940 --> 03:50:05,240
yeah.

1858
03:50:08,340 --> 03:50:08,740
Okay.

1859
03:50:08,740 --> 03:50:09,240
Sounds good.

1860
03:50:09,540 --> 03:50:10,060
Um,

1861
03:50:10,060 --> 03:50:22,600
I'm setting it up and so the exercise is this here and our goal is to do everything except the optional step.

1862
03:50:24,660 --> 03:50:27,020
And after that we have more discussion.

1863
03:50:27,020 --> 03:50:28,400
And stuff while you wrap up,

1864
03:50:28,400 --> 03:50:28,900
I think.

1865
03:50:30,800 --> 03:50:31,600
Okay.

1866
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:31,940
Great.

1867
03:50:31,940 --> 03:50:33,500
See you in a little bit.

1868
03:50:35,240 --> 03:50:35,740
Bye.

1869
03:50:57,020 --> 03:51:27,020


1870
03:51:27,020 --> 03:51:57,020


1871
03:51:57,020 --> 03:52:27,020


1872
03:52:27,020 --> 03:52:57,020


1873
03:52:57,020 --> 03:53:27,020


1874
03:53:27,020 --> 03:53:57,020


1875
03:53:57,020 --> 03:54:27,020


1876
03:54:27,020 --> 03:54:57,020


1877
03:54:57,020 --> 03:55:27,020


1878
03:55:27,020 --> 03:55:57,020


1879
03:55:57,020 --> 03:56:27,020


1880
03:56:27,020 --> 03:56:57,020


1881
03:56:57,020 --> 03:57:27,020


1882
03:57:27,020 --> 03:57:57,020


1883
03:57:57,020 --> 03:58:27,020


1884
03:58:27,020 --> 03:58:57,020


1885
03:58:57,020 --> 03:59:27,020


1886
03:59:27,020 --> 03:59:57,020


1887
03:59:57,020 --> 04:00:27,020


1888
04:00:27,020 --> 04:00:57,020


1889
04:00:57,020 --> 04:01:27,020


1890
04:01:27,020 --> 04:01:57,020


1891
04:01:57,020 --> 04:02:27,020


1892
04:02:27,020 --> 04:02:57,020


1893
04:02:57,020 --> 04:03:27,020


1894
04:03:27,020 --> 04:03:57,020


1895
04:03:57,020 --> 04:04:27,020


1896
04:04:27,020 --> 04:04:57,020


1897
04:04:57,020 --> 04:05:27,020


1898
04:05:27,020 --> 04:05:57,020


1899
04:05:57,020 --> 04:06:27,020


1900
04:06:27,020 --> 04:06:57,020


1901
04:06:57,020 --> 04:07:27,020


1902
04:07:27,020 --> 04:07:57,020


1903
04:07:57,020 --> 04:08:27,020


1904
04:08:27,020 --> 04:08:57,020


1905
04:08:57,020 --> 04:09:27,020


1906
04:09:27,020 --> 04:09:57,020


1907
04:09:57,020 --> 04:10:27,020


1908
04:10:27,020 --> 04:10:57,020


1909
04:10:57,020 --> 04:11:27,020


1910
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:38,260
log

1911
04:11:43,600 --> 04:11:45,800
welcome back from the break.

1912
04:11:46,900 --> 04:11:48,900
What the exercise break.

1913
04:11:49,240 --> 04:11:49,560
Uh,

1914
04:11:49,560 --> 04:11:51,740
so,

1915
04:11:51,740 --> 04:11:52,400
I.

1916
04:11:52,400 --> 04:11:52,900
Uh,

1917
04:11:54,220 --> 04:11:56,600
I'm going to show these very final,

1918
04:11:56,600 --> 04:12:08,220
So every final step, which was optional, on how to actually handle pull requests to the upstream branch.

1919
04:12:09,460 --> 04:12:19,600
And so for that, I am going to go to CR Workshop Exercises Recipe Book and click on Pull Requests.

1920
04:12:19,600 --> 04:12:27,040
And please know that this is the recorded version, so I will not see all the pull requests that you have done.

1921
04:12:27,620 --> 04:12:30,320
But in this case, there are three pull requests.

1922
04:12:30,620 --> 04:12:36,040
So let's take this one from [name].

1923
04:12:37,080 --> 04:12:39,960
So what do I get to see here?

1924
04:12:39,960 --> 04:12:43,200
I get to see the committer.

1925
04:12:44,800 --> 04:12:48,260
And also, let's see.

1926
04:12:48,460 --> 04:12:49,560
What I want to see.

1927
04:12:49,920 --> 04:12:56,280
Is which files have been changed in this version that he has.

1928
04:12:57,400 --> 04:13:00,540
So there is a new recipe for burritos.

1929
04:13:01,300 --> 04:13:03,760
So this is the file that has been changed.

1930
04:13:04,000 --> 04:13:07,300
There are several commits in this branch.

1931
04:13:08,160 --> 04:13:12,440
And I assume, well, one of them has, well, two of them have failed.

1932
04:13:12,580 --> 04:13:18,080
So then he actually proposed a new commit that solved some of the errors that.

1933
04:13:18,700 --> 04:13:19,300
That.

1934
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:22,480
Were in, uh, in the project.

1935
04:13:23,560 --> 04:13:27,280
So, uh, I, let's see why I'm actually happy.

1936
04:13:27,460 --> 04:13:30,360
I am happy with this, uh, proposed the change.

1937
04:13:30,360 --> 04:13:36,520
So then what I can do is to merge the pull request that, uh, that, uh, [name] proposed.

1938
04:13:36,660 --> 04:13:39,420
So, um, I can also add the comments.

1939
04:13:39,420 --> 04:13:49,240
So it's, uh, especially nice to, uh, write the comments, especially if you don't, uh, need these

1940
04:13:49,240 --> 04:13:49,580
commits.

1941
04:13:49,600 --> 04:13:55,360
Um, and, uh, you only get to communicate with them via, via GitHub.

1942
04:13:55,620 --> 04:13:59,520
So thank you for your contribution.

1943
04:14:10,900 --> 04:14:17,940
And also I can, uh, comment, uh, to a pull request even before I merge and actually say,

1944
04:14:17,940 --> 04:14:19,580
okay, I would like you to change.

1945
04:14:19,600 --> 04:14:23,380
A certain file or, uh, or improve on a feature.

1946
04:14:23,660 --> 04:14:30,080
So I don't have to necessarily, uh, accept the merge in, uh, in its current state.

1947
04:14:30,160 --> 04:14:35,800
So maybe I want [name] to do some changes before that, but in this case I am happy.

1948
04:14:35,940 --> 04:14:43,320
So I'm going to merge it and I can, uh, write, uh, another commit message for the merge.

1949
04:14:43,620 --> 04:14:47,860
I'm going to take that and confirm the merge.

1950
04:14:47,860 --> 04:14:58,540
So then he's, uh, uh, recipe for the, uh, burritos is going to be in the main branch.

1951
04:14:58,540 --> 04:15:08,480
So if I go now to mains, then I can see that I have his recipe incorporated here.

1952
04:15:09,380 --> 04:15:10,460
I see.

1953
04:15:10,660 --> 04:15:10,980
Yeah.

1954
04:15:12,460 --> 04:15:16,380
So anything else that, uh, that we should add?

1955
04:15:16,920 --> 04:15:17,840
Let's see.

1956
04:15:17,860 --> 04:15:28,540
Uh, there's a question number 68, contributing to the original repository with pull request.

1957
04:15:29,540 --> 04:15:36,940
Um, you normally it's the other person.

1958
04:15:37,060 --> 04:15:41,100
So if you're contributing to someone else's repository, it's the other person that will

1959
04:15:41,100 --> 04:15:44,960
do the merge, but you don't need to have it in your main branch or anything.

1960
04:15:44,960 --> 04:15:47,840
It can be in your own branch.

1961
04:15:47,860 --> 04:15:59,540
Um, yeah, uh, there's Git switch versus Git checkout.

1962
04:15:59,880 --> 04:16:04,140
There's an older form of basically the same command.

1963
04:16:04,520 --> 04:16:09,100
So yeah, Git switch is the modern word for it.

1964
04:16:09,180 --> 04:16:11,100
That's been made a bit less confusing.

1965
04:16:13,040 --> 04:16:16,680
Um, should we go to our break now?

1966
04:16:16,680 --> 04:16:17,680
We can keep with the questions.

1967
04:16:17,860 --> 04:16:25,740
And then, um, we can do some final demos and discuss discussion afterwards.

1968
04:16:25,740 --> 04:16:26,740
Yeah.

1969
04:16:26,740 --> 04:16:27,740
Let's take a break.

1970
04:16:27,740 --> 04:16:28,740
And then we come back at 10 past.

1971
04:16:28,740 --> 04:16:29,740
Is that a good time?

1972
04:16:29,740 --> 04:16:30,740
Yeah.

1973
04:16:30,740 --> 04:16:31,740
Sounds good.

1974
04:16:31,740 --> 04:16:32,740
So back in 10 minutes.

1975
04:16:32,740 --> 04:16:33,740
So sounds good.

1976
04:16:33,740 --> 04:16:34,740
See you then.

1977
04:16:34,740 --> 04:16:35,740
Bye.

1978

Bye.

1991

Bye.

1992
04:16:49,860 --> 04:16:50,860
Bye.

1993
04:16:50,860 --> 04:16:51,860
Bye.

1994

Bye.

2003

Bye.

2004

Bye.

2005

Bye.

2006
04:17:14,020 --> 04:17:15,020
Bye.

2007
04:17:15,020 --> 04:17:16,020
Bye.

2008
04:17:16,020 --> 04:17:16,640
you

2009
04:17:46,020 --> 04:17:46,640
you

2010
04:18:16,020 --> 04:18:16,640
you

2011
04:18:46,020 --> 04:18:46,640
you

04:26:16,020 --> 04:26:16,640
you

2027
04:26:46,020 --> 04:26:46,640
you

2028
04:27:16,020 --> 04:27:16,640
you

2029
04:27:46,020 --> 04:27:46,640
you

2030
04:28:16,020 --> 04:28:41,580
okay welcome back from the break

2031
04:28:41,580 --> 04:28:43,880
so

2032
04:28:43,880 --> 04:28:45,940
before we show

2033
04:28:45,940 --> 04:28:46,980
a final demo

2034
04:28:46,980 --> 04:28:47,500
[name]

2035
04:28:47,500 --> 04:28:49,480
is there anything that we should

2036
04:28:49,480 --> 04:28:51,000
bring from the

2037
04:28:51,000 --> 04:28:52,120
collaborative doc

2038
04:28:52,120 --> 04:28:54,800
there was

2039
04:28:54,800 --> 04:28:56,180
a question about

2040
04:28:56,180 --> 04:28:57,420
restoring branches

2041
04:28:57,420 --> 04:28:59,400
and all

2042
04:28:59,400 --> 04:29:01,020
and

2043
04:29:01,020 --> 04:29:02,340
how long

2044
04:29:02,340 --> 04:29:02,900
like

2045
04:29:02,900 --> 04:29:04,460
how long can you restore things

2046
04:29:04,460 --> 04:29:06,100
I don't know how long

2047
04:29:06,100 --> 04:29:06,640
the

2048
04:29:06,640 --> 04:29:07,860
github button

2049
04:29:07,860 --> 04:29:09,160
for restoring branches

2050
04:29:09,160 --> 04:29:10,160
is still there

2051
04:29:10,160 --> 04:29:11,520
like if you make other changes

2052
04:29:11,520 --> 04:29:12,000
that

2053
04:29:12,000 --> 04:29:12,840
wouldn't work

2054
04:29:12,840 --> 04:29:14,360
but all the history

2055
04:29:14,360 --> 04:29:14,940
is

2056
04:29:14,940 --> 04:29:15,920
in the repository

2057
04:29:15,920 --> 04:29:18,520
and if you do a normal merge

2058
04:29:18,520 --> 04:29:20,000
you can always go

2059
04:29:20,000 --> 04:29:20,600
backwards

2060
04:29:20,600 --> 04:29:21,940
so maybe that's the more

2061
04:29:21,940 --> 04:29:22,940
important lesson there

2062
04:29:22,940 --> 04:29:24,000
once you have the history

2063
04:29:24,000 --> 04:29:24,660
even if

2064
04:29:24,660 --> 04:29:26,160
you don't have the button

2065
04:29:26,160 --> 04:29:26,820
you can

2066
04:29:26,820 --> 04:29:28,220
go backwards

2067
04:29:28,220 --> 04:29:31,020
yeah you can always see

2068
04:29:31,020 --> 04:29:31,340
the

2069
04:29:31,340 --> 04:29:31,980
closed

2070
04:29:31,980 --> 04:29:32,760
pull requests

2071
04:29:32,760 --> 04:29:34,340
and if you get to your

2072
04:29:34,340 --> 04:29:34,900
closed

2073
04:29:34,900 --> 04:29:35,640
pull requests

2074
04:29:35,640 --> 04:29:36,340
you can see that

2075
04:29:36,340 --> 04:29:36,980
okay you can

2076
04:29:36,980 --> 04:29:38,380
you may restore your

2077
04:29:38,380 --> 04:29:39,740
deleted branch

2078
04:29:39,740 --> 04:29:41,240
yeah

2079
04:29:41,240 --> 04:29:41,800
and

2080
04:29:41,800 --> 04:29:43,040
usually want to do that

2081
04:29:43,040 --> 04:29:44,420
if you want to add some

2082
04:29:44,420 --> 04:29:45,360
some

2083
04:29:45,360 --> 04:29:46,600
additional commits

2084
04:29:46,600 --> 04:29:47,340
to that branch

2085
04:29:47,340 --> 04:29:48,400
so yeah

2086
04:29:48,400 --> 04:29:49,940
and also the moment you do

2087
04:29:49,940 --> 04:29:50,380
a

2088
04:29:50,380 --> 04:29:52,020
new pull request

2089
04:29:52,020 --> 04:29:52,960
with the same name

2090
04:29:52,960 --> 04:29:54,360
then

2091
04:29:54,360 --> 04:29:55,940
that will be

2092
04:29:55,940 --> 04:29:57,420
restored by default

2093
04:29:57,420 --> 04:29:58,060
so

2094
04:29:58,060 --> 04:30:02,300
and there's some of these

2095
04:30:02,300 --> 04:30:03,160
other questions

2096
04:30:03,160 --> 04:30:04,040
about

2097
04:30:04,040 --> 04:30:04,640
pull

2098
04:30:04,640 --> 04:30:05,720
pull requests

2099
04:30:05,720 --> 04:30:06,420
versus

2100
04:30:06,420 --> 04:30:09,120
what's it

2101
04:30:09,120 --> 04:30:09,940
pull requests

2102
04:30:09,940 --> 04:30:10,600
versus

2103
04:30:10,600 --> 04:30:11,500
pushing

2104
04:30:11,500 --> 04:30:12,260
and so on

2105
04:30:12,260 --> 04:30:14,740
these are good questions

2106
04:30:14,740 --> 04:30:15,240
but maybe

2107
04:30:15,240 --> 04:30:16,320
we'll

2108
04:30:16,320 --> 04:30:17,500
go into them more

2109
04:30:17,500 --> 04:30:18,740
later when we do

2110
04:30:18,740 --> 04:30:19,340
some more

2111
04:30:19,340 --> 04:30:21,400
other demos

2112
04:30:21,400 --> 04:30:23,100
and so on

2113
04:30:23,100 --> 04:30:23,360
yeah

2114
04:30:23,360 --> 04:30:24,460
I think there's some

2115
04:30:24,460 --> 04:30:25,620
reasonable answers there

2116
04:30:25,620 --> 04:30:27,740
yeah it is a bit

2117
04:30:27,740 --> 04:30:28,480
confusing also

2118
04:30:28,480 --> 04:30:30,580
it's

2119
04:30:30,580 --> 04:30:34,700
what different

2120
04:30:34,700 --> 04:30:36,820
what all terminology

2121
04:30:36,820 --> 04:30:37,220
that

2122
04:30:37,220 --> 04:30:38,520
that github has

2123
04:30:38,520 --> 04:30:40,000
github developers

2124
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:40,760
have been using

2125
04:30:40,760 --> 04:30:41,500
and it's

2126
04:30:41,500 --> 04:30:42,860
a bit

2127
04:30:42,860 --> 04:30:44,260
tricky to understand

2128
04:30:44,260 --> 04:30:44,860
sometimes

2129
04:30:44,860 --> 04:30:45,220
but

2130
04:30:45,240 --> 04:30:46,520
if one should use

2131
04:30:46,520 --> 04:30:47,200
pull or pull

2132
04:30:47,200 --> 04:30:48,920
yeah

2133
04:30:48,920 --> 04:30:49,560
anyway

2134
04:30:49,560 --> 04:30:50,800
let's go to

2135
04:30:50,800 --> 04:30:51,640
actually

2136
04:30:51,640 --> 04:30:53,080
introducing a conflict

2137
04:30:53,080 --> 04:30:56,260
in our

2138
04:30:56,260 --> 04:30:57,720
merge

2139
04:30:57,720 --> 04:30:58,420
and

2140
04:30:58,420 --> 04:31:00,100
how do we get

2141
04:31:00,100 --> 04:31:00,840
to do that

2142
04:31:00,840 --> 04:31:02,260
so I'm going to go to

2143
04:31:02,260 --> 04:31:03,800
my own fork

2144
04:31:03,800 --> 04:31:05,580
and

2145
04:31:05,580 --> 04:31:06,320
so first off

2146
04:31:06,320 --> 04:31:08,160
what is a conflict

2147
04:31:08,160 --> 04:31:11,000
so

2148
04:31:11,000 --> 04:31:11,660
and

2149
04:31:11,660 --> 04:31:12,940
is this something

2150
04:31:12,940 --> 04:31:14,320
that we need to go into

2151
04:31:14,320 --> 04:31:15,040
now

2152
04:31:15,040 --> 04:31:17,240
like

2153
04:31:17,240 --> 04:31:17,920
where will

2154
04:31:17,920 --> 04:31:18,800
I mean

2155
04:31:18,800 --> 04:31:20,140
we want to go into it now

2156
04:31:20,140 --> 04:31:20,480
but

2157
04:31:20,480 --> 04:31:21,900
when does it become

2158
04:31:21,900 --> 04:31:22,580
important

2159
04:31:22,580 --> 04:31:24,820
so

2160
04:31:24,820 --> 04:31:26,180
a conflict

2161
04:31:26,180 --> 04:31:26,980
appears

2162
04:31:26,980 --> 04:31:27,860
when

2163
04:31:27,860 --> 04:31:29,120
you are changing

2164
04:31:29,120 --> 04:31:30,720
the same

2165
04:31:30,720 --> 04:31:31,940
portion

2166
04:31:31,940 --> 04:31:32,900
of the file

2167
04:31:32,900 --> 04:31:35,040
in two different branches

2168
04:31:35,040 --> 04:31:37,280
and then you want to merge

2169
04:31:37,280 --> 04:31:38,400
those two branches

2170
04:31:38,400 --> 04:31:39,960
and then

2171
04:31:39,960 --> 04:31:42,180
either you merge it

2172
04:31:42,180 --> 04:31:43,240
via the command line

2173
04:31:43,240 --> 04:31:43,720
or

2174
04:31:43,720 --> 04:31:44,720
or on github

2175
04:31:45,040 --> 04:31:46,540
it doesn't know

2176
04:31:46,540 --> 04:31:47,320
git doesn't know

2177
04:31:47,320 --> 04:31:47,580
okay

2178
04:31:47,580 --> 04:31:48,880
how do you actually

2179
04:31:48,880 --> 04:31:49,900
which changes

2180
04:31:49,900 --> 04:31:50,860
do you want to keep

2181
04:31:50,860 --> 04:31:51,860
from these two branches

2182
04:31:51,860 --> 04:31:52,880
because I'm having

2183
04:31:52,880 --> 04:31:53,780
contradicting

2184
04:31:53,780 --> 04:31:54,820
modifications

2185
04:31:54,820 --> 04:31:55,900
to the same

2186
04:31:55,900 --> 04:31:56,860
part of the file

2187
04:31:56,860 --> 04:31:58,160
and I have no idea

2188
04:31:58,160 --> 04:31:59,200
how to resolve those

2189
04:31:59,200 --> 04:32:00,820
so that's

2190
04:32:00,820 --> 04:32:02,160
that's what we mean

2191
04:32:02,160 --> 04:32:02,860
like a conflict

2192
04:32:02,860 --> 04:32:04,400
I am unsure

2193
04:32:04,400 --> 04:32:06,180
git is unsure

2194
04:32:06,180 --> 04:32:08,200
about how to merge

2195
04:32:08,200 --> 04:32:09,300
these different changes

2196
04:32:09,300 --> 04:32:09,980
because

2197
04:32:09,980 --> 04:32:12,980
they appear

2198
04:32:12,980 --> 04:32:14,840
in the same

2199
04:32:15,040 --> 04:32:15,540
file

2200
04:32:15,540 --> 04:32:16,600
in the same portion

2201
04:32:16,600 --> 04:32:17,600
of the file

2202
04:32:17,600 --> 04:32:18,280
into

2203
04:32:18,280 --> 04:32:19,180
different commits

2204
04:32:19,180 --> 04:32:20,160
that we want to merge

2205
04:32:20,160 --> 04:32:20,680
different

2206
04:32:20,680 --> 04:32:21,580
two different branches

2207
04:32:21,580 --> 04:32:22,820
we want to merge

2208
04:32:22,820 --> 04:32:24,280
so

2209
04:32:24,280 --> 04:32:25,300
I think it's going to be

2210
04:32:25,300 --> 04:32:25,820
clearer

2211
04:32:25,820 --> 04:32:26,580
if I

2212
04:32:26,580 --> 04:32:28,140
demo it

2213
04:32:28,140 --> 04:32:28,620
so again

2214
04:32:28,620 --> 04:32:29,680
I'm going to

2215
04:32:29,680 --> 04:32:30,260
do that

2216
04:32:30,260 --> 04:32:31,420
on github

2217
04:32:31,420 --> 04:32:32,000
so

2218
04:32:32,000 --> 04:32:34,420
I will create a new branch

2219
04:32:34,420 --> 04:32:38,080
let's call it

2220
04:32:38,080 --> 04:32:39,220
oh

2221
04:32:39,220 --> 04:32:39,980
what should I call it

2222
04:32:39,980 --> 04:32:41,800
creatures

2223
04:32:41,800 --> 04:32:44,380
hmm

2224
04:32:44,380 --> 04:32:45,040
good question

2225
04:32:45,040 --> 04:32:45,360
well

2226
04:32:45,360 --> 04:32:46,620
I'm going to make it

2227
04:32:46,620 --> 04:32:48,480
I'm going to call it soup

2228
04:32:48,480 --> 04:32:51,400
because my plan

2229
04:32:51,400 --> 04:32:52,360
is to

2230
04:32:52,360 --> 04:32:54,160
take some

2231
04:32:54,160 --> 04:32:56,420
are you modifying

2232
04:32:56,420 --> 04:32:57,040
your recipe

2233
04:32:57,040 --> 04:32:57,560
here

2234
04:32:57,560 --> 04:32:57,980
yeah

2235
04:32:57,980 --> 04:32:58,880
I'm going to take

2236
04:32:58,880 --> 04:33:00,220
an existing recipe

2237
04:33:00,220 --> 04:33:02,960
this mushroom soup recipe

2238
04:33:02,960 --> 04:33:04,540
and I am going to

2239
04:33:04,540 --> 04:33:06,740
to modify it

2240
04:33:06,740 --> 04:33:08,580
and then commit

2241
04:33:08,580 --> 04:33:10,000
these modifications

2242
04:33:10,000 --> 04:33:11,580
so I am

2243
04:33:11,580 --> 04:33:12,680
yes I am in

2244
04:33:12,680 --> 04:33:13,720
in the branch

2245
04:33:13,720 --> 04:33:14,260
soup

2246
04:33:14,260 --> 04:33:14,360
and I am going to

2247
04:33:14,380 --> 04:33:15,380
save this

2248
04:33:15,380 --> 04:33:16,380
into a new commit

2249
04:33:16,380 --> 04:33:17,380
and then I'll

2250
04:33:17,380 --> 04:33:18,380
assume

2251
04:33:18,380 --> 04:33:19,380
let's assume

2252
04:33:19,380 --> 04:33:20,380
that

2253
04:33:20,380 --> 04:33:21,380
yeah

2254
04:33:21,380 --> 04:33:22,380
let's see

2255
04:33:22,380 --> 04:33:23,380
that

2256
04:33:23,380 --> 04:33:24,380
um

2257
04:33:24,380 --> 04:33:25,380
what did I want to change

2258
04:33:25,380 --> 04:33:26,380
here

2259
04:33:26,380 --> 04:33:27,380
that I want to have

2260
04:33:27,380 --> 04:33:28,380
two cups

2261
04:33:28,380 --> 04:33:29,380
of

2262
04:33:29,380 --> 04:33:30,380
cream

2263
04:33:30,380 --> 04:33:31,380
okay

2264
04:33:31,380 --> 04:33:32,380
yeah

2265
04:33:32,380 --> 04:33:33,380
and then

2266
04:33:33,380 --> 04:33:34,380
I'm going to

2267
04:33:34,380 --> 04:33:35,380
save this

2268
04:33:35,380 --> 04:33:36,380
changes

2269
04:33:36,380 --> 04:33:37,380
into a new commit

2270
04:33:37,380 --> 04:33:38,380
so

2271
04:33:38,380 --> 04:33:39,380
more

2272
04:33:39,380 --> 04:33:40,380
cups

2273
04:33:40,380 --> 04:33:41,380
of cream

2274
04:33:41,380 --> 04:33:42,380
and then

2275
04:33:42,380 --> 04:33:43,380
I'm going to

2276
04:33:43,380 --> 04:33:44,260
save this

2277
04:33:44,260 --> 04:33:45,260
and then commit

2278
04:33:45,260 --> 04:33:46,260
this to

2279
04:33:46,260 --> 04:33:47,260
[name] soup

2280
04:33:47,260 --> 04:33:48,260
okay

2281
04:33:48,260 --> 04:33:49,260
and then

2282
04:33:49,260 --> 04:33:50,260
what I will do

2283
04:33:50,260 --> 04:33:51,260
is I'm going to

2284
04:33:51,260 --> 04:33:52,260
go to the

2285
04:33:52,260 --> 04:33:53,260
main branch

2286
04:33:53,260 --> 04:33:55,260
now

2287
04:33:55,260 --> 04:33:56,260
and

2288
04:33:56,260 --> 04:33:58,260
change exactly

2289
04:33:58,260 --> 04:33:59,260
the same file

2290
04:33:59,260 --> 04:34:00,260
where was the

2291
04:34:00,260 --> 04:34:01,260
main branch

2292
04:34:01,260 --> 04:34:02,260
here

2293
04:34:02,260 --> 04:34:03,260
I'm going to

2294
04:34:03,260 --> 04:34:04,260
change the same file

2295
04:34:04,260 --> 04:34:05,260
again

2296
04:34:05,260 --> 04:34:06,260
actually the same

2297
04:34:06,260 --> 04:34:07,260
portion of the

2298
04:34:07,260 --> 04:34:08,260
file

2299
04:34:08,260 --> 04:34:09,260
but I'm going to

2300
04:34:09,260 --> 04:34:10,260
introduce a different

2301
04:34:10,260 --> 04:34:11,260
change

2302
04:34:11,260 --> 04:34:12,260
so

2303
04:34:12,260 --> 04:34:13,260
soup

2304
04:34:13,260 --> 04:34:15,260
mushroom soup

2305
04:34:15,260 --> 04:34:16,260
edit

2306
04:34:16,260 --> 04:34:17,260
and then

2307
04:34:17,260 --> 04:34:18,260
I'll say that

2308
04:34:18,260 --> 04:34:19,260
okay

2309
04:34:19,260 --> 04:34:20,260
I actually

2310
04:34:20,260 --> 04:34:21,260
only want

2311
04:34:21,260 --> 04:34:22,260
half a cup

2312
04:34:22,260 --> 04:34:23,260
of heavy cream

2313
04:34:23,260 --> 04:34:24,260
and then

2314
04:34:24,260 --> 04:34:25,260
commit this

2315
04:34:25,260 --> 04:34:26,260
change

2316
04:34:26,260 --> 04:34:27,260
again

2317
04:34:27,260 --> 04:34:28,260
well now I am

2318
04:34:28,260 --> 04:34:29,260
on the main

2319
04:34:29,260 --> 04:34:30,260
branch

2320
04:34:30,260 --> 04:34:31,260
to commit this

2321
04:34:31,260 --> 04:34:32,260
so

2322
04:34:32,260 --> 04:34:33,260
um

2323
04:34:33,260 --> 04:34:34,260
I'll call it

2324
04:34:34,260 --> 04:34:35,260
less cream

2325
04:34:35,260 --> 04:34:36,260
this commit

2326
04:34:36,260 --> 04:34:37,260
message

2327
04:34:37,260 --> 04:34:38,260
and

2328
04:34:38,260 --> 04:34:39,260
commit

2329
04:34:39,260 --> 04:34:40,260
so

2330
04:34:40,260 --> 04:34:41,260
what do I have

2331
04:34:41,260 --> 04:34:42,260
now

2332
04:34:42,260 --> 04:34:43,260
I have two different

2333
04:34:43,260 --> 04:34:44,260
modifications

2334
04:34:44,260 --> 04:34:45,260
to this soup

2335
04:34:45,260 --> 04:34:46,260
recipe

2336
04:34:46,260 --> 04:34:47,260
in two different

2337
04:34:47,260 --> 04:34:48,260
branches

2338
04:34:48,260 --> 04:34:49,260
and it's

2339
04:34:49,260 --> 04:34:50,260
the same line

2340
04:34:50,260 --> 04:34:51,260
which is modified

2341
04:34:51,260 --> 04:34:52,260
in different ways

2342
04:34:52,260 --> 04:34:53,260
so now

2343
04:34:53,260 --> 04:34:54,260
let's go

2344
04:34:54,260 --> 04:34:55,260
to

2345
04:34:57,260 --> 04:34:58,260
let's try

2346
04:34:58,260 --> 04:34:59,260
to merge

2347
04:34:59,260 --> 04:35:00,260
this

2348
04:35:04,260 --> 04:35:05,260
so I have

2349
04:35:05,260 --> 04:35:06,260
this

2350
04:35:06,260 --> 04:35:07,260
branch

2351
04:35:07,260 --> 04:35:08,260
[name] soup

2352
04:35:08,260 --> 04:35:09,260
that I

2353
04:35:09,260 --> 04:35:10,260
want to

2354
04:35:10,260 --> 04:35:11,260
merge

2355
04:35:11,260 --> 04:35:12,260
into the main

2356
04:35:12,260 --> 04:35:13,260
branch

2357
04:35:13,260 --> 04:35:14,260
so I click

2358
04:35:14,260 --> 04:35:15,260
compare and pull

2359
04:35:15,260 --> 04:35:16,260
request

2360
04:35:16,260 --> 04:35:17,260
and again

2361
04:35:17,260 --> 04:35:18,260
I should be

2362
04:35:18,260 --> 04:35:19,260
careful

2363
04:35:19,260 --> 04:35:20,260
what I

2364
04:35:20,260 --> 04:35:21,260
want to

2365
04:35:21,260 --> 04:35:22,260
merge

2366
04:35:22,260 --> 04:35:23,260
so I don't

2367
04:35:23,260 --> 04:35:24,260
want to

2368
04:35:24,260 --> 04:35:25,260
merge

2369
04:35:25,260 --> 04:35:26,260
against the

2370
04:35:26,260 --> 04:35:27,260
upstream

2371
04:35:27,260 --> 04:35:28,260
I actually

2372
04:35:28,260 --> 04:35:29,260
want to

2373
04:35:29,260 --> 04:35:30,260
choose

2374
04:35:30,260 --> 04:35:31,260
my

2375
04:35:31,260 --> 04:35:32,260
repository

2376
04:35:32,260 --> 04:35:33,260
and

2377
04:35:33,260 --> 04:35:34,260
I

2378
04:35:34,260 --> 04:35:35,260
uh

2379
04:35:35,260 --> 04:35:36,260
want to

2380
04:35:36,260 --> 04:35:37,260
merge

2381
04:35:37,260 --> 04:35:38,260
the branch

2382
04:35:38,260 --> 04:35:39,260
called

2383
04:35:39,260 --> 04:35:40,260
the

2384
04:35:40,260 --> 04:35:41,260
soup

2385
04:35:41,260 --> 04:35:42,260
so I

2386
04:35:42,260 --> 04:35:43,260
can't

2387
04:35:43,260 --> 04:35:44,260
it's

2388
04:35:44,260 --> 04:35:45,260
it's

2389
04:35:45,260 --> 04:35:46,260
not

2390
04:35:46,260 --> 04:35:47,260
not

2391
04:35:47,260 --> 04:35:48,260
in

2392
04:35:48,260 --> 04:35:49,260
my

2393
04:35:49,260 --> 04:35:50,260
web

2394
04:35:50,260 --> 04:35:51,260
so I

2395
04:35:51,260 --> 04:35:52,260
have

2396
04:35:52,260 --> 04:35:53,260
to

2397
04:35:53,260 --> 04:35:54,260
merge

2398
04:35:54,260 --> 04:35:55,260
this

2399
04:35:55,260 --> 04:35:56,260
is

2400
04:35:56,260 --> 04:35:57,260
a

2401
04:35:57,260 --> 04:35:58,260
common

2402
04:35:58,260 --> 04:35:59,260
thing

2403
04:35:59,260 --> 04:36:00,260
to

2404
04:36:00,260 --> 04:36:01,260
happen

2405
04:36:01,260 --> 04:36:02,260
if

2406
04:36:02,260 --> 04:36:03,260
it's

2407
04:36:03,260 --> 04:36:04,260
a

2408
04:36:04,260 --> 04:36:05,260
project

2409
04:36:05,260 --> 04:36:06,260
with

2410
04:36:06,260 --> 04:36:07,260
multiple

2411
04:36:07,260 --> 04:36:08,260
people

2412
04:36:08,260 --> 04:36:09,260
hopefully

2413
04:36:09,260 --> 04:36:10,260
you're

2414
04:36:10,260 --> 04:36:18,760
And I could still create a pull request or a merge request, but then it told me that,

2415
04:36:18,760 --> 04:36:22,740
okay, you have to resolve the conflicts before this can be merged.

2416
04:36:22,740 --> 04:36:31,960
So then what I do is to click on this resolve conflicts and I, so GitHub is going to open

2417
04:36:31,960 --> 04:36:38,740
this file, mushroom soup, which has the conflict.

2418
04:36:38,740 --> 04:36:46,440
And it's going to introduce these delimiters to indicate where the conflict is.

2419
04:36:46,440 --> 04:36:51,540
Usually when one resolves the conflict, actually one should remove these delimiters.

2420
04:36:51,540 --> 04:36:53,440
So I will remove them.

2421
04:36:53,440 --> 04:36:58,020
And it's the same if one does it on the command line, these delimiters will show up, but then

2422
04:36:58,020 --> 04:37:03,480
I have to decide which of these lines or well, how do I want this line to look like?

2423
04:37:03,480 --> 04:37:05,020
So what do you think?

2424
04:37:05,020 --> 04:37:07,860
I'm actually going to go for half a cup.

2425
04:37:07,860 --> 04:37:08,720
Okay.

2426
04:37:08,720 --> 04:37:15,480
So this is you as a human deciding which one is the more useful one right now.

2427
04:37:15,480 --> 04:37:16,480
Exactly.

2428
04:37:16,480 --> 04:37:17,480
Exactly.

2429
04:37:17,480 --> 04:37:18,480
Yes.

2430
04:37:18,480 --> 04:37:27,340
So I am going to scroll down and then mark, yes, it was actually up here.

2431
04:37:27,340 --> 04:37:32,400
So mark as resolved and then click on commit the merge.

2432
04:37:32,400 --> 04:37:38,020
So mark as resolved, it means that actually I have accepted this change, but I still have

2433
04:37:38,020 --> 04:37:38,420
to instruct.

2434
04:37:38,420 --> 04:37:42,660
GitHub that I want to merge these two branches.

2435
04:37:42,660 --> 04:37:51,180
So merge the, the Anna soup branch into the main one and I can add more comments.

2436
04:37:51,180 --> 04:37:52,180
Okay.

2437
04:37:52,180 --> 04:37:58,180
I don't want to add more comments and then just confirm this merge.

2438
04:37:58,180 --> 04:37:59,180
Yeah.

2439
04:37:59,180 --> 04:38:04,900
So yeah, that's one way a conflict can, can emerge.

2440
04:38:04,900 --> 04:38:06,180
And of course it's undesirable.

2441
04:38:06,180 --> 04:38:07,180
Yeah.

2442
04:38:07,180 --> 04:38:08,180
Yeah.

2443
04:38:08,180 --> 04:38:13,940
If there are two different people that have introduced changes and you don't know how

2444
04:38:13,940 --> 04:38:21,180
to resolve them, then some then might actually need to sit together or have some email communication

2445
04:38:21,180 --> 04:38:26,940
or GitHub communication to see how it's best to resolve that conflict.

2446
04:38:26,940 --> 04:38:29,060
Yeah.

2447
04:38:29,060 --> 04:38:34,840
So this is actually pretty useful because normally if two people were modifying the

2448
04:38:34,840 --> 04:38:35,840
same thing.

2449
04:38:35,840 --> 04:38:36,840
Yeah.

2450
04:38:36,840 --> 04:38:40,840
You would have to be human to open them both and figure out what's what and do a lot of

2451
04:38:40,840 --> 04:38:42,460
manual work here.

2452
04:38:42,460 --> 04:38:50,260
You still had to do manual work, but it showed you exactly what the problem was and was much

2453
04:38:50,260 --> 04:38:57,140
easier than some of the manual merges in my past when I've sent someone code and had to

2454
04:38:57,140 --> 04:38:58,140
get it back.

2455
04:38:58,140 --> 04:38:59,140
Yeah.

2456
04:38:59,140 --> 04:39:00,140
Cool.

2457
04:39:00,140 --> 04:39:06,720
I think this also makes us realize that if you have a branch you've been working on,

2458
04:39:06,720 --> 04:39:12,480
working on a long time and you're waiting for too long before you actually try to merge

2459
04:39:12,480 --> 04:39:19,040
it into the main one, it's more likely that you are going to encounter conflicts when

2460
04:39:19,040 --> 04:39:20,180
you try to merge.

2461
04:39:20,180 --> 04:39:27,420
So it's, it's good to, to think, well, it's good not to wait too long before, before attempting

2462
04:39:27,420 --> 04:39:35,340
a merge because otherwise it's gonna, well, it's going to take many days to resolve some

2463
04:39:35,340 --> 04:39:36,340
of the conflicts.

2464
04:39:36,340 --> 04:39:37,340
Yeah.

2465
04:39:37,340 --> 04:39:43,500
So it's, of course, very dependent from repository to repository, but yeah, it's something to

2466
04:39:43,500 --> 04:39:44,500
keep in mind.

2467
04:39:44,500 --> 04:39:48,880
If it's one person, then, well, you get to re to decide how these conflicts should be

2468
04:39:48,880 --> 04:39:49,880
resolved.

2469
04:39:49,880 --> 04:39:54,060
But, but the more people involved, the more opinions.

2470
04:39:54,060 --> 04:39:55,060
So

2471
04:39:55,060 --> 04:39:56,060
Yeah.

2472
04:39:56,060 --> 04:39:57,060
Yeah.

2473
04:39:57,060 --> 04:39:58,060
Okay.

2474
04:39:58,060 --> 04:40:06,100
So what now should we go to the notes and for a final discussion?

2475
04:40:06,100 --> 04:40:09,100
Looking at different questions and so on.

2476
04:40:09,100 --> 04:40:10,100
Yeah.

2477
04:40:10,100 --> 04:40:17,980
Maybe just the final thing is like, so we showed most of the things on GitHub while

2478
04:40:17,980 --> 04:40:24,380
we did say that, okay, you can do all these using either the command line or using VS

2479
04:40:24,380 --> 04:40:30,100
code or another, another ID, but what is your preference, [name]?

2480
04:40:30,100 --> 04:40:33,100
When should we use what?

2481
04:40:33,100 --> 04:40:35,100
So.

2482
04:40:35,100 --> 04:40:47,480
I definitely do use GitHub sometimes, especially for small updates and things like that.

2483
04:40:47,480 --> 04:40:54,040
And for reviewing and merging things that are relatively clear, I don't often go making

2484
04:40:54,040 --> 04:40:57,860
new files and doing like serious changes.

2485
04:40:57,860 --> 04:41:02,600
So like adding a recipe, like we've done, yeah, I might as well copy and paste there

2486
04:41:02,600 --> 04:41:04,100
if I don't have it locally.

2487
04:41:04,100 --> 04:41:12,180
But for all the real work, it's always done via my local copy of the repository, which

2488
04:41:12,180 --> 04:41:16,100
is what we will get to tomorrow.

2489
04:41:16,100 --> 04:41:24,960
But still being able to merge both of them together is very useful because one is easier

2490
04:41:24,960 --> 04:41:25,960
short term.

2491
04:41:25,960 --> 04:41:26,960
One is easier long-term.

2492
04:41:26,960 --> 04:41:27,960
Yeah.

2493
04:41:27,960 --> 04:41:28,960
It's the same for me.

2494
04:41:28,960 --> 04:41:30,100
If I have one change for commit, it's the same for me.

2495
04:41:30,100 --> 04:41:31,100
Yeah.

2496
04:41:31,100 --> 04:41:32,100
Yeah.

2497
04:41:32,100 --> 04:41:33,100
Yeah.

2498
04:41:33,100 --> 04:41:34,100
Yeah.

2499
04:41:34,100 --> 04:41:35,100
Yeah.

2500
04:41:35,100 --> 04:41:36,100
Then yeah, I'll do that on GitHub.

2501
04:41:36,100 --> 04:41:42,820
And also if I'm working on a different computer and I don't have a clone of that repository,

2502
04:41:42,820 --> 04:41:50,960
so a copy of that repository on my local machine, then I'll just work on GitHub instead.

2503
04:41:50,960 --> 04:41:57,100
But the moment I have many changes to different files, then I think that using the command

2504
04:41:57,100 --> 04:41:58,700
line is better.

2505
04:41:58,700 --> 04:42:03,100
But then there is also a threshold until you get comfortable enough and you know enough

2506
04:42:03,100 --> 04:42:08,660
commands to actually get to do these things on the command line.

2507
04:42:08,660 --> 04:42:16,860
Although I think that, yeah, it's, you can do a lot with just 10 Git commands.

2508
04:42:16,860 --> 04:42:22,500
So there are definitely pros and cons to these different ways.

2509
04:42:22,500 --> 04:42:27,400
And I think that GitHub and the features that actually GitHub has have evolved a lot in

2510
04:42:27,400 --> 04:42:28,400
the last years.

2511
04:42:28,400 --> 04:42:31,100
There are many things that you can do using the GUI interface.

2512
04:42:31,100 --> 04:42:32,100
Yeah.

2513
04:42:32,100 --> 04:42:38,320
And I think that maybe the interface compared or the web interface compared to how it was

2514
04:42:38,320 --> 04:42:39,320
five years back.

2515
04:42:39,320 --> 04:42:41,540
So, and I think it's still going to evolve.

2516
04:42:41,540 --> 04:42:47,580
So at some point maybe you don't need to do things in the command line unless you, unless

2517
04:42:47,580 --> 04:42:48,880
you prefer that.

2518
04:42:48,880 --> 04:42:49,880
Yeah.

2519
04:42:49,880 --> 04:42:50,880
But, okay.

2520
04:42:50,880 --> 04:42:51,880
Let's see.

2521
04:42:51,880 --> 04:43:00,660
Did I already say at the bottom there's a feedback section, so we'll keep answering

2522
04:43:00,660 --> 04:43:01,660
questions.

2523
04:43:01,660 --> 04:43:10,580
You can tell us if today was too fast, too slow, a good speed and so on, and then something

2524
04:43:10,580 --> 04:43:17,040
to improve, something good about today, any other feedback and what you can keep asking

2525
04:43:17,040 --> 04:43:18,040
questions.

2526
04:43:18,040 --> 04:43:30,380
In the meantime, I want to talk about this question number 74 for a conflict to arise

2527
04:43:30,380 --> 04:43:31,380
there.

2528
04:43:31,660 --> 04:43:32,660
Sorry.

2529
04:43:32,660 --> 04:43:37,540
I'm making sure my cat isn't eating some cables or something.

2530
04:43:37,540 --> 04:43:38,540
Yeah.

2531
04:43:38,540 --> 04:43:39,540
So.

2532
04:43:39,540 --> 04:43:42,800
The conflict to arise.

2533
04:43:42,800 --> 04:43:46,340
So if it's the same line, it's a definite conflict.

2534
04:43:46,340 --> 04:43:52,060
Does anyone know, is it the case if there's something that's on several adjacent lines,

2535
04:43:52,060 --> 04:43:53,060
if it detects a conflict?

2536
04:43:53,060 --> 04:43:59,040
I think there has to be at least a line in between so that it's not interpreted as a

2537
04:43:59,040 --> 04:44:00,040
conflict.

2538
04:44:00,040 --> 04:44:01,040
Okay.

2539
04:44:01,040 --> 04:44:02,040
Yeah.

2540
04:44:02,040 --> 04:44:03,040
Makes sense.

2541
04:44:03,040 --> 04:44:04,040
Because.

2542
04:44:04,040 --> 04:44:05,040
Yeah.

2543
04:44:05,040 --> 04:44:11,400
So basically it tries to be safer rather than risk messing thing up.

2544
04:44:11,400 --> 04:44:15,980
But of course you can change code so that Git doesn't detect a conflict, but the final

2545
04:44:15,980 --> 04:44:19,900
code doesn't work together with the two different changes.

2546
04:44:19,900 --> 04:44:24,920
And for that, the way to detect it is with automatic software tests, which GitHub and

2547
04:44:24,920 --> 04:44:27,280
Git can run automatically.

2548
04:44:27,280 --> 04:44:29,920
But that's something we cover on day six.

2549
04:44:29,920 --> 04:44:34,920
And that's really sort of the capstone part of it.

2550
04:44:34,920 --> 04:44:36,420
Yeah.

2551
04:44:36,420 --> 04:44:41,920
So we haven't really showed how to compare commits.

2552
04:44:41,920 --> 04:44:48,020
Well, we did show how to compare commits on GitHub a bit, but I would say actually before

2553
04:44:48,020 --> 04:44:52,780
every single merge, you should check what you are trying to merge.

2554
04:44:52,780 --> 04:44:57,920
What are the changes that I introduced on this branch and the branch app and what are

2555
04:44:57,920 --> 04:44:58,920
the changes in the...

2556
04:44:58,920 --> 04:45:02,860
And what is different on the branch I'm trying to merge into.

2557
04:45:02,860 --> 04:45:06,400
That is, I would say a must before attempting any merge.

2558
04:45:06,400 --> 04:45:08,020
In this case, it was a simple example.

2559
04:45:08,020 --> 04:45:15,940
I knew exactly what is different on those two branches, but usually, well, you do want

2560
04:45:15,940 --> 04:45:16,940
to check.

2561
04:45:16,940 --> 04:45:19,440
I mean, what have people been modifying on the main branch?

2562
04:45:19,440 --> 04:45:23,020
I know the changes I made, or I can recheck the changes I made.

2563
04:45:23,020 --> 04:45:27,920
And then once I compare that either on GitHub or using Git diff.

2564
04:45:27,920 --> 04:45:28,920
Yeah.

2565
04:45:28,920 --> 04:45:37,320
And I know, okay, this is what I expect from the merge and maybe you may even actually

2566
04:45:37,320 --> 04:45:41,320
anticipate some of the conflicts before you are attempting the merge.

2567
04:45:41,320 --> 04:45:47,860
So definitely test how the commits are different between merging.

2568
04:45:47,860 --> 04:45:49,020
Yeah.

2569
04:45:49,020 --> 04:45:51,860
This is a common pattern we'll see in future days.

2570
04:45:51,860 --> 04:45:57,860
So it's really easy to, in VS Code, command line, or even GitHub, you get to a place like

2571
04:45:57,860 --> 04:45:58,880
you're on a branch.

2572
04:45:58,880 --> 04:46:04,480
You're expecting, and you start doing something and things get messed up somehow underneath.

2573
04:46:04,480 --> 04:46:11,260
So we'll really emphasize before you do anything, you stop, understand where you are, and then

2574
04:46:11,260 --> 04:46:14,640
you do the next part.

2575
04:46:14,640 --> 04:46:17,580
Yeah.

2576
04:46:17,580 --> 04:46:27,060
So before we take any other questions, should our participants prepare for anything in particular

2577
04:46:27,060 --> 04:46:28,160
before tomorrow?

2578
04:46:28,160 --> 04:46:28,780
Yeah.

2579
04:46:28,780 --> 04:46:29,280
Yes.

2580
04:46:29,280 --> 04:46:32,300
Actually, there's this news here that's related to this question.

2581
04:46:32,300 --> 04:46:35,840
Do we recommend VS Code or shell-based?

2582
04:46:35,840 --> 04:46:41,600
So for the news, so we have the recordings available.

2583
04:46:41,600 --> 04:46:44,240
Twitch will have them immediately.

2584
04:46:44,240 --> 04:46:50,080
And probably I will have them on YouTube by midnight finish time.

2585
04:46:50,080 --> 04:46:53,480
Let's see how well it actually goes.

2586
04:46:53,480 --> 04:46:58,060
So since tomorrow is more local work, so not from the GitHub web interface, today you didn't

2587
04:46:58,060 --> 04:47:00,860
need anything installed on your computer.

2588
04:47:00,860 --> 04:47:05,100
But tomorrow, you need something installed.

2589
04:47:05,100 --> 04:47:06,680
So we have two main tracks.

2590
04:47:06,680 --> 04:47:12,360
One is with the command line, and one is with Visual Studio Code.

2591
04:47:12,360 --> 04:47:15,580
And you can choose either of them.

2592
04:47:15,580 --> 04:47:21,400
I'm not sure which one we will demonstrate with, but it does require stuff to be installed

2593
04:47:21,400 --> 04:47:22,400
and set up.

2594
04:47:22,400 --> 04:47:25,680
So definitely look at the installation instructions.

2595
04:47:25,680 --> 04:47:26,680
And either way.

2596
04:47:26,680 --> 04:47:29,740
And then the one thing that I'm going to add, is that the shell crash course will be useful,

2597
04:47:29,740 --> 04:47:31,860
because it will prepare for today.

2598
04:47:31,860 --> 04:47:37,060
No matter what you do, you're going to need to type some things in a command line.

2599
04:47:37,060 --> 04:47:41,180
And it's better to have a little bit of familiarity with it first.

2600
04:47:41,180 --> 04:47:42,180
Yeah.

2601
04:47:42,180 --> 04:47:49,800
So if you're not used to the command line, then feel free to watch the shell course.

2602
04:47:49,800 --> 04:47:50,800
Yeah.

2603
04:47:50,800 --> 04:47:53,760
And in day three, there will be even more setup.

2604
04:47:53,760 --> 04:47:56,520
You'll need to join a team and request access to a report.

2605
04:47:56,520 --> 04:47:56,560
Yeah.

2606
04:47:56,560 --> 04:47:56,660
Yeah.

2607
04:47:56,680 --> 04:48:03,140
And then there will be the repository before you can do a certain part.

2608
04:48:03,140 --> 04:48:05,280
And as for what we recommend...

2609
04:48:05,280 --> 04:48:06,280
Yeah.

2610
04:48:06,280 --> 04:48:07,280
Yeah, sorry.

2611
04:48:07,280 --> 04:48:09,640
We will email you about the steps that you need to do before day three.

2612
04:48:09,640 --> 04:48:10,640
Yeah.

2613
04:48:10,640 --> 04:48:12,640
So no worries.

2614
04:48:12,640 --> 04:48:14,500
Yeah.

2615
04:48:14,500 --> 04:48:23,560
And as for do we recommend the shell or VS Code?

2616
04:48:23,560 --> 04:48:26,560
Really, I'd probably recommend whatever you're already familiar with.

2617
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:32,080
already using if you're using VS code a lot use that because that's what you're more likely to

2618
04:48:32,080 --> 04:48:40,060
use later if you don't know well you can try it both tracks of the exercises do it in VS code

2619
04:48:40,060 --> 04:48:45,460
and then do it in command line or vice versa and then you see how they relate and will learn even

2620
04:48:45,460 --> 04:48:52,540
more because even though I use both of them sometimes well I use the shell more and it's

2621
04:48:52,540 --> 04:48:59,320
important to be able to put them together yeah and also if you have another ID that

2622
04:48:59,320 --> 04:49:06,100
you prefer that's also okay to use although we will not be demonstrating that but you can

2623
04:49:06,100 --> 04:49:13,480
still get help from from all the other persons behind the scenes which are helping us answer

2624
04:49:13,480 --> 04:49:21,880
all these questions yeah um is there anything else

2625
04:49:22,540 --> 04:49:31,780
um I guess the preparations for the next day is the most important part yeah I know I heard rumors

2626
04:49:31,780 --> 04:49:40,600
of there being a install help session via Zoom an hour before we start tomorrow I'm not sure if

2627
04:49:40,600 --> 04:49:50,080
that's happening but I guess you will get an email about it if it does yes and also many of the news

2628
04:49:50,080 --> 04:49:52,480
and important information is also

2629
04:49:52,540 --> 04:50:01,480
on the course website or will be on the course website uh shortly so uh we want to or actually

2630
04:50:01,480 --> 04:50:08,800
maybe I can show where to find all these of course I don't have the page open

2631
04:50:11,380 --> 04:50:18,820
so yeah just go to code Refinery and see a thing

2632
04:50:22,540 --> 04:50:34,180
what they say 25 25 Workshop yes

2633
04:50:36,340 --> 04:50:43,720
so news are going to be here and also you may find the past communication under this tab

2634
04:50:43,720 --> 04:50:51,880
communication so then all the communication all the previous emails are going to be there but most

2635
04:50:51,880 --> 04:50:52,520
important things

2636
04:50:52,540 --> 04:50:54,440
will be under the news

2637
04:50:54,440 --> 04:50:54,840
here

2638
04:50:54,840 --> 04:50:57,600
good to know

2639
04:50:57,600 --> 04:51:02,660
I think that's about

2640
04:51:02,660 --> 04:51:04,080
it for today and

2641
04:51:04,080 --> 04:51:06,180
hopefully you found this useful

2642
04:51:06,180 --> 04:51:07,760
and you'll join us tomorrow

2643
04:51:07,760 --> 04:51:10,060
and we'll continue with

2644
04:51:10,060 --> 04:51:10,800
it

2645
04:51:10,800 --> 04:51:13,300
yes

2646
04:51:13,300 --> 04:51:15,620
so

2647
04:51:15,620 --> 04:51:18,780
good so see you tomorrow

2648
