3.1 Icebreaker and intro - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

Introduction of day 3.  Most people will go straight to the other videos. This segment does however contain some useful discussion about the goals of the course and how you should approach learning scientific computing, given how overwhelming this course can seem.

-----

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
