3.6 MPI overview - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

MPI (message-passing interface) is the standard way for jobs to communicate across processes or nodes on a massive scale.  Here, we talk very briefly about how to run MPI jobs on a cluster.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
