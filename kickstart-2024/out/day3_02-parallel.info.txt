3.2 Different methods of parallel computing - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

Before we get to how to run parallel jobs, let's talk about the different forms, since a person must keep these straight in order to run them the right way on the cluster.  The forms are listed below.

05:06 Embarassingly parallel / perfectly parallel
08:34 Shared memory parallelism
11:54 MPI parallelism
15:35 GPU parallelization
21:00 How well does your code parallelize
25:53 Wrap-up

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
