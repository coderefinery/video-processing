1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Hello.

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,320
Can anyone hear us?

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,560
Yeah, I think they can hear us, at least.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,120
I can hear us on the stream.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
You hear us?

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Okay, good.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,560
That's a good start.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:55,960
Let's get all these controls going.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Yeah, we have icebreakers, like, unless you like icy weather in the chat.

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,560
What is your favorite weather?

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,060
Yeah.

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,440
OK, so yeah, so [name], what's your favorite weather?

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,840
I would say that it's like, it's a weather that changes

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
every two weeks or something.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
Like, I don't usually like it to be

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,360
the same too long at a time.

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,280
But I do like Finnish winters.

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,320
It's great.

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,280
Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,040
I mean, a cold, dry winter is good.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah, dry, yeah.

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,160
Yeah.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,360
And you know, like once it gets to 20, it can get too hot sometimes, but maybe

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:10,600
15 to 20 and sunny, occasional rain every few days to keep the fire warnings away.

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It's often said that, especially in the cold weather, it's a question of what are you wearing.

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,600
But I think for different kinds of weather, it's the question of what are you planning on doing.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Summer weather is very nice if you're planning on going to the beach or something like that.

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,600
But it's not very nice if you're inside and have to work.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:46,600
If you say you happen to be inside with a bunch of computers running a streaming setup in a insulated building.

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Yeah. Not necessarily the best weather for that sort of an activity. I don't know who would do that.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay. The next question is which technologies have you used?

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
And there are some things there like Python, multi-processing, R parallel and so on.

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:18,100
These are all basically ways to use multiple processors at once, and maybe other people can add more of them there.

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:26,600
If you don't know the terminology, it's okay, you'll learn later, but if you do know it and you've used it, then mark it down.

36
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,600
And this is really important, because this is basically going to be... well, this is what we'll go through here.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:42,040
Yeah, and don't worry about the word salad again like this, there's going to be a lot

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,200
of these terms and we'll try to explain them when we go, like when we encounter them.

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,720
But yeah, there's going to be some of these words that especially like we already encountered

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,520
yesterday the bash batch kind of a thing where you basically have to have a keen ear to differentiate

41
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,520
the different technologies, like which is a Bash shell and which is a Bash script,

42
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:16,200
especially depending on pronunciation, they can sound pretty much the same. We have some

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,040
similar kind of stuff happening today with MPI and MP. Don't get worried about it. If

44
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,080
something is unclear, just ask in the notes and we'll try to clarify the thoughts.

45
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,480
Okay, and the last question, which task,

46
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,440
not computing related,

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,600
has involved the most number of synchronized people

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,560
working on the same things?

49
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
So it could be, for example,

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,640
like what's the typical thing?

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,680
These Olympic opening ceremonies or something

52
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
where the countries try to get the most number of dancers

53
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,740
just to put on a show,

54
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,240
or it could be a sporting event,

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,400
or what else involves a lot of synchronized people?

56
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,160
There have been these shows, I think in Italy at least,

57
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
where people are playing, like hundreds of people

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,600
are playing like instruments together,

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,560
like guitars or drums and rocking together,

60
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,520
like a thousand people playing electric guitar

61
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,440
at the same time.

62
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,760
I think this summer there's going to be like a bass

63
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,560
playing this kind of like show in Helsinki center that will involve like hundreds of

64
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,560
bassists playing together with the same song so. Yeah there's an interesting comment there

65
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:52,120
street fighting with the police I hope that was well I hope that's a joke and not actual protest

66
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,840
in some country where that happens.

67
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,680
Or maybe it's like a football activity or something like that.

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,920
Ah, yeah. Is football hooliganism considered synchronized though?

69
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
That's a good question, yeah.

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:24,200
But anyway, yeah, protests are probably the most synchronized things I would imagine.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:31,520
I mean, I guess there's different kinds of synchronized, for example, a protest is people

72
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:41,680
are working towards the same thing, but there's usually not a central leadership managing

73
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,560
every little operation. Maybe getting people in one place, but it's separate. While some

74
00:06:48,560 --> 00:07:04,600
things like these Olympic Opening Ceremony would be... what's it called? Olympic Opening

75
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Ceremony. This is very strongly synchronized probably with a single leader that is guiding

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,320
everyone like an orchestra so there's clearly one leader and everyone sees

77
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:23,560
this person and is following their cues. Oh army is a good one yeah some big

78
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,240
military exercises involve huge numbers of people and all kinds of complex

79
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:39,500
logistics. Okay now the hard part try to make a metaphor of these tasks to the

80
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,420
different parallel programming styles.

81
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,220
I didn't think that far ahead.

82
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:57,620
Like, I think, yeah, like, all of these are, like, some of them

83
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,460
are more in sync than others.

84
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,020
For example, like dancing, I would say is probably the most

85
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
in sync out of these.

86
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,780
And some of them are like just individuals doing stuff, but at

87
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,380
same time. So some of these, like we're going to be talking

88
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,220
about different methods of parallelization in the cluster

89
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,740
environment. And some of these are more synchronous, and some

90
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,220
of them aren't. And in many cases, probably throughout your

91
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,620
your work where you will encounter situations where

92
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,540
you're basically like middle manager for computer programs.

93
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,660
So instead of like, like, you need to manage all of these

94
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:44,300
different workers that try to do stuff for you. So basically you have your own small

95
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,340
virtual office of workers and you try to like keep them in check and then there's always one

96
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,860
of these programs that doesn't work correctly or something. You need to waste a lot of time

97
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,940
trying to get it working. So we'll talk about many of these things throughout the day.

98
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:23,020
I wish I could think of this metaphor to what we're going to talk about, but it's okay.

99
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:30,980
Technoparty, yeah, there you've got some music playing which everyone's going for, or like

100
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,620
dancing to it at the same time.

101
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Yeah.

102
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,580
Well, should we begin?

103
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Yeah, sure.

104
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,220
So are you going to play it to my screen or?

105
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,940
Sure.

106
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:55,060
Do you give a start of, do you start off with the day's intro?

107
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,260
It's going to your screen now.

108
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,700
You can do it.

109
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,540
OK.

110
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,020
Maybe I'll, I'm coming to my screen then.

111
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,060
OK.

112
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,540
Hey, it worked.

113
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,780
OK.

114
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,540
So yeah, we are beginning day three.

115
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,700
And as you see from the schedule,

116
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,260
it's all about Parallel.

117
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,780
We start with a big picture here.

118
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,660
And then we go to the different forms of Parallelism.

119
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,660
We have a brief intermission where

120
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:34,880
The CSC comes and gives a talk about their services.

121
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,320
And then we talk about GPUs.

122
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:50,160
And as usual, there's an Ask Us Anything session where we expect lots of good questions.

123
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,360
So the hardest part about today isn't so much the commands we learn, which are similar,

124
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
knowing what to use and how they fit with the programs.

125
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,120
So one thing I've often seen there's some program it says it runs parallel

126
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,760
but it's not clear about how it runs parallel and thus isn't clear how to

127
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
run a parallel on our cluster. And that's the most important thing

128
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,480
we can say and what we'll focus on. And of course as every day

129
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,000
there's a lot of different...

130
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,360
well we give a summary but you need to read yourself.

131
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,800
So with that said, I guess we go to what does parallel mean? And I push it to [name]'s screen.

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,000
There we go. So, hello. [name], parallel computing, what does it mean?
