1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Hello, welcome back.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:14,560
So now with us, we have a visitor from CSC, [name].

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,640
I hope I got that correct.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,400
Yeah, pretty, pretty good.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,760
But [name] works at CSC, the IT Center for Science.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:33,060
So CSC is the national high-performance computing center in Finland, but not just that.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,260
It's actually a whole lot more than just the services you see here.

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,700
And even what you see here isn't just high-performance computing.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,420
But anyway, CSC is paid by the Ministry of Culture and Education, I believe, to provide

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:58,220
services for free to academic researchers and others within Finland. So CSC, like all the

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:06,300
things we've been talking about today, CSC has similar but larger, a bigger scale. It might be

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,620
a little bit more work to use because you have to apply for the resources and migrate to there.

13
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,620
but if you need power or cross-university collaboration,

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,380
this is the place to go.

15
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,740
And was that a good intro?

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,580
Should you?

17
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,860
That was an excellent intro.

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,900
Okay, yeah.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,460
So I will stay here.

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,900
I'll be looking for questions in the notes

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,180
and raise them at an appropriate time.

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,700
So go ahead.

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,340
Okay, thanks [name] for introduction.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:51,020
So, I will tell, I mean, you already heard in brief what CSC is, I might tell a little bit more

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,500
and then I give a bit more details at what kind of computing services CSC provides and for what

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:08,700
kind of use cases you might want to use our computing services. Science for a long time,

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,020
even I mean if you're using computers hasn't been only about computing so data

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:22,540
is also a big aspect aspect and we have also some services more more related to

29
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,020
data I'll discuss them briefly and finally some something else like

30
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,820
training we provide and of course if you want or need to use CSC services what

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:43,580
you actually need to do for that. As said, we are owned by the Ministry of Education,

32
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,580
which owns about 80% of the shares and the rest 20% is actually owned by the Finnish

33
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:58,860
universities. We are a non-profit company and we provide a lot of different services

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,380
for the science and higher education.

35
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,180
I didn't actually check now

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,500
what's the latest number of staff we have,

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,180
but I think it's starting to be close to 700

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,860
or something like that.

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,860
And out from the 700, maybe 120 or 130

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,940
work actually with the scientific computing

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,520
and supercomputing.

42
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,060
And even though we are sort of discussing here

43
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:34,100
that CSC Computing Services and what you need to do in order to get to be used.

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,180
I actually can assure you that all of you already at this point,

45
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,380
you are CSC users. If you have ever used any network

46
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,220
within the university, the backbone that's provided by

47
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,780
FUNET, pretty much always when you log into your any university web

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,620
services, so you're using account authentication. If you're using Wi-Fi, you're most likely using

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,740
Eduroam. So these are sort of these other services and I think many of the

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,540
standard administration systems, probably if you look for your course results and things like that,

51
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:25,380
there is very probably some CSC mode also there. And coming back to the computing services,

52
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:37,780
And things I'm talking here, as I already said, what's probably of big interest for many of you is that you don't actually need to pay most of this any money.

53
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,780
So that's already paid by the Ministry of Education.

54
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Okay, in what kind of situation you might need CSC services?

55
00:04:51,780 --> 00:05:00,340
I think you can also, first question is that when you actually need to use a HPC cluster and even now

56
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,020
that's probably something you discussed already earlier today but just to remind you

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:14,580
supercomputer is not any machine which automatically makes everything faster.

58
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,580
So actually the supercomputer to be useful, you need to have some

59
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,580
parallelism in your scientific task.

60
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,580
Actually, if I take, I could say, pretty much any simulation or so

61
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,580
that runs on a single core and can fit to the memory of my laptop,

62
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,580
I'm pretty sure that my laptop would actually run faster

63
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,580
than any of the CSC supercomputers.

64
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,580
So you need to have something that runs parallelly.

65
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,580
Sometimes it also might just be that

66
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,580
you just need to run something for quite a long time

67
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,580
and because of that using your own workstation or laptop is not useful.

68
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Second thing might be that actually the problem you are trying to solve

69
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:16,980
needs lots of memory and that's something that the supercomputers can probably have much more memory.

70
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,700
Same goes for storage space. You need to deal with the terabytes of data.

71
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,620
That's most likely something you don't want to deal with your local port space.

72
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:42,820
One more reason to use CSC or some other HPC cluster is that the application you want to use,

73
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,700
it might be a commercial application that the principle user pays something for that, but the

74
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,420
CSC has actually bought the license for that, and in terms of the license, academic users can use

75
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,500
that free of charge. Or even though it might be an open source application, it might be something

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,340
which is a tedious install, have a lot of dependencies, and having data set ready to use

77
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,100
in a supercomputing system might be might be benefit. Regarding the data,

78
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,020
if you need to share data for other researchers, your colleagues, some of the services that CSC

79
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,420
provide might turn out to be useful and especially if you actually want to publish the data that's

80
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,820
that's something that I'm pretty sure it's very difficult for you to do in them according

81
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:47,060
all the principles on your own. Yeah we basically don't have our own long-term repositories and

82
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:55,220
say that's CSC's job. Yeah and I mean to get some DOEs for your data and I mean

83
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,700
something where other people can actually also cite your data if you if you share it.

84
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:12,260
So yeah this is why you might need CSC. You have something parallel, you need lots of memory

85
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:23,620
or storage-based application or data. You've already learned quite a bit about the university

86
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:31,620
clusters, so this question is of course that how do our computers actually differ from those?

87
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:40,420
And the answer is, from a user point of view, actually very little. The main difference really is in scale.

88
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:50,420
how many GPU cores, how many GPUs you can use, how much storage space you have, etc.

89
00:08:50,420 --> 00:09:00,420
As an example, in Mahti, or actually also in Lumi CPU Partition, you can, if you need,

90
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,420
you could be running something like 25,000 cores your simulation, or if you need to use

91
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:18,340
hundreds of GPUs that's in principle available in Lumi. The way you access

92
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,180
CSC supercomputers is pretty much the same as you would access for example Triton, I

93
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,700
mean you can use SSH from your terminal to get the command-line based

94
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,260
access and this is actually I realize a valid point I did not update I think

95
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:43,700
the web GUI, it's not really as such so new. So in some terms new service, but I mean that's

96
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:50,580
something we have had already for three years. And I think in Triton, how long you have actually had

97
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:57,860
that? A little bit, but it's only become a big thing in the last year. We've only really been

98
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:05,140
starting pushing it for basically the new Triton in the last month. So yeah. But once again,

99
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,740
then something that's also available there.

100
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,100
And I think especially for these web interfaces,

101
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,260
I mean, if you used in one system,

102
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,120
it's more or less same way to use that.

103
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,540
When using from command line,

104
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,380
we also have a module system to selecting compilers

105
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,540
and so on.

106
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,340
And in the batch queue system,

107
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,140
I think most of the supercomputing sites,

108
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,500
only CSC actually use Slurm.

109
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,420
So differences in usage are mainly

110
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,060
what are the partition names and et cetera.

111
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,880
So.

112
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Yeah.

113
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,980
One big difference of course is that

114
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,100
when you want to use CSC computing services,

115
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,900
you actually need to apply project for that

116
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,780
and you need to apply for some billing units

117
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,580
which you could think as CSC money or something like that.

118
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,860
And when you do competitions,

119
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,380
so actually nowadays also for data,

120
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,100
you have a lot of data on the disk

121
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,220
that also consume these billing units.

122
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,900
And it's one way we try to ensure

123
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,900
that the users actually think what they are doing.

124
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,060
It's often too easy.

125
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,980
I mean, I've been there, I've done that,

126
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,700
do some stupid things with the computer and waste resources, so that tries to assure that

127
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,740
users use the resources wise. Yeah, that's probably the biggest difference between

128
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,420
CSC and us. So for us, you just apply for the account, but you don't apply for or account for

129
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,300
individual resources separately, but there's no guaranteed amount available to you. At CSC,

130
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,140
you apply for the resources but there's much more available and

131
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,660
you're much more likely to get what you apply for within a quick time.

132
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,340
I'll come in the end of the presentation what is actually

133
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:15,660
what is needed for applying this and by the way in the way you you need

134
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,380
to apply for resources comes also that you typically also need

135
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,860
to report something especially I mean when you pre-apply some resources you

136
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,900
you need to somehow report that, what you use them for,

137
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,140
what kind of publication you make, and so.

138
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,980
Yeah.

139
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,540
Okay.

140
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,620
Then a bit about what are the computing,

141
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,220
or what kind of computing resources or services we have.

142
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,820
At the moment, we have two national supercomputers

143
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,820
which are available for basically to the users

144
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,140
users coming from Finnish universities and higher education institutions.

145
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,060
So we have Puhti and we have Mahti.

146
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,820
They both are actually in a sort of end part of their life.

147
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,860
So we are currently

148
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,060
or we have started already the sort of process of buying the next national

149
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,780
supercomputer, probably by the end of next year,

150
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:28,900
2025 Puhti and Mahtti will retire and we'll have a new system. What that's going to be,

151
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,180
I do not know and something we'll see with the negotiation with the vendors.

152
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,700
Puhti and Mahtti, they have a little bit different user profiles, so Puhti's,

153
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,260
you can somehow think that it's a bit more general purpose for smaller parallel jobs,

154
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:56,260
having Intel CPUs and some NVIDIA bit older generation GPUs,

155
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,260
MAHDI, SmartWave, Kietow Arts, medium and large scale

156
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:07,260
parallel simulations. For example, for most of the partitions,

157
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,260
the minimum number of CPU cores you are using,

158
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,380
using that single node, which it's in that system

159
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,380
with the AMD CPUs, it's always 128.

160
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,020
Mahti has also a little bit smaller GPU partition

161
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,340
than Puhti with the newer GPUs.

162
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,540
And what might be useful for some of you

163
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,500
for interactive workloads, development, and so on,

164
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,460
is that some of these GPUs can also actually be

165
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,100
slice the smaller ones so you do not, as the resources is a bit more limited, there are I

166
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,700
think only 24 of these nodes but for purposes where you do not need the full computational

167
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,340
power of single GPU you can get only a subset of that and do some useful stuff with that.

168
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:16,460
Then, as a sort of flagship, there is also LUMi. LUMi is actually not really a CSC supercomputer,

169
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:25,340
so it's actually truly a pan-European supercomputer, funding coming from the European Union and 11

170
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:33,980
countries belonging to Lumi Consortium, but it's hosted in the CSC data center.

171
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:42,460
User support is not directly given by CSC, so it's distributed to these Lumi Consortium countries,

172
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,380
but if you want to use that for Finnish users, you can access it via CSC

173
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,860
in applied resources a similar way as to Puhti and Matti.

174
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,580
Lumi at the moment is the most powerful supercomputer in Europe and the fifth most

175
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:13,420
powerful in the world, having over 10 000 AMD GPUs. So it's really a massive compute resource.

176
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:22,460
There is also a CPU part of that, which still is a quad-signal count, it's around 200,000

177
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,140
CPU cores also there.

178
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:36,340
Now with all this multitude of different supercomputers CSC has, you might ask, okay, which one of

179
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,700
these I should actually use?

180
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,700
And as I said, it really depends a bit on what kind of satellite task they have, a bit different profiles.

181
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:52,700
As I said, Puhti is maybe more for small or medium scale parallel tasks.

182
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,700
It has the most extensive software selection available,

183
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:08,700
while Mahti, as I said, is more for the larger parallel calculations.

184
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,660
duration of your of your simulation in

185
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,340
market the maximum time you get random

186
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,060
queue

187
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,220
and that's also a bit shorter than in

188
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,380
than in Puhti.

189
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,580
And Lumi I would say that

190
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,100
Lumi is really if you have an

191
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
application that can really benefit from

192
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,340
AMD GPUs

193
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,860
that's that's when you really should

194
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,700
consider Lumi.

195
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,100
Some projects you might might want to

196
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,340
run also the CPUs but

197
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:45,340
they do not provide that much advantage over Mahti. Software availability in Lumi is actually

198
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:54,300
a bit more limited, and talking about the module systems, the Cray module system that is in Lumi,

199
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,740
it's in some ways a bit more, in some cases, a bit more complicated to use than

200
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,140
the ones that we have in Puhti and Mahti, which are, I would say, more similar to Triton.

201
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:22,220
About the web interface, I'd say this is something that nowadays you can use all the three supercomputers,

202
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:32,580
either Puhti, Matti or Lumi, and here you can see the sort of selection of applications

203
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,260
within this web interface that you can use, for example,

204
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,420
in Puhti.

205
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,300
I think, personally, I use the Jupyter Notebooks a lot.

206
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,540
That's quite nice.

207
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,260
You can use it in MATLAB or RStudio.

208
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,500
That also might be quite convenient.

209
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,620
And if you need to use some graphical applications using

210
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,940
the NVIDIA web desktop might be also a good option.

211
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:06,940
In addition to the kind of traditional HPC services,

212
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,940
CSC provides also some cloud-like resources.

213
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,940
They might become useful if you have the operating system,

214
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,940
the system libraries and so on, that are available in supercomputers,

215
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,540
not always the latest possible. I mean the main objective for the for the

216
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,940
system is that it needs to be stable and sometimes you might need a bit more

217
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,660
flexibility. You really would like to run your own operating system or

218
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:47,100
things like that and for this kind of usage you might want to consider some of

219
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,260
the cloud services. Basically we have three types of cloud services. We have a

220
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:59,820
a CPoL as a general computing cloud, then I don't know, are

221
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:07,180
the Antisodius users doing genomics or things like that

222
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,860
where the data is actually sensitive?

223
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,140
Some are. We talked about that a bit on day one, and I think we

224
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,020
mentioned the CSC services, so here.

225
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,060
So for this kind of thing, there is the ePoL, and then there is

226
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:28,060
also this Pirate Container Cloud that can be useful for some things.

227
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,860
I heard that some of you earlier were

228
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,740
somehow interested but also about the programming.

229
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:41,180
I won't go in much details how to actually do the parallel programming use.

230
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,940
This is just the very brief overview what kind of

231
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,020
approaches one typically uses using supercomputers and I mean what

232
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:56,460
you can use in if you're using a CSC. So of course the basic C, C++, C, Fortran, Python,

233
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:03,340
Archulia. For parallel programming you can use MPI for distributed memory parallelism,

234
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,500
more openMP for shared memory. There are some high-performance libraries and GPUs.

235
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,980
If you're doing machine learning you might be using PyTorch or something like that which is

236
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,340
be readily available in the system or if you want to do the GPU graph on yourself

237
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:32,780
you might be using OpenMP offloading, OpenACC, CUDA, the HIP. CSC provides also some

238
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:40,940
performance analysis and debugging tools for parallel applications. So maybe you mention

239
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,940
this later but do you have training for all of these different types of things? Yes, I mentioned

240
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,380
bit of I'll come to try a little bit at the end of the talk.

241
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,180
The technical details I think I will now

242
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,780
skip but I'm in the end of slides so if you're interested you can

243
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,540
you can have some of the actual numbers checked there. You should find pretty

244
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,820
much the same information also from the CSC web pages or user

245
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,940
documentation. I'll include that also in the

246
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:19,580
presentation. Okay, let us come then to the other

247
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:25,020
aspect I mentioned that you might be dealing directly with

248
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,940
data or when you're doing the computations

249
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,620
and you're creating data that you would like to do also a little bit

250
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,100
more than just have it in the

251
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,940
in the file system in the supercomputer.

252
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,540
One data service we have is the ALLAS object storage

253
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:55,180
and you can upload the data from the supercomputer or actually from

254
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,180
anywhere so that's something the data which is in the

255
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,460
supercomputer file system or HPC file system

256
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,700
you can only access from the HPC system but the data you put in this object

257
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:14,380
storage you can in principle access from anywhere from the internet and you can also have the data

258
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:20,140
shared to other users. Lumi has actually its own optic storage also which is

259
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:30,140
it's a physically separate from that so if you you can use Allas either from Lumi or from

260
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,300
Mahti and Puhti. Lumi has this Lumi own object storage, which

261
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,860
similar you can actually use from from different places.

262
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,740
Okay.

263
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,780
CSC provides also some, I don't know if the data findable

264
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:54,500
accessible, interoperable, reusable is a concept common to

265
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,020
you. But basically it means that you can you can publish your

266
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,380
data set and together with the data set there is also

267
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,220
some metadata and there is also some tools for

268
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,260
searching these data sets so CSC has some services

269
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:18,420
for example EDA is one such a service that we provide.

270
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:27,420
Okay, training was already mentioned by [name].

271
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:35,420
So we have a quite a large amount of training every year in various aspects.

272
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,420
So supercomputing, just how to use our systems, might be related just to Puhti or Mahti,

273
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,420
might be related how to use Lumi,

274
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,180
might be some programming course of parallel programming

275
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,260
or might be just how to use certain static applications like

276
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,060
like Chromux.

277
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,700
There is also possible to get some help if you

278
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,860
have a data set that you would like to visualize.

279
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,780
Something more than just making your xy graphs.

280
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:15,300
CSC can provide help and for example you can develop your own

281
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,180
scientific application and would need some help in getting more

282
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,340
performance from that. That's something where CSC can also

283
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,980
help. Yeah so if someone say wants to learn

284
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,940
MPI program or OpenMP programming or GPU programming you have these

285
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,620
kind of courses? Or links to them from Lumi or something?

286
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Here are just examples of

287
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,700
some of the courses we are currently offering. So I think

288
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,580
if you're just want to learn a bit more about the

289
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,740
supercomputers in sort of general level, we have this

290
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,300
online course, Elements of Supercomputing, should be quite accessible and might be

291
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,580
and has been developed in principle for mostly people who don't necessarily have any previous

292
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:21,460
background of HPC, so it's quite general level. We have also this ongoing online course about

293
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:28,740
how to use CSC computing environment. We're going to have in the June-July time frame,

294
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,940
we have now for, I think this is now 13th time, we have in the summer school about high-performance

295
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:42,580
computing. That's a deadline for that has already passed, but that's sort of 10 days

296
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:50,500
is where you really go through all the basic aspects of how to

297
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,660
do parallel programming with the MPI, how to use OpenMP, how to

298
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:01,100
do GPU programming. So I think that's something if you if you

299
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,140
think that you will be doing a parallel program, something you

300
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,660
might want to look for in next year, I think that for next year

301
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,220
registration probably opens somewhere in January, February. Some of the courses we

302
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,740
already have in calendar of these hardware formats are in September.

303
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:32,140
Okay. Yeah, did you have some comment [name]? No, no, please continue. Okay, so all these

304
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:40,060
wonderful services we provide, so how you how you get to use them. First of all, similar to for

305
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:51,820
example Triton, you need to have an account and for CSC if you already have Haka available, I mean

306
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,980
you have been using Haka in your university, you can just go to my.csc.fi and with a few mouse

307
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:05,180
clicks you will get the csc user account. Username will probably be different.

308
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:12,620
Fast forward ssh keys so that you will be using the DNS cluster but you do not need any

309
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:20,860
really extra steps other than the account navigates. As discussed, in order to really

310
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:29,900
get some computational resources and use them there needs to be a project for that and you

311
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:39,180
one needs to apply billing units for the project and for that not not quite anybody can apply for

312
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:45,260
the project but on the other hand it doesn't have to be the big processor so basically

313
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:51,820
experienced researcher postdoc or something like that. I mean if you're doing some research work

314
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:58,620
there is typically some more experienced researcher that can apply for the project

315
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:06,860
and he or she can apply for billing unit and with the project the project manager can in principle

316
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:18,140
add any CSC user to the project. Maybe not so relevant for this audience but just to let you

317
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:26,140
know that if you're teaching a course and you want to use some CSC resources for that so that is also

318
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:34,780
possible to apply for a project for that. For courses you typically do not need to apply

319
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,980
billing units. So there is always a fixed amount of resources given there. The duration

320
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,740
is also typically fixed to six months, so it's a bit shorter too. And once a month

321
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,820
you need to then have the CSC account in order to actually use these resources within the

322
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
course.

323
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,780
Yeah. And I can say sometimes people come and ask us, oh, what do these questions mean

324
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:05,140
when applying for resources, but when in doubt, just send an email to the CSC service desk

325
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,860
or even in, if you're that brave, call and ask for details.

326
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:18,740
And I've always gotten good answers that way and, you know, some solution.

327
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,260
So yeah, it is some work, but don't be afraid.

328
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
Yeah.

329
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
Okay.

330
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:32,260
And I mean, when you have these questions, so yeah, we have the service desk.

331
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:38,180
If you go to our main webpages, you can actually find the phone numbers there, all the user

332
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,100
guides and so on.

333
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:46,180
You can go to indux.csc.fi, free data and so on, and all the trainings we have coming

334
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
there.

335
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,860
You can see there.

336
00:30:49,860 --> 00:31:00,420
So us, the Aalto Scientific Computing team here, we also do, we support CSC things,

337
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:08,180
if you bring questions to us. So maybe you wouldn't want to for things, but for example,

338
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:14,420
for using Lumi, our recommendation is to come to us and let us try to figure out how GPU stuff

339
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:22,180
works there and then you do it yourself. We have people come and asking about CSC virtual machines

340
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:33,620
or other small debugging things on CSC resources. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much what I have

341
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:41,460
to present and I mean if there are any still more questions or something like that I'm

342
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:51,980
happy to answer. Let's see, I'll flip to the notes here. So there was a question

343
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,140
where does the abbreviation CSC come from and from Finnish Wikipedia I see it

344
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,980
does come from Center for Scientific Computing decades ago. Decades ago and at

345
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,780
some point I think that was sort of abandoned. There was a time when

346
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,100
Then actually the official name was Center for Scientific Computing, and then at some

347
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,100
point, I don't know, somewhere, someone made the decision that, okay, now it's just CIC,

348
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,580
IT Center for Science, is what the original comes from.

349
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Yeah.

350
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,340
Which is more appropriate these days, anyway.

351
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:38,660
There's a question, my code is not using GPUs, so Lumi's only beneficial for GPU work.

352
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,660
Lumi, as said, it has also this CPU partition,

353
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,100
which, I mean, it's basically the same type of CPUs

354
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,300
than in Mahti, one generation newer.

355
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,060
I guess whether you should be using Lumi or Mahti

356
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:02,060
or Puhti in that case is really how...

357
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,700
Is it really just how big and where you're used to

358
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,500
and what has enough spare resources right now?

359
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Something like that, and sometimes it might be just a matter of that depending on time of year or whatever there is more free resources in one supercomputer than in another.

360
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Yeah.

361
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:36,500
I would say that for Finnish users having only CPU code marked is probably big.

362
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:44,180
I mean, for Volumio also, you can apply access via this my.csc.dev file.

363
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,180
But for some things, I would say that it's probably easier to work with.

364
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Yeah. Okay. Someone put in the notes here a pointer to the CSC weekly user support session.

365
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Ah, that's actually, yeah.

366
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,180
This is really good. It's like our daily garage at Aalto.

367
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:11,180
So you can go there and ask questions and join some experts and figure out stuff live.

368
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,220
Yeah definitely something I should add also to the slide something we

369
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:22,140
we already had for quite some time but yeah that's that's true something I mean there was this that

370
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:27,340
okay you you can send email and but I mean this is this is a member Wednesday you can just online

371
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:37,020
join and hopefully be like a low barrier place to ask questions. Yeah and so is CSC a non-profit

372
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:46,620
organization, or is it a company? Yes, yes. We are a private company, but a special company,

373
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,860
non-profit company. We're actually not allowed to make any real profit than a

374
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:57,500
sale loan by the Ministry of Education, so. Okay, yeah, yeah. We are here to make the world a better

375
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:04,380
place, not to make money. Yeah, and yes, our taxes go to supporting CSC, just like they go to

376
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,540
supporting research because CSC is part of research.

377
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,140
Yes, exactly. Anyway, yeah, thank you very much for coming. I

378
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,860
guess UC can stay around in the

379
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,580
notes and answer any further questions that appear there.

380
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:31,260
I'll just put it in the chat with UC. So yeah, thanks a lot and

381
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,140
see you next year or maybe before next year.

382
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,260
Yeah, we'll see.

383
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,380
Yeah, OK.

384
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,380
Thanks a lot.

385
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,540
Bye.

386
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,000
Bye.
