1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Bye.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,780
OK, so now about connecting to a cluster.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,820
Essentially, there are many, many different ways

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,260
how you connect, how you can connect.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,580
and it also depends a bit on what cluster you're trying to connect to, what things are being

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:26,420
offered. We are mainly focusing here on the options that we give at Aalto, so with Triton,

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:35,780
but most of them are also applicable for other HPC systems. The traditional way to connect

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:44,660
to a cluster is essentially SSH. You have a command line tool, be that Windows command

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:53,340
line, Windows PowerShell, the WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux on a Windows machine or

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:03,540
on any terminal on a Linux or Mac machine, and using the SSH command, which is just secure

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,540
a shell which lets you connect to a cluster.

12
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,980
Maybe we can just show that quickly.

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,420
Yep.

14
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,540
I've opened a Windows command prompt.

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,780
Let me see, you should be able to see it.

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,580
So it's SSH and there will be.

17
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,580
Your username?

18
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,260
triton.aalto.fi, in the case of Triton.

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,220
In the case of Triton or in the case of Aalto, you need to be connected to the virtual private

20
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:55,060
network or have SSH keys set up, but for this demo, [name], it's connected to the VPN?

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,540
Yep.

22
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,160
And then, where am I here now?

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
It says Login4.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,720
Where is this on the cluster?

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:11,040
So essentially, what you get to when you connect to a cluster is not one of the compute machines.

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,920
It's normally a login node, which is kind of a control node where you submit jobs, where

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,580
you send jobs to the cluster, which will be discussed about later.

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,580
important thing to know about this is that this logger node is not a place

29
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,500
where you should actually run computations because on most systems

30
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,180
your resources that you can use on the logger node are restricted and if they

31
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,100
are in use you might really get problems actually connecting again to the cluster

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:55,180
because if the let's say 10 gigabytes of memory or so that you are allocated and

33
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,340
the two CPUs are in full use by some Python computation process even your

34
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,500
terminals might start to become really sluggish or not react at all

35
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,180
because you don't have more resources on this machine because it's a shared

36
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:19,540
resource and everyone should be should be able to work on there without the risk of someone saying

37
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,500
okay I'm just running a computation here and slowing it down for everyone. So this is just

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:35,700
the place where you connect to and where you start then distributing the work and we can also

39
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:46,980
maybe quickly show this via OnDemand. OnDemand is a service that also

40
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,220
many HPC systems nowadays provide and it's essentially a web interface to the cluster.

41
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,020
On Triton, it's ondemand.triton.aalto.fi.

42
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,260
So then, when I open this.

43
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:15,300
And commonly, you can get a shell access there, you can get a desktop access.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,580
And there's one big difference here.

45
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:26,100
If you want the shell, if you get shell access on Triton, this is, again, just a shell, so

46
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,280
a command line for the login node.

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,560
Essentially, exactly the same as what we

48
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,900
had with the terminal connection earlier.

49
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,440
But if you would request a desktop session,

50
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
that's commonly a job that is actually

51
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,980
running on one of the compute nodes.

52
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:02,580
So that's, if you request a desktop or interactive graphical session, that is normally

53
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:11,540
some type of job on the node where you can also then run computations and similar things in a

54
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,540
user interface way. Which is why you need to define the resources that you want there.

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,100
And then you maybe need to wait a little while. Yeah. Another important note here is that

56
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,980
very often these interactive resources are rather limited.

57
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
And the reason for that is that

58
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,980
interactive resources on tendency are kind of inefficient

59
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
in the sense that

60
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,980
you are very often sitting in front of this and thinking.

61
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,980
And that means the whole time you're thinking about something,

62
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,980
the computational power of whatever you requested

63
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,980
is idling on tendency.

64
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,980
If it's currently running something, then that's fine, but very often

65
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,980
it's just idling. For heavy

66
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,980
computation jobs, you normally need to go through

67
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,980
the queue system and submit jobs that are explicitly

68
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,980
just running one thing. It's also this UI and the

69
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,740
whole user interface thing, of course, takes resources.

70
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,580
So you are essentially spending some resources

71
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,220
just to have this UI.

72
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,380
And if you want to have an as efficient job as possible,

73
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,540
getting rid of that overhead is definitely beneficial.

74
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,100
So it's actually not good for what the cluster's made for,

75
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,260
namely running big computations.

76
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
But if you have results on the cluster

77
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,380
that you want to just quickly check,

78
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,020
you use it as one way to have a graphical user interface

79
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,020
to look at the figures or something that would be produced.

80
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,180
And that's well connected to the cluster

81
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,300
in contrast to trying to mount this remotely

82
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,100
where network connections might be slower and so on.

83
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,860
Yes, and it's available also from outside.

84
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,540
So you don't have to be on the VPN or close by.

85
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,260
Yeah, there's one last way

86
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,620
that we want to quickly show

87
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,020
because it has become quite popular recently

88
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,260
and that's VSCode.

89
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,380
VSCode has a couple of features,

90
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,260
mainly one extension that's called the Remote SSH plugin.

91
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,380
So I look for remote SSH like this.

92
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:51,380
SSH like this, there it is, and I can install it.

93
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,860
With that plugin, you can essentially do an SSH connection almost the same way as you

94
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,300
would do it with the shell.

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,020
When you have installed this, you will see this remote explorer icon.

96
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,960
You can then either add or [name] already has it added.

97
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,540
So you can add it by clicking the plus on this H to tell new remote or if you already

98
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:27,560
have one, you can go on that and essentially indicate location.

99
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:38,300
If you wanted to add, you would add this, like the same command at Triton.

100
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:51,460
And why we want to show the VS Code in particular is there are a few issues with VS Code.

101
00:08:51,460 --> 00:09:01,260
It can be a great tool, but if you connect to a cluster with VS Code, on general principle,

102
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:08,980
never open a folder or never connect opening a folder that has lots and lots of files in

103
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,500
there.

104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Open things that actually have code and not data.

105
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,820
And also don't open, for example, your home folder.

106
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:30,760
And the reason for this is that if you would do that, VS Code tries to index files that

107
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,100
are in the folder, and it does this for all files in the folder, which means that it will

108
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,000
constantly ask, has this file changed, has this file changed?

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,820
And if you do this for a folder that has a lot of files in there, you are essentially

110
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,420
starting to run a small denial-of-service attack on the file system servers that are

111
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,260
around on the cluster.

112
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,620
Please don't do that.

113
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:09,340
So that's why we want to mention here that, yeah, use the subfolder that actually has your

114
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,820
code to connect to it and use it like that.

115
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,100
One more thing with VS Code,

116
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,900
in general, try not to run VS Code Jupyter Notebooks.

117
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,540
Because VS Code, essentially,

118
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,920
when you use this remote SSH plugin,

119
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,260
it starts a VS Code server on the other side.

120
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,900
If you have Jupyter Notebooks open on the other side,

121
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,900
that is not being closed, that is not being shut down when you disconnect.

122
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,400
The server will keep running.

123
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,900
And that means if you have computations done in that Jupyter Notebook,

124
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,900
you still have this running and you're running this on the logger node.

125
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:05,900
So, when you use VS Code, try not to use Jupyter Notebooks interactively.

126
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:14,460
So, is it that I shouldn't even open this ipynb file?

127
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,740
That I think depends a little bit on the plugins that you actually have installed.

128
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:31,220
But I personally wouldn't edit Jupyter Notebooks on VS Code with the remote SSH plugin.

129
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:39,260
You can potentially run VS Code on a cluster node and do things like that, but I wouldn't

130
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,100
do it on the remote SSH.

131
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,340
But with that, I think we will stop here to leave enough time for questions, for individual

132
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:58,020
questions if things don't work during connection, so that we can get as many of you as possible

133
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:11,060
it on the cluster and connect it to the cluster. People from Aalto or Helsinki should all have

134
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:20,500
a link to Zoom where we can help with connecting to their respective clusters. I think we will

135
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,460
to pause the stream here now till 11 finish time.

136
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,780
Or is it no?

137
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,220
Wait.

138
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,460
Yeah, essentially till 11 Finnish time

139
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,860
and allow people to try to get connected to the cluster.

140
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,340
OK, so yeah, we're going to the break time.

141
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,620
So yeah, so this is the first exercise time.

142
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,940
So we will mute the stream.

143
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,700
We will go to the notes here.

144
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,420
You see there's lots of questions

145
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,980
that have been asked about this.

146
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,100
We'll put in the bottom a little thing that says what

147
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,020
you should be doing right now.

148
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,780
So yes, there are lots of things that can go wrong here. Don't worry. Don't be afraid.

149
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,780
You can keep asking questions here. If you're in Finland, we have a Zoom that you can join,

150
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,260
and we have breakout rooms for some universities there, and you can ask for live help. And

151
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,660
remember, if you don't have time before the next presentation starts, there's still two hours until

152
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,220
we actually start doing stuff on the cluster. So you can keep asking questions in the notes

153
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,180
during the time. We'll try to figure out what can happen. If you're at Aalto you can send us

154
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:04,140
emails to the addresses and we can look because you shouldn't be adding your usernames to this

155
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:18,220
document. Yeah, and good luck! Now you have time to read stuff. Okay, talk to you later then. Bye!

156
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,740
Let's see, hello, hopefully you can hear me out there.

157
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,340
So now we're going to a break pretty quickly.

158
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,140
So if you look at the notes here,

159
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,740
you see there's many questions happening.

160
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,460
So that just goes to show how hard it

161
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,260
can be to even get connected to the cluster.

162
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,940
So I wouldn't say it's necessarily hard,

163
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,420
just there's so many different things for everyone. Where you are, what university you are,

164
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,460
how you're trying to connect, how your computer is set up, is your account new or old, and so on.

165
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:02,180
So, like we said before, if you can't do it now, it's okay. You're welcome to keep watching the

166
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:09,620
course. Next, we have a demo of the cluster after a short break. A demo of a cluster from CSC,

167
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:23,820
see. So you still have more time to work on this. What else? Yeah. And you notice here

168
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:33,520
in the notes, there's this little poll here. So you can add an O to done if you finished.

169
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,540
If you couldn't get connected, then you could put an O under trying connected and an O under

170
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,700
not trying if you weren't even trying, and that way we can sort of see what the status is.

171
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,820
Yeah, overall, basically, don't worry. If this seems hard, it's one of the hardest parts,

172
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:02,460
unfortunately, and just keep coming back. Don't worry. And with that, see you in 10 minutes

173
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,580
for the next session, bye.
