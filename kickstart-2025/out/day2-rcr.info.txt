2.6 Responsible computational research - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

Doing research comes with responsibilities, how to make sure the principles of research integrity are translated into scientific computing practices? We present a short structured view of ethical and legal considerations in computational research in Europe, with an extra overview of responsible use of generative AI for writing code.

02:10 The normative cascade
03:39 Level 1: foundational ethical principles in research
05:23 EU legislation and regulations that can affect research
07:00 National and university-level guidelines
07:34 Researchers
08:28 Responsible research in practice
16:16 Generative AI considerations
