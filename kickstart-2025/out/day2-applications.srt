1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
So yes.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,920
Well, I guess the purpose here isn't

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,920
to talk about specific applications.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,440
But if you're using a cluster, you want to run something.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,080
And it's either an application someone else has installed,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,160
or it's something that you need to install yourself.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,400
Or for example, you need to install Python or something

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
and then run your own code.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,640
And this is just a very broad overview of what's available.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,360
Since everyone needs different stuff, we're not going to take the time to go into any detail

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,600
here because most people would be bored and you will need to find it again when you need it anyway.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,040
But this is the general idea. So some people come to the cluster and say, why can't I do

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,280
sudo apt-get install something, which is the command you would use on a Linux computer to

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,520
install something. And there's several reasons, but the most important of the reasons is that

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,640
this is a shared cluster. And if you can install something or change the version of something,

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,440
then it will break it for everyone else. And even if us as admins do stuff,

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,800
any little change we do has the possibility of breaking someone else's code.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,080
So it's very conservative what's installed as part of the operating system.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,720
So if we go down, that's us.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,680
So yeah, there's a few things we install that way.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,200
But for the most part,

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,760
anything you need is not just available by default.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,320
Yeah. Maybe demo in the terminal a few of these applications.

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,560
So many, at least here in Aalto,

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,920
The computing cluster, all of the computers are very minimal installations, so they don't

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,640
have a lot of software installed, because they're not installed into any disk or anything

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
when the computer is booted up.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,080
Everything is in memory, and this is quite common in many clusters, so the whole operating

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,960
system is in memory, and the more you have in the memory, the less.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,920
The more stuff you have in the operating system, the less you have memory available for the

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
users.

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,560
So that's why usually the image is very small.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,880
But there's some programs there.

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:38,360
So if we, for example, look which Python 3, so which is this tool that checks, like if

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,120
I would run Python 3, what is the actual application that will run?

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,040
So we noticed that this is, it comes from user bin.

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,640
So this is like, Linux has this file systems through the operating system.

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Yeah.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,840
Linux has this file system hierarchy where like user is the applications, the operating

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,960
system applications there and bin is usually like the executable binaries.

41
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:11,280
So it's part of the operating system, but we want to still run multiple things in the cluster.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,920
So often, we admins install stuff into the cluster

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,200
and make it available for many of the users.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
Yes.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,320
And we do that with, well, the most common one

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,080
is called the module system.

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,560
And this is a way you can run a command,

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,680
and it makes other software available by manipulating

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,000
the paths it looks at for software.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,400
And we don't need to go into depth about exactly where this

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,640
comes from and how it works.

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,680
But can you give one example, then?

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,440
Yeah, let's check if we have MATLAB available.

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:04:01,160
So if we run this module spider MATLAB,

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,520
yeah, we can first check if we have it.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,200
And it says there's no MATLAB anywhere.

57
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
OK, yeah.

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
So if we now run module spider matlab,

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,360
so this module spider is a tool that it checks like,

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,760
is there, like, can you find matlab in the modules?

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,200
You can just run module spider to run you

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,680
all of the available modules.

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,440
But you notice that now we see that there's multiple

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
versions of matlab available over here.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Yes.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
You see that there's matlab

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
and then there's like multiple versions.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,800
So let's pick one of those versions.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,920
So let's pick the latest one.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Maybe that one.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
Maybe the latest one.

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,640
And we can press Q to quit, and then module load,

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,240
and then give that name.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,340
So I paste it once.

75
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,160
And what happens?

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Looks like nothing.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,640
Well, yeah.

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,600
But we still, if you are on module list,

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,560
yeah, module list shows what modules are loaded.

80
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,960
So we can see that there's now the MATLAB module is loaded.

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,160
There's also this kind of like environment module.

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,120
So many of, many clusters have this kind of like

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,560
overall yearly installations or something

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,320
and we have them now too.

85
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,220
So it makes a lot of software available for you.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,600
And it makes it possible to install a lot of other software.

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:40,000
But let's now check which MATLAB, did we actually get MATLAB, so okay, now we see.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,400
Manual installation software MATLAB, yeah, okay.

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,400
So there's now like a system installed MATLAB.

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,640
So this is the most common way that we provide software or the system providers provide software

91
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
for you.

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,400
Maybe we can start the MATLAB and test it.

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,840
let's try that. Let's see, I hope it doesn't do something weird.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah, we started with the no JDM so that we don't want the graphical interface. But yeah,

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,920
you can see that this is the muscle. It returns. Yeah, okay, so that worked.

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay, and what's available in the module system? What kind of stuff do we have there?

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, a huge bunch of software. There's many libraries, many finished software installations

98
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,620
and all sorts of stuff. So you can find it in the applications page and running module

99
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:55,160
spider will give you more information on that. But we also have some very specific software.

100
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,360
So this might be, again, like some of this

101
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,000
is also only auto-specific.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,920
You want to check your cluster's stuff, how they are doing.

103
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,240
But one for whatever, is it safe to say

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,960
what every cluster you have, the first thing to do

105
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,560
is read the documentation for what you need

106
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,120
and see if it's already installed

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,680
or there's special instructions, because it

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,640
will be different for everyone.

109
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,900
Yeah, especially for the very complex programs,

110
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,640
there might be a specific reason why

111
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,280
installed the way they are. And the admins have used a lot of effort trying to get the most

112
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,040
like performant version and most stable version installed to the system. And doing it manually

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,440
by yourself can be quite tricky sometimes. Yeah. Okay.

114
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:50,920
Should we demo? We could demo a few more software. So we have in our

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,920
So in our cluster, we also have these containers available.

116
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,340
So there was, yesterday at least,

117
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,740
there was a question about like what,

118
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,660
can you run Docker containers in the cluster?

119
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,500
So containers, for those who don't know,

120
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,540
is this basically like an operating system

121
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,540
paired with the software, like everything is there.

122
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,900
Like everything is contained in the same package.

123
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,540
And we use these apptainer containers,

124
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,500
or they used to be called singularity containers.

125
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,660
They are called, in some sites, singularity containers

126
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,260
to have these kind of very complex software

127
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,460
that wouldn't install into the operating system

128
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,900
that we're using.

129
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,200
So, but these can be run in the cluster,

130
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,140
and we have a few of these available.

131
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,140
They need usually a bit more manual work to get working,

132
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:56,220
But in the notes, we'll link a course page with Code Refinery that we did on creating

133
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,620
these containers. So if you are interested in this, please check that material.

134
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:11,580
And on Triton, at least we do have some software already installed in containers.

135
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,700
So it's not just, despite what it says here, it's not just under install it yourself.

136
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,820
So yeah.

137
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,780
But should we give a demo of running stuff,

138
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,300
something with a container?

139
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,940
Yeah.

140
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,860
Yeah, let's look at it.

141
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,180
So one example is this FreeSurfer,

142
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,140
which is this Neo4j imaging suite, which

143
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,740
is they provide existing containers.

144
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,060
So it's easiest to install using that.

145
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,180
So for that, we have this module,

146
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,540
apptainer-freesurfer.

147
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,460
So if you load that, it will tell you

148
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,460
how to get more information on how to run it.

149
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:59,500
But we have read it, so [name] can maybe execute the command.

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,460
And is this a typo here?

151
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,300
Should that be a curly bracket?

152
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,220
Oh, that's true.

153
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,940
Yes, good point.

154
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,780
We need to fix that.

155
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,540
So now we run it with aptainer execute,

156
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,420
and I guess the path to it?

157
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,140
Yeah, the mesh path.

158
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,620
And then we execute some program inside of it.

159
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,340
So this is running.

160
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,820
So if I can unpack this command, apptainer's the container

161
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,580
program.

162
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,300
Exec means we want to run some command in a container.

163
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,020
Image path has been defined by the module that tells me

164
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,660
this is where the container is.

165
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,300
And if you make a container yourself,

166
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,980
you would just give it the path there directly.

167
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,700
Yeah.

168
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,380
And FreeSurfer is now a thing that will run inside of there.

169
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,260
So it's like it's starting up this other, almost

170
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,780
like an operating system that's self-contained with all

171
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,860
the stuff, and then says, hey, you, this box I just made,

172
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,140
run FreeSurfer.

173
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,660
And it connects it to what's outside.

174
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,420
Yes.

175
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,340
Yes, very well.

176
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,700
And I guess we can run it with the Help option

177
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,700
to verify that it does something in there.

178
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:15,340
And it sure looked like it gives us help from it.

179
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,620
And I guess if we do FreeSurfer outside the container,

180
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,420
there's nothing.

181
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,020
So yeah, OK.

182
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,100
Are there any other big, major ways of software?

183
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,940
I guess there's Conda that we already

184
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,780
went over in the morning.

185
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,820
So actually, what is the most common way of doing things?

186
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,740
Yeah, well, that's, at least in the Python world,

187
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,900
it's quite common.

188
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,260
But for many people who don't necessarily

189
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,780
like who want to use Python, but they don't necessarily

190
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,380
want to do stuff themselves or install their own environment,

191
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,020
we provide existing environments that

192
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,200
are like handcrafted to have a huge bunch of packages

193
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,560
available, at least here in Alta.

194
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,480
So we have this SciComp Python environment

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,240
that has a lot of packages already installed.

196
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,080
But of course, you can create your own environments.

197
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,120
So maybe we should demo that quickly, loading that.

198
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,640
Demo, ah, so the pre-made content things, yes, OK.

199
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,480
Yes.

200
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,080
And I have a visitor here.

201
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,000
So let's see how much I could type.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,360
So module load.

203
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,200
And I know from my experience that it is called `scicomp-python-env`.

204
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,520
And what's in this environment?

205
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,320
A huge bunch of Python packages he installed already.

206
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,120
So now we can see that the Python has changed.

207
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,680
Like, what is the Python version that we're using?

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,880
It comes from our installation.

209
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
But like, yeah, these are something that we provide,

210
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,880
but there's a lot of stuff you can, of course, install yourself.

211
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,520
And if you encounter any problems, it's always a good idea to ask help

212
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,160
from the admins, or if you know a software

213
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,240
that other people might be interested in using,

214
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,000
it might be good to let us know, then we can install it for everybody.

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,600
in the cluster because that's that makes it life easier for everybody.

216
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,360
Yeah, and even if you aren't sure about it, you can ask. So there'll be sometimes we'll say,

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,040
okay, yeah, I mean, we haven't had many requests from this. It seems easier to install yourself

218
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,560
and we'll help you install it yourself. But as we see the patterns, we might add it to one of the

219
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,640
existing environments, especially if it's a Python or R thing, install it within one of these. If it's

220
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,640
it's LLM-related, install it to our standard LLM environment.

221
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,880
Yeah.

222
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,720
Yeah.

223
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,880
So, and depending on your, yeah,

224
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,640
but usually like as a good rule of thumb,

225
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,720
go check out module spider in the cluster

226
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,760
that you're running in and check what's there

227
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,560
and it's your program that you're planning on running there.

228
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
That's a good starting point usually.

229
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,680
and check the application page for the program.

230
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,240
But I think now is a good time to switch gears,

231
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,480
to talk about, like we have a talk by [name and [name].

232
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,240
And I think the cat is getting pretty hungry,

233
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,240
so it's a great time to switch.

234
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,740
Yeah.

235
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:04,740
There is this interesting question about using Python 2 on Triton.

236
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,100
So that's one of the cases where we'd say it's not installed in any default environment,

237
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,060
but you can install it yourself with Conda.

238
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,140
And then we point you that way and give you any help you might need.

239
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,420
And that's that basically.

240
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,700
Yeah. But also, I would say that if you have to run some Python 2 code, that's the least

241
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:33,180
of your worries. It's been deprecated for so long that transitioning to Python 3 in

242
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:41,780
that code might be... Asking people supporting you, can they help with the transition process

243
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,060
from Python 2 to Python 3 might be a good worthwhile investment.

244
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,940
Yeah, but I mean, if it's some code that they haven't made

245
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,780
and someone else is like, yeah, you just

246
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,020
aren't going to update that.

247
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,580
But yeah, OK, so with that said, let's close this out.

248
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,740
There's a lot more to read about applications.

249
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,300
We've just prepared you to do your own reading.

250
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,100
So by all means, go do that.

251
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,260
And if you have questions about the application of your choice,

252
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,580
put them into the notes, and we can try to answer, like,

253
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,060
well, how it should go about installing.

254
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,100
Keep writing there.

255
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,620
And now we're switching gears for the second to last session

256
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,620
of the day, which is a more philosophical discussion,

257
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,140
I guess.

258
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,220
So it's more about how you use stuff.

259
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,660
Or no, not how you use stuff, about how

260
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,540
you do the science itself.

261
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,580
And this is with [name], who's one of our, well,

262
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,620
I want to say one of the reproducibility people.

263
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,580
But really, we all care about reproducibility in science.

264
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,220
So anyway.

265
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,740
Yes.

266
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,300
Yeah, have a good one.

267
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,580
Thanks.

268
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,380
Can you switch to my share?

269
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,340
Screen share, please.

270
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,000
There you go.
