2.3 Array jobs - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

When there is no dependency or communication among the individual program runs, these individual runs can be run in parallel on separate Slurm jobs called array jobs.  These are very useful and used often, including with other types of parallelism.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
