3.3 LLMs - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

We go over the use of large language models on a computer cluster. First, we talk about the general types of AI tools we have at Aalto University, and then the pre-installed code and models we have.  While this is Aalto-specific, the general principles will apply other places as well.

00:00 Overview of various AI tools available at Aalto
03:34 LLMs on the cluster
15:31 Demos (LLMs on the cluster)

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
