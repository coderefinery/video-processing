1.6 Slurm: the queueing system - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

Slurm is the "workload manager" or queuing system which manages all the resources.  It takes requests for jobs (CPU, memory, time, etc) and schedules them among all of the rest of the cluster. We discuss the basics of this system and we'll see how it actually works soon.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
