2.4 Monitoring jobs (summary) - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

In order to use large amounts of resources, you need to be able to monitor how many resources you used, so that you can properly adjust the resources you request later.  We go over the main parts: output during the job, time, memory efficiency, CPU efficiency, GPU efficiency, and so on.

We have already seen most of the content there, but we summarize everything now in one place.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
