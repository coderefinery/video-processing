3.1 How to ask for help with (super)computers - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

It’s dangerous to go alone, take us! Don’t waste time struggling, there are plenty of people here for you.  This talk gives you an insight into how to ask good questions, when to ask, and who would be answering and trying to help you.

Right before this lesson, we had a technical problem (internet outage) and thus had to switch broadcast computers.  Thus, we had to change broadcaster on short notice, but it worked.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.
