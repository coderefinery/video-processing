2.5 Applications and Modules: software on the cluster - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

Software installation is one of our most time-consuming tasks in supporting cluster usage.  In "Applications", we'll talk about the general principles of managing software on the cluster: can you install things?  Do you need to ask us?  Do both happen at the same time?  Then we look at the `module` command that lets you make other pre-installed software available.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
