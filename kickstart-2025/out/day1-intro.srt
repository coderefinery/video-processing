1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,780
the intro. So, welcome to Introduction to Scientific Computing and HPC. Very briefly,

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,460
what is this course about? Well, it's structured over three days and we kind of gradually build

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,780
on the skills, on the basic skills that are needed for basically scaling up your computations. So,

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,620
in Finland, and also for those of you who are not in Finland, most likely you

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,580
have access to an high-performance computing cluster, which basically means lots and lots

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:41,580
of servers connected by a very fast network so that they can run lots of computations.

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,020
And it might well be that you don't need thousands of servers connected in parallel,

8
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,620
but what is useful is that you can just request one for yourself, do your work in a secure way,

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,500
and then happily, you know, continue with publishing paper and things like that.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,860
So who is attending this workshop, this course? Well, there's multiple people

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,020
from multiple universities. We are very happy that today with us, beyond Aalto

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,020
University, there's also Helsinki University and Oulu University, but in general we

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,700
span across borders. We have people from all over the Nordics, Europe and even

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,020
beyond so the practicalities this is not your typical kind of zoom workshop or

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,140
zoom course where we are all in the in the same zoom here we use this type of

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,580
live stream strategy which you can understand that it's very useful because

17
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:43,300
this is like a TV studio and we're like all watching the TV together and by

18
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,500
doing this we can make sure that we can provide immediately high quality

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,920
recordings of all the training that we have today and more broadly you will later see

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,500
that everything is to be stored in our YouTube channel so that you can re-watch something

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,100
that we're going to mention in these days but also sometimes we don't cover things that

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,540
we have already covered well in the past and so there's more videos that we will refer

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,820
to.

24
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:20,500
The communication with the instructors happens through this type of asynchronous chat and

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,400
you can understand already that this is much better than something like the Zoom chat which

26
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,960
makes it impossible to communicate with this type of shared document that we are all editing.

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,900
Right now there's 105 people editing it in parallel.

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,960
You can basically ask questions and then maybe some of you could answer or one of the helpers

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,980
can answer and so on. At the end this document basically forms a nice diary of the whole

30
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,200
day which will then archive and you can later go back to it and check it. As you might have

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,960
already tested this once you open the link that you have received in your registration

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,800
email there's a pencil at the top, the screenshot there is showing that. By clicking on the

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,160
pencil basically you enter the edit mode and then you're able to add the text

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,120
where you need to add it. The share document is powerful but of course if

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,200
there's hundreds of people editing in parallel it can be you know challenging

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,440
even to just type so if you're if you know that you don't need to write

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,520
anything you can switch back to the view mode by clicking that eye icon so that

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,600
you know the load of the service is is smaller and other people can write freely

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Right. So where do we focus or where to focus because you can understand that there's different windows and

40
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,660
In general focus on the on the streaming on the twitch TV window

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,220
We provide this type of vertical

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,700
layout so that, as you can see in the picture there,

43
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,620
you can kind of keep the Twitch window

44
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,540
on one side of your laptop screen, for example,

45
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,940
and then you can keep, let's say,

46
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,540
this notes document in another browser window

47
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,820
or your terminal.

48
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,140
We would use a lot the terminal

49
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,700
to connect to the remote cluster.

50
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,460
Of course, if you have multiple screens,

51
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,060
then you don't have these issues,

52
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,940
but we are thinking for those of you

53
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,140
who are working with a laptop

54
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,420
so that they have enough desktop space to arrange all the windows together.

55
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,500
Maybe one thing that I did not mention when it comes to Twitch.tv streaming,

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,700
it is important that you set the bandwidth to basically source,

57
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,580
which means the same bandwidth of the original broadcasting stream.

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,900
Otherwise, Twitch will do some sort of compression,

59
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,460
and so things will start to get blurry.

60
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,980
but if you make it so that the bandwidth

61
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,700
is basically the maximum available,

62
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
you will see the stream.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,940
All right, anything else that we are missing?

64
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,980
Yeah, maybe on the learning styles

65
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,900
that there's many learning styles.

66
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,940
I think in general, we've been running this

67
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,300
kind of new way of online teaching for a few years.

68
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,140
We really like the fact that it can happen

69
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,140
at everybody's, at anyone's pace.

70
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,700
Those who want to learn live with us,

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,300
they can watch right now.

72
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,420
Some others might learn later.

73
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,020
And when we chat with our previous course participants,

74
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,440
some people find this also useful months after,

75
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,640
so they can go back to the stream,

76
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,100
watching the videos, checking the notes document.

77
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,760
In general, to conclude,

78
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,500
when it comes to the community and to good rules,

79
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,340
let's just try to be respectful.

80
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,260
At Aalto, we have our code of conduct

81
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,260
any universities we have a good code of conduct. If you see some inappropriate

82
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,820
behavior just let us know and we can do the best to kind of you know compensate

83
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:13,660
for that or make sure that it doesn't happen. There's few things that could go

84
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,300
wrong but usually they don't get wrong. In general if you feel that there's too

85
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,700
much information coming in too short time it's totally normal especially if

86
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,020
it's the first time that you work with this type of HPC systems but this is why

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,040
it's it's it's great to have everything recorded and you can later you know

88
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,280
rewatch at your own pace if the notes are too fast to follow don't worry you

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,300
don't need to follow the notes you don't need to you know we basically will

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,300
highlight some important notes on the on the stream and then again later you can

91
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,180
always go back to the notes and have a look.

92
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,220
I already mentioned this that sometimes if there's too many people editing at the same

93
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,820
time the notes document might feel slow so please switch to the view mode and we won't

94
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,900
have time to cover everything so some of the materials that are linked in our main page

95
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,380
course page are actually videos from previous rounds of this course or there's other videos

96
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,260
for example this kitchen metaphor to HPC, in general we encourage you to, you know,

97
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,340
explore all the materials we have and what we will show here in these 10 hours together is kind of,

98
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:40,660
you know, a small or a large subset of all the materials. What else? Well, we try not to deviate

99
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:48,020
from the schedule but you know things happen and when it comes to possible technical issues

100
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,140
it has happened only once that the whole internet collapsed during the streaming hopefully

101
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,660
the internet will be up again but eventually if something goes wrong just wait a little bit and

102
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,140
the stream might come back or then you will receive another email from me saying that

103
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,620
I don't know, we could have a plan B. All right, well I guess maybe the most

104
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,860
important thing is to mention that the cat, [name]'s cat, will visit the stream.

105
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,780
I think it's too early now. Is the cat still sleeping, [name]?

106
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,820
Yeah, it's in the room but sleeping. It's usually later in the afternoon,

107
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,980
so motivation to stay to the end.

108
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,580
Exactly. All right, well, final notes. Everything is recorded. Credits I think

109
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,340
already wrote in the notes that for this course specifically we don't give credits

110
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:46,020
and at the very bottom there's a link to our mailing list and for those of you who have ticked

111
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,420
in the registration that you would like to hear about future courses you will be added to this

112
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,000
mailing list and now it's exactly 10 past 10 so I'm happy to pass the ball back to [name]
