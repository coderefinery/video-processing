1.2 The HPC Kitchen - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

A computer cluster, or "supercomputer" may seem like some powerful thing, but it's composed of a lot of relatively normal computers. It can be hard to wrap your head around what this means, so we present a clear metaphor to cooking.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
