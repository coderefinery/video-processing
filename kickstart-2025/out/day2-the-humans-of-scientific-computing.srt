1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
all that. Yeah. What's the point? Yeah. But anyway, now it's time to begin.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,760
Right. Let's see, what do I do? I scroll down. So

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,480
we already have some questions here that people are answering. So welcome to day two of the

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,800
course. We start with something we've done for a few years, which is a quick, I guess

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
I guess you could call it an interview, but it's not really.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,520
I guess it is, technically.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,640
So we talk to different people that

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,920
work on our team or similar teams

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,320
and hear about their careers, how they got where they are,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,200
and you can ask questions and see some examples.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,760
So today, right now, we have [name] here,

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,600
who actually, I think, is the newest member of our team, technically?

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,960
Yeah. It's been nearly a year now, but technically, I'm the newest member.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:11,360
Yeah. So anyway, what's your background? How did you end up here? What did you study?

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:23,880
Yeah, I think it's maybe a bit of a sort of winding garden path. So I started as, well,

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:33,280
I started studying, originally I started studying Japanese and computer science as a side, then

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,280
switched that to studying bioinformatics, which is computer science with a focus on

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,760
some biological science. And I picked neuroimaging for that. So then I, I studied

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,920
further to do neuroimaging. And that's what I did there was mostly analyzing lots of neuroimaging

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,560
data. And yeah, I continued doing that for a little while, did my PhD, did a postdoc.

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:18,880
And yeah, I came to Aalto as a postdoc. And then at Aalto, I met, it must have been around

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:31,600
the Corona time, I met people from SciComp. So did you come here in 2019? Yes, I came to Finland in

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:45,360
2019, November 2019. And then, I don't know, I was in Finland like four or five months when the

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,800
the Corona lockdown started,

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,040
and everyone went basically working from home.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,960
And my research group sort of didn't really have

27
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,560
a good on staying online presence.

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,560
So the psychon chat and partly the code refinery chat

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
sort of became my coworkers, my office.

30
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Yeah.

31
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:26,120
And yeah, then I kept working as a postdoc for quite some time still.

32
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah.

34
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Right.

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
For, I guess, five-ish years.

36
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah.

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Ish.

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Okay.

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:43,640
And then in the meantime, my husband had gotten to work as an RSE, and then at some point

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:52,680
I applied and got a position here. Okay, nice. Yeah. So was there, well, the next question I

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,600
have written, what led for the transition from science, like the direct academic science to

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,240
research support? And I guess the obvious answer is it was a job, but is there anything?

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:19,160
No, actually, it's not so much it was a job. Because for me, I've been always more interested

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,460
in doing the computation and not so much in getting the results and not so much in interpreting

45
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:34,060
them and writing them up. So to be honest, if I were on an academic career path still,

46
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:44,260
I would probably be failing right now because I'm rubbish at writing papers. So that's

47
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:54,740
one reason. And then there was also, so when I was still a postdoc, I started actually

48
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:02,100
trying to chat with a colleague who's also sort of into computing a lot, talking about

49
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:13,460
about that in NeuroImaging, there's a lot of code being written, but many people don't

50
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:23,780
know how to structure code, what to look for to make code reusable and readable in 10 years

51
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,580
time or even in two years time.

52
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,820
So we then decided we're going to do a little workshop, just for newer ending.

53
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:47,100
And that was something that I really, really liked, teaching people about how to do programming

54
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
really.

55
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,980
And yeah, that was one more reason why I wanted to do more of the teaching to code and less

56
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,660
of the actual science interpretation.

57
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,540
Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, then that's perfect, then. Yeah.

58
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,380
That's where I really wanted, I really, really wanted to go get that kind of position.

59
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,580
And would you say that's what you're doing now?

60
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:25,940
Yeah, I guess. I mean, there's the kickstart. And there's also a lot of other sort of

61
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,100
of small things. When people come to the garage and they've got a problem with their code,

62
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:39,660
we had a few people coming just lately that said, oh, it's running so slowly, we need

63
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:47,860
some help here. And then that sort of turned into a slightly bigger, let's help you restructure

64
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,900
the project and get it into a bit better shape so we can actually get started with improving

65
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:03,660
the how fast it runs. And that kind of thing. And then there's lots of other projects that

66
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,300
aren't really teaching that are more like trying to get the code done, but that's fine as well.

67
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,260
I do like coding. So I'm quite happy, actually.

68
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:24,140
Okay. So before, let's say when you were offered the job, were you worried about making the

69
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,420
transition anyhow, and how did it turn out?

70
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:37,300
Well, I wasn't so worried because I knew the team quite well. I've been in contact with

71
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:48,020
it through, well, since 2020, I guess, with the one or the other person. So I kind of

72
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:58,900
knew what I was getting into, and I'm still sort of on a retainer for my old postdoc project.

73
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,620
So I do still work a little bit on the science side.

74
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like a slow transition.

75
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
It is really.

76
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:19,620
I also had the same, like, I kept working into other things for a while.

77
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:29,620
What do you know now that you wish someone else had taught you when you first started as a researcher or like your first

78
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:41,780
I wish I had known when I started my PhD that use version control and use it regularly.

79
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,860
Like, it doesn't really matter whether it's Git, which is the thing that people use most at the

80
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:56,100
moment now, or I had come into contact with Subversion before that, which is a bit

81
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:06,940
bit more complicated and less featured, I would say, than Git, but it works. Anything

82
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:21,500
is better than having files by date with the code or having final, final.1, final.2, and

83
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,100
kind of thing is because it's a mess. Any sort of version control is better

84
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,980
than what you can come up on your own. And you will need it.

85
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,860
How often have you had something where you've edited some code and it's somehow broken and

86
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,580
you've spent days trying to undo the breakage because you can't figure out what it was?

87
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,820
Because that's happened to me many times.

88
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:59,020
Yeah, well, I don't know how many times, I remember a few, I mean, it's always something

89
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,060
breaks and then there's the, especially in science, if you've already sort of written

90
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:12,500
up a paper or presented a poster, and then you notice there's a mistake in the code,

91
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:21,860
you don't know, has it, does it affect my results? That's, I think, the worst kind of thing

92
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,940
that you can ever, that happens and it happens. Yeah, yeah. I know the feeling.

93
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,940
Okay, so next up, what would you say to someone who might be interested in careers outside of

94
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:50,420
tenure track. Well, already it's great that you're thinking out of the box, basically,

95
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:58,900
and interested in this. For me, it was mostly sort of talking to people to get to know what

96
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:12,660
is out there and it doesn't even have to be someone outside academia. A lot of the stuff

97
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:22,660
how I got into the RSE bit was talking to my colleagues who had heard about this and who

98
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:31,460
had heard about that. And then there was the CodeRefinery Coffee Hour. Actually, that's

99
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:38,580
quite a friendly place to go to, or it was when I was going there. And you can just chat to people.

100
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:45,220
No one bites. Even if it looks a bit intimidating, no one's going to bite you.

101
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,820
And I guess you could say like all the people at Aalto that are helping you,

102
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,700
if you ever want to chat about other stuff. Yeah, I mean, we're here for that. You can

103
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:05,220
chat in the process of other stuff or whatever. Actually, I think a few times I just went to

104
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:15,780
Garage because I didn't really have a problem, but I wanted some company of people who

105
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:26,100
know how to code, I guess, and have a similar mindset.

106
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,900
Your department here was Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, so were you sort of

107
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,860
the coder, computer person of the research group?

108
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:42,380
Well, strictly speaking, that would have been [name], because I wasn't the only one. I was

109
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:56,500
more or less the junior one. But yes, I was one of the people who knew how to code in

110
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,980
a field where not everyone knows how to code.

111
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:07,940
Yeah, yeah. And I guess that sort of leads to the next question. So what would you recommend

112
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:14,180
or what do you think someone could do to prepare for, you know, some more diversity of careers

113
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,220
after they're done with their degrees or postdocs or whatever?

114
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:28,900
Well, I think just realize that it's not as clean cut as it sometimes sounds.

115
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:40,820
And to not stress about, if something doesn't go, you do your bachelor, you do your master,

116
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,420
you do your PhD, and then you get a postdoc, and then after two years you get a professorship

117
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
or whatever.

118
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,940
That's not how it goes.

119
00:13:49,940 --> 00:14:04,380
When I was still a student, I met a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute, which is a very

120
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,220
high-profile research organization in Germany, if people don't know.

121
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:18,880
And he, I think he started out as a gardener, and he said, yeah, don't bother.

122
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,240
Don't bother with the pre-set path.

123
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Don't worry about it.

124
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,720
Everyone finds their niche.

125
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,980
If you just want to find something, you will.

126
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,080
It might take a while.

127
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:43,440
It might be frustrating, and yeah, it's going to be frustrating, but don't stop believing,

128
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
basically.

129
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Yeah, okay.

130
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,800
And that sort of, yeah, that gave me some, I guess it gave me some peace of mind, because

131
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,280
my path isn't the straightest of them all.

132
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Yeah.

133
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,920
And it hadn't been back then already, because I had changed degrees and changed universities

134
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
a few times.

135
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Yeah.

136
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Okay.

137
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
So, last question, and we can...

138
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Yeah.

139
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah.

140
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Go ahead.

141
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Last question.

142
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
We can look at some of the notes.

143
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,600
you want to continue learning and what comes next?

144
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,320
I continue learning all the time about things that I didn't know about. So I can't say

145
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,760
what I'm going to be learning next time. I don't know who's going to come into Garage

146
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,920
tomorrow and say, hey, I've got a problem with this and then I'm going to learn about

147
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:42,040
it. Because that's something that happens quite often that I don't really know in-depth,

148
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,960
but I know where to look.

149
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:55,400
Yeah. Okay. So there's some interesting questions in the notes. Do you use ChatGPT or similar?

150
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Well, me personally, I do not, at least not really regularly. I've used it a few times

151
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:12,640
to just get like a bit of a code snippet or just an answer that I didn't want to Google

152
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:21,840
about, or just to try it out. I could have just as well Googled it and found it out myself.

153
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:30,380
And I'm a bit, well, I'm a bit worried about everyone using ChatGPT because people then

154
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:39,340
tend to forget that it has a lot of downfalls and it starts hallucinating things.

155
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,200
You can't actually really trust it.

156
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,340
So you need to check it anyway and then some other source.

157
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Yeah.

158
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Okay.

159
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:59,500
But I know that a few people use it for things that are easy to check and you can see the

160
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
answers there.

161
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,740
Yeah, we can see what people have written there.

162
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,260
What's the most exciting thing you've worked on?

163
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,460
Well, the most exciting for me is the teaching.

164
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,980
I guess you're relatively don't have that many projects yet, but yeah.

165
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,020
I don't have that many projects, but yeah, I think for me, the teaching is the most exciting

166
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,020
thing.

167
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,020
Yeah.

168
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,500
The thing that I'm nervous about before and then sort of elected after.

169
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:44,060
Yeah, next one, what's the most important skill you look for when hiring RSEs like people

170
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
for our team?

171
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,700
Yeah, I guess that would be your question to answer.

172
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,260
That's more, yeah. But my answer is there, like, it's easy to find people that have good

173
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,940
technical skills, but harder to find the people that want to use those skills to help other

174
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:11,660
people instead of just only developing the skills for themselves. And that's sort of

175
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:25,180
main thing there, if you ask me. There's a question recommendation for someone in neuroscience,

176
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:33,420
but maybe you can answer that by writing afterwards. Here's an interesting one.

177
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,860
Most common easy-to-learn fixed mistake people work with high-performance computing make?

178
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:46,540
what's the most challenging part. This is a good one. We should actually discuss this all

179
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,860
as instructors at the end of the day or end of the course. Do you have any thoughts now?

180
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,140
Or should I try to answer? I think you've got much more experience than I do.

181
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,740
So once someone was talking about how hard it is to learn, how to teach people how to use a cluster,

182
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:14,140
And my comment was, if you know sort of the Linux operating system, like command line,

183
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:21,420
how files are stored, the Linux fire hierarchy, and stuff like that, then it's relatively easy

184
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,860
to add in the extra bit to the cluster. But when you're learning to cluster, most people tend to

185
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,380
be learning how to submit jobs. At the same time, they're learning how to write shell scripts,

186
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,700
how to ssh there, how to use the command line. All these things at the same time,

187
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:46,060
everything depends on everything else. So it's quite overwhelming, even though if you

188
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,780
knew everything except one thing, that one thing would be relatively easy and make sense.

189
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,780
So that's my take on it.

190
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:05,780
I think the first bit of the first comment is quite something important there.

191
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,780
How to look for parallelism, because if you really want to use the power of the cluster,

192
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,780
you want to run things in parallel.

193
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:23,780
And getting into that sort of mindset of identifying what can I run while I'm doing something else

194
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:31,780
and not doing it step by step by step.

195
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:38,780
Like usually when we're teaching, a lot of the time it's like you do this first and then you do this

196
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,780
and then you do this and then you do this.

197
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:51,180
this, and then taking this, what you've learned about the flow, and then trying to think what

198
00:20:51,180 --> 00:21:05,020
can I actually do out of order? That's something that's somewhat hard to grasp, I guess.

199
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,060
So unfortunately, it's time to go on. I guess we can keep answering questions about this

200
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,000
later or find us, talk to us later. Next up is a session that's about Conda. I guess the
