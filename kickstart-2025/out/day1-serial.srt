1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Yeah, first focus on this one.

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,360
Yeah.

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,800
So should we advance and do the batch job now?

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,160
I think that's what was next in the notes.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,720
Yes, if you didn't.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,120
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,040
So let's do a batch job for this one.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,480
Yes.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,560
So now in the batch job, we introduce you

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
to what's called a slurm script or shell script.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,200
So this is the first time we're going

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:36,600
make a new file on the cluster and in this file we will put the instructions to slurm to say what

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:45,480
resources are needed and the instructions to our code to tell it what to run and it will all look

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,680
quite familiar with what we've done so far. So to edit a file on the cluster we'll use the

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,400
editor named nano so it's a really basic editor it's not fancy at all but it's simple to use it

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,760
It tells you how to quit it from within the editor.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
And from what we can tell, it's on every cluster.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,240
So it's a good starting point.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:17,280
So we're calling the new shell scripts count1grams.sh,

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,800
where the .sh means it's a shell script.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,560
So [name] pushes Enter, and Nano opens.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
So the shell scripts always start

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,780
with what we call a shabanglang for like hash bang

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,260
with bang being exclamation mark.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,820
And it tells it this will be a bash script.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,820
So bin bash, bash is the shell that we're using.

27
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,220
So it's the-

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,340
And this is basically like the kind of magic

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,860
that is like, like you will always just write this.

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,540
Like how often, like when you start writing these scripts

31
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,100
you often get into the automation

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,180
that you will always write the shabang this.

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,380
You can use different ones

34
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,060
But usually, it's easier to just.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,380
It's like some magic words.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,500
You open the, you're making a magic spell.

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,180
You give the standard magic words at the beginning.

38
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,820
And it's something that you copy from the cheat sheet

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
every time you do it.

40
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,500
So now we see the comment symbol and sbatch here.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,460
So this sbatch is an instruction for Slurm

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,060
to read and do something here.

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,300
And now we add the same options we did from the command line.

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,180
So for example, we'll tell it that it needs memory one

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,540
gigabyte and sbatch time equals 10 minutes.

46
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,740
And we could add whatever else here.

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,860
OK.

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,860
And should we add then the thing that we want to run?

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,820
Yeah, so now we get to the actual shell.

50
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,420
And we'll enter basically the same thing

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,540
we typed ourselves there.

52
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:10,220
So ngrams count.py, words, and then Gutenberg fiction.

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,140
Actually, do you know the file name of the thing?

54
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,180
Yeah, it's below there, down there.

55
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,860
Yeah, you can copy from the note down below.

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Should we try to do two grams, actually, like now that I think of it, should we do two grams?

57
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Yeah.

58
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Yeah.

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:39,820
So, if we add here, what's it does in, we can get two grams, I think.

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Yes, dash lowercase n.

61
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,820
So, now we count word pairs, right?

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,820
Like how many word pairs we can get.

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,340
So let's save this file.

64
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,100
And actually.

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,380
And saving with Control-X and then pushing Y.

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,900
Yeah.

67
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,660
And actually, I'll rename it to 2grams.sh.

68
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,740
That's so now it's save under a different name.

69
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,540
Yes.

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,980
Yes.

71
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,060
It's a better name for the file.

72
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,700
So.

73
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,980
So.

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,260
OK.

75
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,100
And now we actually do the running.

76
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,540
So this is it.

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,940
We run the command sbatch, and we give it the script file.

78
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,380
And with luck, there won't be any errors,

79
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,820
and it will start running.

80
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,380
Yeah.

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,460
I'll try to be fast here.

82
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,420
Yeah.

83
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,220
So [name] will push, enter, and immediately run slurm history.

84
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,420
No, it already finished.

85
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,940
Actually, maybe slurm queue.

86
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,760
Yeah.

87
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,260
Yeah.

88
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,760
So now this is sort of a wide thing here.

89
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,600
And maybe I'll push it.

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah.

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,520
So there's several key Slurm commands

92
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
that you will need to know.

93
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,520
One, well, actually, so this Slurm

94
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,160
is only available on our cluster.

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
So on other clusters.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,480
I think it's also on some other clusters.

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,060
But it's not part of the Slurm installation,

98
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,080
but it's present in many clusters.

99
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,140
Yeah.

100
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,380
Yeah.

101
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,540
I'm writing some stuff in the notes here.

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,140
So sbatch.

103
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,700
But you can, there's other commands like squeue.

104
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,460
Yeah.

105
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,540
You can use as well.

106
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,580
But OK, so what's the general thing?

107
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,020
We basically, we made our food order

108
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,860
and we handed it off to the manager, so the Slurm.

109
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,020
And now Slurm has a queue of everything there.

110
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,820
And when you type Slurm queue, that tells you what's queued.

111
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,500
And we see the second command.

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,120
Now it's done running.

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,500
So we can type the command Slurm history

114
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,500
and see the status of how it ran.

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,980
So Slurm history needs to be 8 by 12.

116
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,140
It's OK if it scrolls off the screen some.

117
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,220
Yeah, that's good.

118
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,700
So we see here in the history, there's

119
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,420
three jobs with IDs that end in 10, 43, and 30.

120
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,380
So it tells us the job name.

121
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,740
And we see for the last one, it's count2grams.sh.

122
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,260
So that's the file name we submitted.

123
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,740
When it started running, it said it

124
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,260
requested one gigabyte of memory.

125
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:47,500
And it used 602 megabytes of memory.

126
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,620
So 2 grams took a lot more memory

127
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
to compute than 1 grams.

128
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,540
That's good to know.

129
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,700
It says it took 22 seconds of CPU time.

130
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,060
And towards the end, we see the state

131
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,260
is COMP, which means completed.

132
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,100
Yeah.

133
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,820
And at the end we can also see what was the name of the computer, like the nodes where it ran.

134
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:22,740
So you can see that some of these other programs run on this pe78 and this run on pe8. This is not

135
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:30,820
usually important unless you run into problems or something and then if the computer breaks or

136
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,900
something and you need to contact us that hey my code didn't work but usually like

137
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:45,700
the queue manager can decide which computer can fill your things fill your requests and it will

138
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:56,260
decide the best computer to run it on yeah um yeah and that's basically it so with this

139
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:03,140
as you learn more and more shell scripting, or not, if you don't need much more, you can start

140
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:13,300
making these programs that will do more and more for what you do. Yes, and also an important thing

141
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:23,060
with the script, when we now run the stuff, we run it non-interactively. So when we submitted

142
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,500
the job, but we immediately didn't see any output or anything. What good is that if I don't see

143
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:40,900
anything? The reason is that Slurm will divert the output to files. If we look at the count

144
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:51,380
n-grams again, over here we have the output of the Python code itself, or the count.py.

145
00:08:51,380 --> 00:09:00,360
We use this to divert the output of the counting program to this file, but Slurm will also

146
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,200
record everything that the program prints out, and that will be saved into an output

147
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
file.

148
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,040
You can change the name of this output file as well, but the default is that its name

149
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,000
is slurm, then dash, and then the job ID.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So the job that we run, the job ID discount n-grams, we get an output file out of here.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,560
So we can later use pager less to view what was the output over here.

152
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,180
So we can see that this is what the code program printed.

153
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,520
So it's the same as we would have run it interactively.

154
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,080
We get the output over there.

155
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,520
So often in your program, you might have program write some output into the disk, but you also

156
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,320
want to print out, okay, what it is doing and if it's encountering problems and whatever.

157
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,840
And you can later see them in these output files.

158
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
Yeah.

159
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
Okay.

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,280
Should we give people time to work themselves now?

161
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Yes.

162
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Let's see.

163
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,680
I will info add.

164
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,000
When should we come back?

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
we come back five minutes before the end time,

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,560
and we can briefly wrap up.

167
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,920
Yes. I will add, yeah.

168
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,120
It may be a little bit short on time to do this,

169
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,000
but if so, it's okay.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,600
The course will be over and then you'll have

171
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,520
time to work on it yourself before tomorrow.

172
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,520
We'll keep answering questions afterwards.

173
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,320
And did we mention how in the Slurm history command,

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,800
it showed what Slurm tracked as the resource usage, which is?

175
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,600
We can talk about it tomorrow in the monitoring.

176
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
Right, yeah.

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
While we're talking about the other monitoring as well.

178
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
Yeah.

179
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,160
And I guess we will, in the notes,

180
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,440
will add the commands that we ran,

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
so that way you can copy from there.

182
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,520
Yeah.

183
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,020
Yeah.

184
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,640
OK.

185
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,800
Well, good luck.

186
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,200
See you in about 20 minutes.

187
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,120
And yeah, have fun, and be happy with your first Slurm jobs.

188
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,520
This is an important day for you.

189
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
Maybe I shouldn't be so philosophical.

190
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,680
Okay, see you later then.

191
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Okay, bye.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
Hello and welcome back.

193
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,600
So sure, a lot has happened here in these notes.

194
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,520
In the bottom, there's a place you can respond if you finished the things. That would be good

195
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,280
to figure out. Also, we've started adding some feedback at the bottom. So, just like before,

196
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:14,520
this is a poll. You can add the O's in order to say if it's too fast, slow, basic, advanced,

197
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:26,840
whatever, and any other feedback for us. So I had several things from the questions I'd like to

198
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:35,240
bring up, but it might take a bit too long to go and actually find them through the material,

199
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,240
so I'll just say it. First, one important thing to note, once you have the batch script file to

200
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,160
run things, now your work is reproducible. So if you save the batch scripts that you run

201
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,960
and you come back in a month or six months or a year and need to run the same things again,

202
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,360
you can basically figure out what arguments you gave and how things should work. And that's really

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,520
important and shouldn't be underestimated. When you're doing this scientific work,

204
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:09,400
you have to remember things for a long period of time. And if, for example, a year from now,

205
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,760
you have to try to do something again for paper revisions or to verify the work,

206
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,240
having these batch grips will help you quite a lot.

207
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:26,040
Next up, many of the clusters are different. So we saw something down here, for example,

208
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,920
on the CSC computers, you need to specify the account and partition for every job you run.

209
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,000
So on some clusters, it sort of automatically does it because the time isn't tracked by project.

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,240
So this is another case where you need to find the reference for the cluster you're using and then

211
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,200
well, you know, copy that and translate it to what your work is doing now.

212
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,360
Next up, there was some point a question about the output files.

213
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:10,280
else. Where does it save the output? Okay. Maybe like this here. So there's different

214
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:19,000
types of output that a script can have. One is the output files that the code itself makes.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,800
And the second is what the code is printing to the screen, which is what in the Unix world

216
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
is called standard output or standard error.

217
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,360
And this standard output and standard error

218
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,760
gets captured by Slurm and then saved

219
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,920
to a file for your reference.

220
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,120
So basically, there's two kinds of things that happen.

221
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,220
So your program runs, it saves the main results,

222
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,600
and then the information about how the program itself ran.

223
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,560
And usually, it's the second one that you

224
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,400
would look at to figure out what happened

225
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,440
if it didn't work correctly.

226
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,200
So, yeah, these dot out files like this are very,

227
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,960
okay, I can't select,

228
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,800
very important to look at when things go wrong.

229
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,200
And even when things go right,

230
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,760
just to make sure that it's going right the way you expect.

231
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,440
Yeah, and maybe we didn't emphasize enough

232
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,120
in the, when we wanted to get to the exercise

233
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,160
as quickly as possible,

234
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,000
why are we even doing this script?

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,400
So the important part is that you want to program to the computer what you want it to do.

236
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,400
You want to tell it what to do. And in the case of Slurm, you want to tell the Slurm that, hey,

237
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,320
I want you to do this thing for me, and I want you to give me the resources and do it somewhere

238
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,720
when I'm not watching. Basically, in the kitchen metaphor, you're just asking

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,560
basically you're ordering food from a restaurant, like you want somebody else to prepare it

240
00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:01,280
to you at a later date and you will get it done later. So you want to be able to tell

241
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,880
the instructions to the computer in a way that it understands what commands it should run

242
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,840
when it goes to the compute node. And the output is basically the way that you can then monitor

243
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,880
what it actually did. So in your code, you can have print statements and stuff like that,

244
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,840
that will tell, okay, I am now doing this, I'm doing that. And especially if you're running a

245
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:36,480
job in the queue, you might want to monitor what it is doing. But if you submit it to the queue,

246
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,760
you don't have an interactive session there, which is a benefit because you can then close

247
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:48,000
a laptop and closer connection, nothing will break. It will run remotely there, but you want

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:57,120
to monitor the output and that's why you have the output files. Yeah, okay. And the last one I wanted

249
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:06,720
to note, which can I find it from here, is the difference between sbatch and srun and bash directly.

250
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:16,720
So sbatch will take a script file and hand it off to slurm to run it sometime later non-interactively.

251
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,080
srun when used directly from the command line will try to run something through slurm but right now

252
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,440
attached to your terminal and it doesn't read the different sbatch comments that are inside of a

253
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,720
shell script. And finally if you run something with bash only it doesn't know anything about

254
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:49,520
slurm and will just run it where you are directly. So this is something that

255
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
well you don't have time to go much more into depth than this now but if you read a little

256
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,800
bit more, you'll see us discuss this a bit more in the notes. Also, I mean, we're out of time now,

257
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:13,920
and there is, like, this was very fast. Like we said at the beginning, it's impossible to give

258
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,600
a course that will teach you everything about the cluster, about Linux, about the shell,

259
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,240
about version control, about the data storage within 10 hours.

260
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
So we aren't even trying to do that.

261
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,560
Instead, we're trying to give the broad overview

262
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,120
and show some demos and have good materials for you

263
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,680
to follow up on just the parts you need later.

264
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,480
Because also, everyone needs different parts

265
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,600
for their own work in the future.

266
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
So not everyone can sit through weeks of courses

267
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,600
to learn all the details.

268
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,880
So don't feel overwhelmed if it's overwhelming. I mean, yes, it is overwhelming. We know that,

269
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,000
but that doesn't mean that you personally need to feel overwhelmed. It just means that you are

270
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,040
learning things. With that being said, is there anything else we should talk about,

271
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,440
[name], before I go to the final notes of the day?

272
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,600
Yeah, I'll add that there was a good question of, like, is it not possible to write the

273
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,200
commands directly on the command line instead of writing them as scripts?

274
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,240
And yeah, like that's of course an option, but that requires then you to have the terminal

275
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,600
open and writing them and remembering to write them in the correct order.

276
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,400
And that's like extra effort that I don't personally want to do.

277
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,560
So that's why usually you write the scripts because they tell exactly what to do.

278
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,800
They tell the computer exactly what you want the computer to do.

279
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,440
And then you can tell the computer that, hey, do this for me.

280
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,720
And it will run those for you, run the commands that you specify for you.

281
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,200
And you can later see that, okay, these were the commands I used to run my code.

282
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,360
was the actual, like, what was needed to run my code. And you don't have to be there typing

283
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,240
the commands, because the computer basically, the queue basically types those commands for you.

284
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,720
Like, when it gets the job reservation, it will type those commands in the Slurm script into

285
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,240
the terminal, and it will run those. Yeah, like, for example, there have been

286
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,240
times I needed to use the cluster. I had one thing I needed to run that uses 200 megabyte,

287
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,280
or 200 gigabytes of memory.

288
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,200
So there, I'll go and I'll run it direct from the terminal.

289
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
I'll load the data, do a quick calculation,

290
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,560
and be done with it, because it's only a single thing.

291
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,080
But when I need to do something 100 times,

292
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,440
because I have 100 different data files,

293
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,680
then I want to make scripts for it.

294
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,600
So yeah, it's what's it called?

295
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,080
Spectrum of ways you use things.

296
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:13,640
Yeah, so for tomorrow we covered what was on the schedule and if you look on the schedule

297
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:21,320
there's the same stuff, links to it, in tutorial format that has more information.

298
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:31,380
Yeah, so you can read that and catch up, learn more, whatever.

299
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,420
we know you might need more time for the exercises,

300
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,180
so keep working on it later

301
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,180
or for the rest of the day today, tomorrow, whatever.

302
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,200
Maybe we can even make a Zoom session in the morning

303
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,960
to review things for those in Finland.

304
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,140
Or ask your colleagues, your friends, whoever for help.

305
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,020
I mean, a lot of the things here,

306
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,640
it's hard to do by yourself,

307
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,180
but if you have another pair of eyes

308
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,300
who knows things looking at it with you,

309
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,380
they can help you quite a bit.

310
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,100
So find that person who will help you.

311
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,940
And what we did today is needed

312
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,660
in order to continue tomorrow.

313
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,900
But also that means what we do tomorrow

314
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,940
will help to review what we did today.

315
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,900
So if it doesn't completely make sense now, it's okay.

316
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,820
Take it for the day, digest it a bit, think about it.

317
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,420
When you come back tomorrow,

318
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,180
we'll start again from the beginning.

319
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,700
Well, beginning like, you know, what's it called?

320
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,980
You'll see new examples starting from the beginning.

321
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,300
and that may help to put things into perspective

322
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,340
and understand the power of what we do here.

323
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,660
For example, we'll take the Gutenberg books

324
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,580
and run it for every book in parallel,

325
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,300
and it will be really easy and very fast.

326
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,660
And please do fill out the feedback poll here.

327
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,620
There is, if you don't tell us what went wrong,

328
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,920
it's hard to improve it for later.

329
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm glad that things are mostly looking okay here.

330
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,640
And yeah, we realized that we need better instructions

331
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,080
for what we do before the lecture.

332
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,900
So we've recently created a new example.

333
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,640
Before our example was calculating pi, now it's Gutenberg,

334
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,480
and all the written material isn't updated for it.

335
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,040
So that makes it just a little bit, well.

336
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, we didn't have a good thing to point you to.

337
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,120
conundrum with this course is that if the example is way too of a toy example, it doesn't reflect

338
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,680
the real situation. And if it's closer to the real situation, it can become more complicated.

339
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:49,520
And we try to adapt everything all the time. But yeah, sometimes, especially when we are doing

340
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,080
doing a switch from one example to another,

341
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,640
the material doesn't necessarily follow immediately.

342
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
So yeah, that's unfortunate.

343
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,760
We'll definitely improve that in the next iteration.

344
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,520
Yeah.

345
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,440
Should we just end now?

346
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,200
We will keep, there's a question somewhere up above.

347
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,320
Do we have homework for tomorrow?

348
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,320
the homework is just to try what we did, read stuff. I mean, basically the homework is to

349
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,800
keep reading and trying stuff until you feel comfortable with it. There's no strict homework

350
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,280
like, you know, you're not going to be graded or whatever. You're only here for your own benefit.

351
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,200
And don't forget, if you're not coming back a future day,

352
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Once you're done with this course, come to our garage if you're at Alto and ask for help.

353
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,200
We're here to help you to see you through all of these steps.

354
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
You're not alone.

355
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Yeah, okay.

356
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Should we go then?

357
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Yeah.

358
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Okay.

359
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
See you tomorrow.

360
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Same time.

361
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,720
I just saw in chat that yes, we can have a Zoom session before the day starts

362
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
tomorrow.

363
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,600
So if you're one of the Finland people that has access to the Zoom, stay tuned for an

364
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,040
email to come and get help then.

365
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,680
Okay, now let's go for real.

366
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Okay, bye.

367
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,180
Bye.
