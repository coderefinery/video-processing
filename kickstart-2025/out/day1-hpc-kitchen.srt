1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
All making tons of heat.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,340
OK, here we are.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,020
So we're talking about parallel computing in the kitchen.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,140
So this is sort of a metaphor we've

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,580
been developing to make, oh, you need to see me.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:29,840
Yeah, this is a metaphor we've been developing, because oftentimes people will come to our

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,660
courses and expect to start using the cluster and think, ah, well, this is a supercomputer,

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:44,280
so everything must be super fast. Well, actually, it doesn't quite work that way. It's a bit

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:53,000
more subtle than that. So after many years of working here, we've sort of found a way to explain

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,840
it using a kitchen. And if you look at the video playlist that's here, you see one of us basically

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,080
going to the kitchen and pointing to different things and explaining how this is a computer.

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,400
But we don't have time to watch all that. Hopefully you could watch before or will

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,160
a watch later, but let's just summarize it a little bit.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,320
So first off, what is a computer?

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,160
What do all the parts do?

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,800
This is why we're here right now,

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,960
to explain what these are.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:35,200
So on the left side is a blade server from a server computer.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
This is probably part of the old Triton.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,720
And on the left side is a desktop computer

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,440
that has what looks like four GPUs in there.

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,080
So how do these compare?

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,280
They're actually more similar than you think.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,240
So in this metaphor, what are the different parts

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,800
of a computer?

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,000
So first off, there's the, well, in the metaphor,

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,960
I take the stoves to be the different computer cores.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
So the stove is where you actually do the computing

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,520
and you cook stuff.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,720
The processor has multiple cores inside of it.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,600
So these days, four is a pretty typical number

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,040
for processors for cores in a processor

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,640
of a general purpose computer.

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
The people doing the cooking are the processes.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,960
So basically, you need some code that's

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,920
running to actually use the processors and do things.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,920
The memory is the counter space, so basically where

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,200
you can leave all the stuff lying around

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
and things that happen.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,960
The food you're cooking is the data.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,200
And you have to do things like move the data

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
from the refrigerator first to the counter,

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,440
and then prepare it, and then copy it into the pot

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,520
on the stove to do the actual cooking.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,360
recipes, or programs, and so on.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
So this is the main point here.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,120
So is a cluster faster than your own computer?

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
So here I have, on the left side,

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,320
a about 1.8 kilowatt induction countertop cooker.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,040
And on the right side, my stove.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,200
So does the stove let you cook something like pasta

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,320
faster than this induction cooker?

53
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,840
And the answer is probably not.

54
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,880
Their power output is really quite comparable.

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,460
So it might be a little bit faster, but really not much.

56
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,800
So why do people use the stove?

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
Can even be slower, I would say.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Yeah.

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
So why do people use the stove?

61
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,820
So actually, recently, a few months ago,

62
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,180
I had a friend that their stove broke.

63
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,340
So they borrowed this induction cooker and were they happy?

64
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,460
So they were not happy

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,180
because they could only cook one thing at once.

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,080
And that's the main thing here.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,940
The supercomputer lets you do a relatively normal thing

68
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,640
but many things at the same time.

69
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,300
So imagine a factory kitchen that has

70
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,300
you know, hundreds or like 10,000 different stove

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,760
or burners in it,

72
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,060
then you can start cooking a lot of stuff.

73
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,340
So what else?

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,760
So it's really important when you're doing your cooking

75
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,120
to understand the memory hierarchy.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,900
So if the data are ingredients,

77
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,140
there's different tiers of storage places you can put that.

78
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,340
For example, stuff can start in the fridge.

79
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,620
And if when you're cooking,

80
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,940
have to go to the fridge to take every single thing you work on, that's pretty slow. But if

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,300
you take it out of the fridge and put it on your counter close to the stove, then you can do your

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:24,060
preparations and stuff a lot faster. And managing this sort of data flow is one of the big things

83
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,620
on the cluster. Also on your own computer, but it's sort of too small to really notice.

84
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:41,620
It's also very often that on your own computer you do have a comparatively fast hard disk which a lot of the compute nodes in a cluster just don't have.

85
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:54,620
So there is no local disk that it can quickly access and that essentially means that you need to go to something slower on Tendency or keep it in memory.

86
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,220
there are some machines that have local disks but even there you if you want to use it you need to

87
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:10,060
first move this move your data over from the fridge to the local disk kind of yeah

88
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,220
let's see is there anything else to talk about maybe i won't go over this um you can read it

89
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:26,860
yourself. But the main point is that it's not that much slower to take something from your fridge

90
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,980
as it is from the countertop. But on a computer, the processor cache and main memory is many orders

91
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:41,900
of magnitude slower. The difference there is orders of magnitude. So you really have to start

92
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,580
worrying about this. Imagine if every time you needed to get something out of the fridge, it took

93
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,860
took you several hours to go grab it.

94
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,540
That would really change the way you do the cooking,

95
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,260
and you need to do much more planning there.

96
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,060
This is one of my favorite pictures.

97
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,660
So what happens when you don't have enough CPU or memory?

98
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,980
If you don't have enough processor,

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,100
then stuff is just slower.

100
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,660
You cook it a little bit slower.

101
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,380
But once you don't have enough memory, you can't do anything,

102
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,180
and stuff becomes really slow.

103
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,820
And that's why when you get a better kitchen,

104
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,380
it's not really more burners you get.

105
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,220
It's more counter space.

106
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,900
And this is something I wish more people would realize,

107
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,020
not mentioning anyone or anything.

108
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,820
But yes, so I think let's stop here.

109
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Maybe we discuss a little bit before we go to the next part.

110
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,180
There. So any questions or comments?

111
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,180
Nothing in the slides yet.

112
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,180
Or yeah, in the documents yet.

113
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,180
One comment that I give is that

114
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,180
you might really experience

115
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,180
the situation that something runs in a certain time on your local

116
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:25,740
local machine, and it's actually running slower on the cluster, on a single CPU, if it's single

117
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:36,140
CPU. So, most desktop machines are actually pretty fast nowadays, if they are not purely

118
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:48,220
office machines. That's a good point, yes. It's just something I want to mention, to lower

119
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:58,860
expectations as to what the cluster can do again. You can do more things at the same time,

120
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:07,580
you can run the same computation a lot of times at the same time compared to your own desktop.

121
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:16,300
But the computation itself will not be faster. Yeah and that's something I think if you go

122
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,940
deeper into the slides you eventually get this and at least I cover it in the videos.

123
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,660
So when you start to use a cluster you're not a cook anymore. You're not someone that's making

124
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,540
one dish in one kitchen. Instead, you're becoming the manager of all the chefs.

125
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,100
You have to take your problem, divide it into something that 10 or 100 or 1,000 people can do

126
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,620
at the same time. You make the script to divide up all the data or all the problems so that all

127
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,140
these different cooks are working separately and then recombine things together. And that's why

128
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,220
why the cluster seems so difficult and interesting.

129
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,420
And if you don't need to divide stuff up

130
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,540
among lots of people to do it more quickly,

131
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,660
then a lot of what we're talking about

132
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,540
isn't that important overall.

133
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,900
It just sort of, you know, it's OK.

134
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,860
But when you do, the cluster saves a lot of time.

135
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,700
And one more comment I want to give,

136
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,580
because that's also mentioned now in the notes here.

137
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:29,100
But it commonly takes quite a bit of effort to go or to make

138
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,620
your code actually use multiple CPUs if the libraries you're

139
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,100
using do not, under the hood, already do that.

140
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,620
So it's also often a question of,

141
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,060
is it really worth it spending the time to make something

142
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:54,580
work in parallel when you could potentially just run it

143
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,100
multiple times for smaller problems.

144
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,580
So how you divide things can be important as

145
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,980
to getting quick and useful results

146
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,980
and how much time to invest into certain parts of the code.

147
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,540
And on a general principle, if you

148
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,460
can divide your problem into smaller parts it's way preferable to trying to actually parallelize

149
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,900
in code. So rather run the same thing or the almost same thing 50 times than try to implement

150
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:44,820
that this is now using 50 CPUs. Yeah there's a question about what's a GPU and I just really

151
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,020
like this picture I got, not because I eat chickens.

152
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:57,060
But so the CPU, the processor, can do basically,

153
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,380
and you can cook anything on the stove.

154
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,260
But a GPU is a very specialized cooking appliance.

155
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,820
So with this appliance, you can cook one thing.

156
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,100
You can do some things in parallel, in high parallel.

157
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,540
And very fast.

158
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,340
So this, I think, you could cook maybe 20 chickens at the same time on here.

159
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,180
But how much pasta can you make with this chicken cooking device?

160
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,780
And the answer is basically nothing. It's not designed for it.

161
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,900
So if your problem, like the GPU lets you do something in parallel a lot and very fast,

162
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,700
but only certain types of problems can be adapted to the thing that the GPU is made for.

163
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,740
And if you haven't adapted the code

164
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,380
and put it in the right modes and all that kind of stuff,

165
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,340
the GPU will just be wasted.

166
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,580
OK, well, I think we should go on.

167
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,540
Yeah, it's time to go.

168
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,000
And go towards connecting to a cluster.
