3.2 GPU computing - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

GPUs, short for graphical processing unit, are massively-parallel processors that are optimized to perform parallel operations. Computations that might take days to run on CPUs, take substantially less time on GPUs.  We discuss how to use them with Slurm and what are some common pitfalls when running these programs, but we don't go into detail about just how they are programmed or anything like that.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
