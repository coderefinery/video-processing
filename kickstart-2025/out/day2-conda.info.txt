2.2 Conda - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

Conda is a package manager, not just for Python packages, but many types of scientific software: Python, R, compiled libraries, and so on.  It's become the easiest way to install a wide variety of software, whether on your own computer on or the cluster.  Here, we demo the basics, but you'll need to study the details for recommended practices of whatever cluster you work on: there may be different recommendations to preserve disk performance and so on.

Mamba is an interchangeable replacement that is much faster at resolving the dependencies.  We mainly use Mamba.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
