1.5 Setting up for a new project - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2025

How do you get set up on the cluster?  This itself can be a bit of a process.  We discuss creating your directories, copying your code and data, and doing an initial test of the code.  We don't cover using the command line shell, data storage, and a lot of other important things in depth, but we have links to all of that.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2025 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters and related scientific computing skills like data management, reproducible research, GPUs, etc.
