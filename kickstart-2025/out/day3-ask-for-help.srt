1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Okay, yeah, some fun with the streaming stuff there. Okay, so welcome.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,180
The first talk is this,

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,020
How to ask for help with supercomputers.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,120
This is actually not my talk,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,180
not my slides, though I've contributed a bit to it.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,380
It's by one of our colleagues,

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,540
[name], who worked in Norway,

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,980
basically doing a lot of the same stuff that we do.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,140
What's the point of this talk?

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,340
To give you a perspective of whenever you come to us,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,700
when should you come to us and how to come with us,

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,140
and ask us things.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:49,180
So yeah, what kind of help is available? When to ask? Especially this like how to write a message

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,340
that looks good and we can answer quickly because we probably both want to be able to

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,260
for you to be able to answer stuff or to have good messages so we can answer quickly

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,520
and a little bit more advice on getting started. So yeah, here's the credits.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:17,580
There's some people you know there. Okay, so when you need help with something,

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,260
what are the different places or ways you can ask for the help? So there's

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,060
different things available. So often a good place to start is asking your

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,340
colleague. So it's really simple to ask someone who sits at a desk next to you, hey, have you had

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,100
this problem? If they say yes, then that helps you. If they say no, then you can keep working

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,980
on it yourself before asking again. There's these official, like, live help sessions,

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,900
garage office hours, stuff like that, search engines, chat, the real information.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,780
One interesting place is that you can search, if you're at Aalto, the issue tracker we have.

25
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,300
So we ask people to make their issues there in public, so that way you can help all the

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,460
next generation of things. That also encourages us to give better answers, because we know that

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:25,420
it won't be helping just you, but all the people in the future. Anyway, people sometimes wonder

28
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,460
when do you ask for help? So should you work on it forever? Are you going to get bitten if you go

29
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,660
ask for help? Is that seen as a bad thing? So my philosophy is that computers are way too complex

30
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,820
these days and no one can possibly tend to know everything they need to know about it. It's just

31
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,180
too much. Even within our team here, we have a policy that if you don't know something, ask

32
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,700
someone with a really low threshold because it's just not worth spending time trying to

33
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,420
solve a problem that's already been solved. Unless, of course, you want to

34
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,460
do an exercise to solve it. But, you know, your exercises are probably the actual research or

35
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:15,020
other work you're doing and not some solved computer problem. But do at least try a little

36
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,260
bit yourself, do your googling, start at the lower levels, and then work up as you see it's needed.

37
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,340
You know, basically do enough that you learn something so next time maybe you can

38
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,020
solve it yourself or know where to look for the future.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,620
So this is an advice I got when I asked someone what do you wish you knew now that

40
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,860
what do you know now that you wish someone had told you? They had this philosophy. So,

41
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,900
for every problem they had, they set an internal limit in their mind. So, they might say, okay,

42
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,380
I'm trying to get Python to run on the cluster. I think it's reasonable that it should take me

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,340
an hour to do that. So, I'll work on it for an hour, and then I'll go to the

44
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:11,580
Science IT Garage and ask for help because that's the reasonable thing. If it's

45
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,780
not done within an hour, then there's clearly something wrong here that is taking much longer

46
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:27,020
than it should. When you ask for help, if you come especially to our live thing, you can ask,

47
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,140
can you do this for me? Can we do it together? Or you could ask, should this be a hard problem?

48
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,660
am I looking the right direction and should I keep going with where I am?

49
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,460
And at least if you come to us and you say, is this the right direction? Like, can you help

50
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,820
point me in the right documentation? Am I looking at the right page? We're happy to say, yeah, it

51
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:52,060
looks like the right page. And then you can keep working and come back the next day if you need to.

52
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,780
So, I guess if you're seeing this talk, you've already seen a lot of the people that are on

53
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:09,180
the other side here. But the people answering are also humans and we're also not great at

54
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,180
everything. We're not superheroes or something. We just try to be as good as we can.

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,340
So this says something for the other side. So we do a lot of work in our team to try to

56
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,460
teach, like remind people that we need to be nice when people are coming to us. So we have

57
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,220
people at all sorts of different levels of education, or not education, but different

58
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,820
points in their careers, knowing more or less who are studying computers or are not studying

59
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,260
computers and it's just some sort of tool, and we need to be respectful and understanding of

60
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,740
all these different types of things. And on the other hand, realize that, yeah, like it says,

61
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,660
Because we don't know everything either.

62
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,620
We're also really busy with possibly too many problems.

63
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,380
So this is an example from the author of these slides.

64
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,800
So someone wrote a super long message saying something, and it was actually hard for the

65
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,260
person who was reading it to figure out what you even needed.

66
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,740
So they responded with this one-line email saying,

67
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,820
oh, I guess you want to get the code.

68
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Sure, here it is.

69
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,580
So it could have been a much quicker request there.

70
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,260
It's good to have a good email subject and things like that.

71
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,860
So of course, you don't know what the actual problem is,

72
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,340
but try to give a little bit of clarity of what it is.

73
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,020
Because when someone goes to the issue tracker,

74
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,780
they see a bunch of titles.

75
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,060
and they'll start at looking at the stuff that they think there's the highest chance of them

76
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:02,900
knowing and answering first. So that is something like my job is crashing today but not tomorrow

77
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:10,180
or yesterday. Then we know, okay, so this might be something that has changed in the last day.

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,660
we can look in there more quickly.

79
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,740
It's good to have all this different context.

80
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,260
So the more we know about what happened better.

81
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,500
Sometimes someone will send a request saying,

82
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
hey, my job isn't working.

83
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,900
But they don't say what cluster they're on.

84
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,580
So if you send it to the Alto people, that's obvious.

85
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,420
But if you send it to, for example, CSE people,

86
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,580
that's not obvious at all.

87
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,100
And that just makes more time that has

88
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,240
to be spent to figure that out.

89
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,980
Or we have to send something back saying,

90
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,860
can you please tell us what you actually did?

91
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,420
And that's not fun.

92
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,680
And we don't want to just say, reply always with,

93
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,220
well, we don't really like your request, so just tell us more

94
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,540
so we don't have to do anything.

95
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,220
The more initial stuff, the better.

96
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,660
So anything special that might be here?

97
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,540
Is there anything special about the environment?

98
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,100
Are we allowed to look at your files directly?

99
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,820
And so on.

100
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,900
OK, and this is something that I had thought up.

101
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,060
So there, as soon as you see these lists of how to ask

102
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,660
questions, and it's a long multi pages of do this, and this,

103
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,860
and this, and this.

104
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
And that's basically saying, we don't

105
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,740
want you to ask questions because we

106
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,620
I want you to have done all this other stuff first.

107
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,900
So I tried to narrow it down to like a really simple thing.

108
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,340
What are the most important things for us to know to answer

109
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,500
without making it seem too overwhelming?

110
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,800
And this is what it is.

111
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,260
So has it ever worked?

112
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,860
So if you're trying to run your first job on the cluster,

113
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,220
that's a lot different than the jobs works yesterday,

114
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,340
but not today.

115
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,940
If it's never worked at all,

116
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,420
that means we need to start with a much broader perspective.

117
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,900
If something worked yesterday, but not today,

118
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,940
and you know it's the same, we know to immediately ask the person that's been working on the cluster

119
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,380
recently and, hey, have you changed anything? Did we just break something there?

120
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,180
And what are you trying to accomplish? So not just like I'm trying to run this job on the cluster,

121
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:28,260
but I'm trying to run, what's the program? I'm trying to run PyTorch on the cluster to do

122
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,740
inference or whatever. So we'll see a little bit more about this later, but having the big picture

123
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,060
of what you're trying to do is important, because if we don't have the big picture,

124
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:47,300
we might give a too specific or too general answer somehow. Actually, no, I'll come back to this

125
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:56,900
later. So what did you do? So what have you actually typed and done there? If you say,

126
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,140
my job doesn't work, but you don't give the job script, well, we'll be like,

127
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,340
please tell us the job script or whatever.

128
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,980
The more you can copy and paste, the better.

129
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,620
I recommend don't use screenshots because we

130
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,780
can't copy and paste text from screenshots.

131
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,580
Also, it doesn't appear in

132
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,820
the e-mail messages we get and so on.

133
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,460
But go to the terminal,

134
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,100
copy, paste it into the message.

135
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,380
It doesn't matter if it looks bad,

136
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,460
we can dig through it.

137
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,900
And this is like the exact commands you ran, the files,

138
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,860
stuff like that.

139
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,500
It's usually better to give more stuff rather than too few

140
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,660
stuff, because we're quick at scanning through all this text

141
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,900
and seeing what we need.

142
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
And it doesn't take you very long

143
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,020
to copy and paste relative to trying to describe it.

144
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,020
And finally, what do you need?

145
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,020
So are you looking for a complete solution to someone

146
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,220
to solve the problem for you and give it back to you?

147
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,140
Or are you looking for, hey, is this expected?

148
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,100
Should I keep working on it?

149
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,880
If you say, I just need help with this one little bit,

150
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,580
that's OK.

151
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,540
If you say, hey, I'm completely overwhelmed with what this is,

152
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,740
can we look in more depth and do it from the beginning?

153
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,820
Then we can start reserving time and doing it that way.

154
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,740
Especially if you need something small,

155
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,460
say that you need something small.

156
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,580
That helps a lot.

157
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,700
Yeah, this is the tell us what you tried.

158
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,980
So have you tried narrowing it down?

159
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,820
Is it failing in only one way or multiple ways?

160
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,300
There's different ways to tell us

161
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,940
how you've done the narrowing.

162
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,380
And this is something that has been called the XY problem.

163
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,720
There's some website around it.

164
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,660
I don't know where it came from.

165
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,220
But the problem is that someone has a problem.

166
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,020
They try to do some solution to the problem.

167
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,740
The solution doesn't work, so they ask

168
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,300
about what the solution is.

169
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,100
Like, I can't run this or that script.

170
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,660
We go, we help them with that solution,

171
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,220
and then it turns out that they were

172
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,140
trying to do the original problem that wasn't actually

173
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,020
a good solution to the problem.

174
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,780
So we could have said, hey, you're

175
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,720
trying to get a content environment solved,

176
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,780
do you know we already have an environment

177
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,700
that's designed for LM usage

178
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,260
and it probably has what you need,

179
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
so why don't you use that instead?

180
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,460
So basically this big picture is quite important

181
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,860
so we can see, do we need to take a step back

182
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,180
and go down a different way?

183
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,380
Also, if you don't do this,

184
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,100
there's a problem that the staff will answer

185
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,980
the one exact question you answer

186
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,420
then say okay it's done and close the issue because they get measured by how quickly they

187
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,940
close issues and how few issues there are so yeah

188
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,260
I guess this is more advice for us that are here but if you're ever helping people

189
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,860
think of these kind of things so it's important that we the staff answering make the person

190
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,980
realize or think that they're valued and we want to actually help them. The worst thing to do is

191
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,060
send back different links saying have you read these pages first what you need is in here and

192
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:39,860
then like a two sentence answer or something like that. So we try to consider this and do well

193
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,100
but if we're ever not perfect we're sorry and it's okay to let us know.

194
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,100
So when you send requests, I guess

195
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,780
this is perhaps more from other people.

196
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,700
I guess it basically applied to us.

197
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,900
So when you send a request in written format,

198
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,500
it goes to a issue tracker.

199
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,900
And then there's a bunch of issues there.

200
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,620
And the people coming have to find what's available.

201
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,020
So at least within Aalto, we sort of all

202
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,340
try to look at it and ask the right person

203
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,860
to answer it no matter what time it is. But at some point, in some organizations, there's like

204
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,940
one person that's answering for one week and then they have multiple weeks when they're off

205
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,180
and doing other work. So there can be very different types of people answering these questions.

206
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,700
And if something takes too long and you don't get an answer, then consider asking a different way.

207
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,780
if you're at Alto, then come to our daily garage

208
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,700
and ask questions.

209
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,980
Because if we get a written message

210
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,980
and it's not clear what the question really is,

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,200
people are always going to first work

212
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,780
on the ones that are more clear.

213
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,900
And if you come talk to us live,

214
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,820
then it is much easier to do this quick back and forth

215
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,060
and narrow things down and that works better.

216
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:14,300
OK, we're a bit running out of time,

217
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,980
so let's not go into this too much.

218
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:22,220
But example request, I'm this username.

219
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,460
I'm trying to do something.

220
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,340
I can log into the other clusters.

221
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,940
I can't log into this cluster and the exact message

222
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,100
that's there.

223
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,860
This is a pretty good request.

224
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,220
So it gives the context.

225
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,180
It gives what does work.

226
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,020
And then it gives exactly what doesn't work.

227
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,620
And from us, at least me as a cluster admin, if I see this,

228
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,540
I immediately know what to look at.

229
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,060
And I will check something.

230
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,780
Here's another request.

231
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,820
So it says, I'm not sure this is the right support.

232
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,940
I'd like to do this and that.

233
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,860
They're asking for a web server and a database.

234
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,960
But then they say, this is the kind of thing,

235
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,160
like this is what the big problem is.

236
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,020
So we look at this and can say, hey, for 2,000 records,

237
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,080
that's really not much.

238
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,960
Maybe you don't need a full database.

239
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,320
And here's a much easier way to do things.

240
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,400
And we save you and us time.

241
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,860
So it was very important that they

242
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,200
gave this extra piece of information

243
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,720
about sort of the size of the problem and the usage.

244
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,680
Okay, maybe I'll just stop here.

245
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,280
You can read here a little bit later

246
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,000
or maybe I'll summarize.

247
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,040
Yeah, so the summary here is that

248
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,200
when you go to a new computer for the first time,

249
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,980
don't immediately start with the biggest thing possible.

250
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,280
Start with the smallest job.

251
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,220
Like we started with an interactive job on one core

252
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,180
and then a serial job, a batch job on one core.

253
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,860
and then a few multi-processing. So start small and slowly work up so you can tell at exactly what

254
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,020
point it stops working and it stops being efficient. And then that helps you to figure

255
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,820
out only one thing at a time and it helps us to know where the problem is. Okay, and with that

256
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,220
being said, I will shrink the screen. When you are with us,

257
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,300
we have this thing called the Scientific Computing Garage. This is an Aalto University thing.

258
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:43,540
I think some other people might be trying it some. But the basic idea is that

259
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:51,140
that every workday at 1 o'clock, we, as in a lot of us,

260
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,340
instructors and more, are in Zoom.

261
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,980
And you can drop by and ask us any questions.

262
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,340
This is a time you can join and share screen and sort of show

263
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,460
us what's going on.

264
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,800
You can ask, oh, is this a real problem?

265
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,500
Should I do this?

266
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,140
Should I file a issue request about this?

267
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,580
And so on.

268
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,540
And well, that's basically it. So it tells a lot about stuff here.

269
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,980
Join us and ask for help with a low threshold. We have multiple people coming per day.

270
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,700
And yeah. Oh, and finally, I'm running out of time here, but if you're new and you're at

271
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,060
Alta University, we have people that have time in the next few weeks specifically to help with

272
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:54,500
new problems and new questions. So, by all means, if you're new, okay, basically everyone that's

273
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,660
starting new projects as a summer intern, we're trying to have time for you to come and spend

274
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,060
an hour, half an hour, whatever, talking with someone live about how you're doing the problem.

275
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:16,060
And we can't do everything in one garage next week, but we'd like for all of you to try to find the time to come by and have a quick chat with us.

276
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,060
And we think we can probably do it in the next month.

277
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:27,060
So, who knows how this will work, maybe we'll send an email with more instructions for reserving time or something like that.

278
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,060
But, um, yes, please do.

279
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,880
So OK, with that being said, I'm done.

280
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,920
Hopefully this was a sort of useful starting point.

281
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,000
And next we have GPUs, I believe.
